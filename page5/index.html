        The Good People and The Criminals
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Dec 2012</span>

    <p>In the wake of the awful shooting in Newtown, Connecticut last week I've been searching for the perfect words to say. I still haven't found them, and I may never will, but my high school friend Beth posted her thoughts on Facebook. They are pretty much the most reasonable words I've read so far, and with her permission I repeat them here...</p>
<blockquote><p>There is something missing from the discussion about guns and violence and mass shootings going on this past week. The underlying assumptions about people. The "guns don't kill people, people do" folks assume there are two clear distinct groups of people: criminals and good people. If good people are armed, they can thwart the criminals. We can't "punish" the good people in our attempts to control criminals.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I reject that view of the world. We are all just people. We are all capable of being loving and caring. We are all capable of being selfish and fearful. We can all be overwhelmed by grief, terror and yes, even rage. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I readily confess to my darkness. I get pissed off while driving. I become too protective of the ones I love. I rage against the machine. I reach the end of my rope and become irrational. And when I do, the world is a safer place because I don't have a gun on my person. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I enjoy shooting. I really really do. And I have pretty decent aim. But I think we are all safer for me not having a gun on my person at all times. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When does a "good person" who deserves to have a gun become a "criminal" who we need guns to stop?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I maintain we are all a bit of both.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Some random points from our <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/10/08/antalya-and-london/">visit to London</a> last month.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/8231128036" title="View 'IMG_1186' on Flickr.com"><img style="float:right;" border="0" alt="IMG_1186" width="240" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/8231128036_de59d8944c_m.jpg" height="180" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Taking the cheap train from Gatwick to London makes a whole lot a stops and is probably not worth the trouble</li>
<li>If you are at all claustrophobic and get cold shivers from the elevator scenes in Speed, you certainly want to avoid the Covent Garden tube station at all costs. Only way out are crowded elevators or 193 steps.</li>
<li>If you're German by nature and get to Buckingham Palace 90 minutes before the Changing of the Guard, the friendly bobbies will make sure no late-coming tourists will cut in front of you.</li>
<li>The employment profile of the hospitality industry in London is dominated by Eastern Europeans. Pub food is, however, tastier and less expensive than we had been led to believe.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.robroypub.co.uk/">Rob Roy</a> is a Scottish pub near Paddington where you can be served haggis, if your pipe-learning son is so inclined and you can wait for the cook to come in for the evening shift. </li>

<li>The streets and train stations are impeccably clean, even by German standards.</li>
<li>The tube stations seem to have been planned to ensure the longest possible walk when changing lines.</li>
<li>Greenwich is a bit out of the way but a nice quiet base to stay. The DLR gets you to central London in 20 minutes, and Sainsbury's Local will meet all your basic food and drink needs.

        Touch 'Em All

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2012</span>

    <p>I was somewhat stunned to read that today is the <a href="http://aarongleeman.com/2012/10/25/twins-notes-40-man-cuts-declining-capps-baker-talks-and-25-years-ago/">25th anniversary of the Minnesota Twins winning the 1987 World Series</a>. Given that I am now 50, that is half my life ago. And while a sports event certainly didn't play a direct role in our lives, it marked a milestone. 1987 was an important year for us that eventually brought us to Germany.</p>
<p>For one thing, we actually saw a lot a Twins games that year. We lived in south Minneapolis, we could easily bike to the Metrodome, and the bleacher seats in center field cost just $3. And they were the best seats in the house, since we were right behind the center fielder Kirby Puckett, and could see him make his spectacular catches. We watched at least a dozen games live, maybe even 20, but did not attend any playoff or World Series games.</p>
<p>For me, that fall of 1987 was the beginning of my PhD program at the University of Minnesota. But I was beginning to have my doubts as to whether I was cut out for an academic career, and the choices involved to get academic funding. As an Agricultural Economist, let's just say the locations for research are not among the metropolises of the world (Davis, Iowa City, Norman, College Station, etc.). So it was really the beginning of the end, and 6 months later I dropped out.</p>
<p>As for my wife, in the fall of 1987 her first boss was in the process of selling his McDonald's franchise in Minneapolis to move to Arizona. Her superior and many of her colleagues would move to Arizona too, and after a year of sticking it out with the new franchisee, we ended up moving to Arizona as well. We weren't able to find a place with her old boss in Arizona, but made the connections that brought us to Germany in 1990.</p>
<p>So October 1987 was a turning point in our lives, and it just happened that the Twins won the World Series that month. Was it really 25 years ago?</p>

    <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2012</span>

    <p>Despite my attempt to <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/08/16/travel-blog/">start a travel blog</a> a couple of months ago, we don't actually get out and about that much. Owning a business and having a school-aged child just cramps our style somehow. So it's somewhat unusual that this month, we have not just one, but two (count 'em. two!) foreign trips planned.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hotel_100.jpg" alt="Hotel 100" border="0" width="100" height="75" style="float:right;" />The first is this week and actually a business trip. We all (we're taking number one son out of school for 3 days) fly to Antalya, Turkey, for the annual fall franchisee meeting at some luxury hotel built for Russian oligarchs. It will be warmer than home, though, and we are extending our stay by a night so we have all day Saturday to ourselves before flying back just in time for school and work on Monday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AlMdzRpCEAA3-f5.jpg"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AlMdzRpCEAA3-f5-300x224.jpg" alt="" title="AlMdzRpCEAA3-f5.jpg" width="300" height="224" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4844" /></a>The second half of October our son as fall break from school, and I'll be cashing in <a href="http://twitter.com/papascott/statuses/167510377884684288">my birthday present</a> from my family, a 5 night trip to London. Of course, "birthday present" means 1) the entire family comes along, and 2) they only come up with the idea and I get to do all the planning myself. Despite having lived in Europe for over 20 years, we've never been to London so it will be all new to us. All I know about London is that it's wonderful and expensive, so we'll be staying in Greenwich and be taking the train a lot to see the sights.</p>
<p>After that we'll be all travelled out for while.</p>
