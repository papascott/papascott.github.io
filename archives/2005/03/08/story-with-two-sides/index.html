  <p>Christopher's Story: On our way back from my first day of ski school, I stopped for a few moments to play in a hill of snow. When I looked up, Mama and Papa were gone! They must have gone back to the cabin without me! I knew that our cabin was just up the hill, so that's where I went, but I couldn't find Mama or Papa's footprints in the snow. Then I couldn't remember which of the cabins was ours... and I started to cry. Then a nice man came out of one of the houses to help me. He called his neighbor to ask if she knew a little boy, and then he took me to her house. There in the street was my Papa! I ran to him, and he thanked the nice man many times. We then called Mama, and when she came we all promised that next time we lost each other, we would go back to where we had last seen one another and wait.</p>
<p>Papa's Story: On our way back from Christopher's first day of ski school, we went inside to check his registration. When I went back outside to check on Christopher, he was gone. He had been playing on a pile of snow in the hotel parking lot.  Within a few steps was the hotel, a restaurant, a construction site, and the ski hill. He was nowhere to be found. We put out an announcement in the restaurant ("Christopher, your parents are looking for you, please come to the cashier!") and in the hotel. 30 minutes had passed, and we were starting to panic. Our cabin was just a 5 minute walk... maybe Christopher had gone home. We decided that I would go to the cabin while Mama waited in the parking lot where we had last seen him. As I got to the door, the lady next door asked if I was looking for a little boy. Her neighbor had called saying he had found him, and they were coming right over. At that moment a man with Christopher turned into our street. Everything was alright! I thanked the man many times, then ran with Christopher inside to call Mama with the news. When she came we all promised that next time we lost each other, we would go back to where we had last seen one another and wait.</p>
<p>This has now become Christopher's favorite bedtime story, even more popular than the "day Christopher was born" story.</p>
