  <p>Through soft living and not sticking to my gym schedule, I'm carrying 5 kilos more than 3 years ago and the suit I bought then is too tight around the belly. And the suit before that hangs like a tent. Why is fashion so unforgiving? But we have a gala event in Berlin to attend, and Christopher also needs the appropriate attire, so yesterday we were off to Hamburg to visit <a href="http://www.policke-herrenkleidung.de/">Policke</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.policke-herrenkleidung.de/historisches-kaufhaus.html"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/02-01-11.jpg" alt="02 01  1" border="0" width="250" height="216" style="float:right;" /></a>I <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/12/11/advent-advent-ein-anzug-brennt/">blogged about Policke</a> 11 years ago when I got the suit before that. It hasn't changed much since then¬Ö</p>
<blockquote><p>Mama was convinced that I needed a new suit for her company Christmas party next weekend (her first formal appearance after maternity leave, although she officially starts on January 2). My main criteria in choosing a profession was to avoid wearing suits. I hate buying clothes, but it¬ís even worse to discuss or even argue about buying clothes, so I kept my mouth shut (well, nearly shut) and went along with Mama and Christopher to Hamburg early on Saturday.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We went to Policke, an old-fashioned men¬ís clothier in Hamburg¬Ö not chic downtown Hamburg, but the nitty, gritty inner-city neighborhood of St. Georg, located across from a Turkish bank and some porno shops, between a mosque<sup>[<a name="mosque" href="#footnote">*</a>]</sup> and a Good Templar¬ís Club. The shop looks like it hasn¬ít been remodeled since the 1920s, and maybe the staff hasn¬ít changed since then either. There¬ís hardly room to move¬Ö the tiny rooms are stuffed with suits.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It¬ís impossible to browse. You are met at the door by the chief salesman, who measures your exact size by eye alone, and are sent to the appropriate room. I told the salesman there I need a dark colored suit for a Christmas party, he picked two out that both fit perfectly and met Mama¬ís approval. I picked one, and we were out in 15 minutes, paying a least a third less than we would have downtown, and were home before the crowds arrived in the city.</p></blockquote>
<p>This time the service was even quicker. The first suit tried on fit and was right, so I was done in 10 minutes, and I paid half of what I expected.. Same thing for Christopher: 10 minutes in and out, much cheaper than we expected.</p>
<p>Even more amazing¬Ö before we shopped, Christopher insisted he didn't need a suit and didn't want to go to any gala in any case. Today he spent 45 minutes trying his new suit on and admiring the look.</p>
<p><sup>[<a name="footnote" href="#mosque">*</a>]</sup>At first I was afraid the mosque was the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Mosque_Hamburg">Al-Quds</a> mosque where the 9/11 plotters met, but that was around the corner on Steindamm, a couple of blocks away. The mosque on the same street as Policke is the <a href="http://www.centrum-moschee.de/">Centrum Mosque</a>, and tomorrow they happen to be holding an <a href="http://www.centrum-moschee.de/images/stories/diverse/tom_2011_plakat.pdf">open house</a>.</p>
