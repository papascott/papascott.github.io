        I am not an Expat Blogger 1: The Language
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>I've always thought of myself as an "expat blogger in Germany", but lately I'm not so sure. Reading blog posts from my fellow expats usually results in shrugs or a WTF. Maybe I'm becoming out of touch, or I'm not a very typical expat… (the first of a <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/category/not-an-expat/">series</a>):</p>
<p><strong>I don't speak English.</strong> In real life, outside the internet, I speak almost no English at all. We speak German at home (my wife and I made a deal to always speak the language of the country we're in to one another… we'd be in big trouble if we ever moved to France!). My job (business) is all German. Other than the proprietor of our local Baja California restaurant, I know no native English speakers (and she's actually a US-born German).</p>
<p>Back in the '90s I worked for an English-language publisher, where we had a mostly-English-speaking office (Brits slightly outnumbering Americans). These days, though, about the only English I speak is when I phone home to my family, or I'm helping my son with his English homework from school.</p>

<p>We arrived to find a <em>maître d'</em> at the door, a table set in a quiet corner with candles, flowers and tablecloth, a printed menu, and a hostess ready to take our order.</p>

<p>We chose to split the special of the day, the <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/produktfinder.html#/steakhouse_classic">Steakhouse Classic</a> in the current promotion as a McMenu with 2 side salads, a side order of Chicken Sticks, and a vintage 2012 Cola Light (Cola Zero for me) to drink. We passed on desert, deciding instead on an Espresso Macchiato to round off the meal.</p>
<p>All in all it was a very nice gesture and great fun, and many thanks to our crew for the idea and the invitation. However, it got us thinking: maybe other guests would enjoy an exclusive, fun and special candlelight dinner at our McDonald's? Maybe it's something we could offer…</p>

        Brawl on the Highway

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2012</span>

    <p>We always thought life in our sleepy little village was pretty quiet, but think again! Freely translated from the <a href="http://kreiszeitung-wochenblatt.de/">Nordheide Wochenblatt</a> (30 June 2012):</p>
<blockquote><p>Brawl on the Highway: a driver goes bezerk over failure to yield</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When reason fails, some people rather trust their fists. That was the case last Thursday afternoon. The result: an injury and a whole list of charges. A driver from Buchholz (51) nearly cut off another driver (59) while pulling out of a driveway in Jesteburg. Both cars continued towards Lüllau when the older driver motioned for the first driver to stop. Both drivers get out of their cars, and the 59-yr-old driver swung a punch at the 51-yr-old. He was able to block the punch and threw one of his own, losing his cell phone in the process. The female companion of the 59-yr-old then picked up the cell phone and threw it onto a nearby field. Despite an intensive search, the cell phone was not found. A judge is scheduled to tell the two drivers what he thinks of their antics. </p></blockquote>
<p>(Our son's reaction: Which highway was that? I want to find that phone!)</p>

        Follow Me to Bubble Tea
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 May 2012</span>

    <p>Time for a business post! A couple days ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/papascott/status/204798796243283969" title="4 big changes coming to German McDonald's in the next 3 weeks! Never a dull day for us!">teased on Twitter</a> that big changes were coming to German McDonald's in the next couple of weeks. I was going to wait until the marketing started before going into detail, but now that the <a href="http://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-dienstleister/neuheiten-bei-der-fastfood-kette-bei-mcdonalds-perlt-es-bald-seite-all/6674690-all.html" title="Handelsblatt: Bei McDonald’s perlt es bald">Handelsblatt newspaper has spilled the beans</a>, it's OK to come out now.</p>
<p>The big one comes on June 11, when McDonald's starts selling bubble tea in McCafé. Bubble tea is a trend drink that originated in Taiwan and is fairly new in Europe. It's basically sweet tea with fruit syrup and tapioca "boba" pearls or flavored jellies. The bobas or jellies sink to the bottom of the cup and can be sucked up through the straw. With 2 sizes, 3 types of tea, 7 flavors, and 6 flavors of bobas and jellies, there are over 250 combinations possible. Bubble tea is sweet and certainly not low-calorie, but generally contains less sugar than soft drinks. There will be a coupon in the the June coupon booklet if you want to give it a try.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bubble-Tea-50.jpg" alt="Bubble Tea" border="0" width="266" height="354" align="left" />Bubble tea is the fastest growing segment of the fast food industry and is very popular for 13 to 20 year olds. Bubble tea shops generally import their ingredients. The jellies and bobas for McCafé Bubble Tea are produced in Germany especially for McDonald's and contain no additives. Bubble tea is a first for McDonald's in Europe (maybe worldwide?), and if it is successful here we're sure other countries will follow.</p>
<p>The second change is not so spectacular. Starting June 4 McDonald's will sell Brötchen for breakfast, three types of normal German Brötchen: Kaiser-, Korn and Laugenbrötchen, either with traditional condiments (butter, jam, honey, Nutella) or as a sandwich. Brötchen have been very successful for McDonald's Austria and we think they will be here, too. The marketing people call it "local relevance". We just think that if you want to sell breakfast in Germany, you have to sell what Germans eat for breakfast, so it's a change we welcome.</p>
<p>The other changes are already out: a new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/mcdonalds-deutschland/id524943492">McDonald's Deutschland iPhone app</a> with in-app couponing (starting with the June booklet, not exactly cutting edge anymore but it's a start) and new lower price-point <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/mcdeal.html">"McDeal" menus</a> that cost 3-something instead of 5- or 6-something like the "McMenüs".</p>
<p>That's a whole lot to learn and train the next three weeks, but hey, if we wanted jobs where each day is just like the day before, we'd be in a different business. :-)</p>

        A Tale of Two Glasses
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 May 2012</span>

    <p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/twoglasses.jpg" alt="Two Glasses" border="0" width="500" height="145" /></p>
<p>One of the joys of getting older is deteriorating eyesight. Having been near-sighted all my life, my near vision is now getting worse so that I'm now in effect no-sighted.</p>
<p>I have experienced the joy of bifocals for the past couple of years, and have learned to unconsciously tilt my head to the appropriate angle for looking things near and far. Things in the middle (i.e. somewhat beyond arm's length) are problematic, since they are in the transition zone of the lens and one can only focus on a thin horizontal stripe at one time. That makes it difficult to look at a larger surface, like, say, a computer screen, without constantly bobbing one's head to continually adjust the angle.</p>
<p>But modern optometry has the solution: a separate set of computer glasses focused at the distance between your eyes and the monitor. Voilà! I could see the entire screen at once for the first time in ages! However, every medical wonder has a dark side. Or multiple dark sides. The first is having to keep track of two pairs of glasses. Given that one can only wear one pair at a time on one's face, the other pair is always someplace else, and that someplace else is never the same place where one needs them. (I have an app to ping my iPhone when I've misplaced it. There is no such app to ping my glasses.)</p>
<p>Another new problem is that no matter which pair of glasses I have on, they always feel like the wrong pair. Even when they are the right pair. I was at least smart enough not to order identical frames for both glasses. The computer glasses have a ridge on the temples, so I can always feel with my fingers which pair I have on, because I can't tell just with my eyes.</p>
<p>The third problem is that one has to remember to switch glasses when leaving the computer. (Switching glasses when coming to the computer is easy to remember, since the first thing one notices is "Oh, I cannot see the screen!") One cannot competently perform normal tasks when one can only see items exactly 20 inches from one's face. More than once I've caught myself driving away from the house and realizing only then that I have the wrong glasses and cannot see past the windshield. Not good.</p>
<p>So computer glasses are both a blessing and a curse, and have made my life infinitely more complicated than before.</p>
