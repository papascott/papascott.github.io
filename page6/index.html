<p>Twenty-nine years ago today was the <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/09/06/">Tuesday after Labor Day</a> when, as <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/the-river">Bruce Springsteen put it</a>, "the judge put it all to rest".</p>
<p>These days we can only joke about how long it has been. We can still quote the <s>English</s> <s>German</s> (whatever) TV classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner_for_One">"Dinner for One"</a> to one another: "You look younger than ever, love! Younger than ever!" Of course, the line may wear out someday. If someday this blog ceases to be updated and you hear about a particularly gory family drama* from northern Germany, you'll know I tried the line once too often.</p>
<p>*Family drama (<em>Familiendrama</em>) is one of those phrases that in German means something completely different than in English. For us it might mean a TV show suitable to watch with your kids, or perhaps the "discussion" that ensues when a teenaged daughter tells her parents that she is pregnant. In German it refers to a murder (often a murder/suicide) within a family.</p>

        Travel Blog
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>We've just returned from 2 weeks' vacation. I've heard that one can earn fame, fortune and lots of SEO love by writing travel blog posts, so I'll try my hand at it.</p>
<p>We visited my parents' lake cabin in Minnesota. They bought the cabin when I was a kid, and my wife and I have been going there for 30 years, so we didn't really see anything new.</p>
<p>Insider tip for air travel: if you a German traveling to the US, make sure your <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/">ESTA</a> is up to date. Otherwise you might have the joy of flying standby without your family the next day! Trust us, we know!</p>
<p>Since we stayed with my parents, we got a really good deal on lodging. You have to really be an insider to get that rate, though. No way to get it online.</p>
<p>We saved money by not renting a car, but having my parents take us from and to the airport. I doubt that they would do that for anybody else. We did spring for some gas.</p>
<p>As for the local cuisine, you have to catch it yourself from the lake. Or buy it yourself from the meat market. Either way, no one cooks it for you. That's what the gas grill is for.</p>
<p>As for local people and customs, we did have a mini family reunion the first Sunday we were they. Since I've known my relatives all my life, I didn't really get any new insights on local life (although a couple of them did rag on me for not blogging often enough).</p>
<p>I hear that including a picture can increase the influence of travel blog posts. Here it is. My wife has several dozen more just like it.</p>

    <p><strong>I am not gay.</strong> Well, most expat bloggers aren't either, but there's a fair number who are. Must have something to do with the fact that you can marry who you want here.</p>

    <span class="post-date">27 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>(Note: the name of the series has been updated to more accurately reflect the spirit in which it's intended.)</p>
<p><strong>I don't miss American food.</strong> It seems every expat blogger goes through a phase where they're missing some type of food from home, usually something heavily processed and extremely unhealthy. Comfort food. Some expats never snap out of it.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because our business is food (my wife says to add that you're all welcome to buy all the comfort food you want from us!), or because I learned economics and understand supply and demand, but I was never all that emotionally attached to food from home. If there's something you miss, learn to make it (or a close approximation) yourself.</p>
<p>And you can find peanut butter and Oreos at pretty much any German supermarket these days.</p>
