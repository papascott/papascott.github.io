        Extremism in Defense of Liberty

    <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2011</span>

    <p>Yesterday we attended the New Year's Reception given by the mayor of Buchholz. It was a typical political meet-and-greet event, with all the usual suspects in attendance: the county commissioner (<em>Landrat</em>), 2 members of the Bundestag, 1 member of the <i>Landestag</i> (Lower Saxony Parliament). There was shake-hands with the mayor, a glass <i>Sekt</i>, live music on stage, and a couple of optimistic speeches. Other than the <i><a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=amtskette">Amtskette</a></i> the mayor was wearing, it could have been a typical American political event.</p>
<p>It could have been a political event like the meet-and-greet in Tucson where Representative Giffords was shot and six people were killed by a lone gunman.</p>
<p>There is much speculation that the poisoned polarization of American politics may have contributed to the atmosphere that makes such a shooting possible. I think it is unfair to solely blame a certain ex-governor of Alaska for this poisoned climate. After all, the left was all too happy to demonize the G. W. Bush administration (although, demonization has been ratcheted up a couple of notches since the last election).</p>
<p>In Germany I have come to appreciate the multi-party parliamentary political system that values compromise over rhetoric. You cannot demonize your opponent, since your opponent today might be your coalition partner tomorrow. German parties debate the details, but not the basics, of democracy. Right now I have the feeling the American parties do not agree on the basics. And if you can't live with each other, what's left to live for?</p>
<p>We do not now (and may never) understand the motivation of the madman from Tucson. But Arizona (as a state of immigrants from both inside and outside the US) is a Geiger counter for American politics. "Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice", said Barry Goldwater, presidential candidate from Arizona. Right now I'm hoping for some extremism in defense of moderatism.</p>

        Brussels Sprouts with BACON

    <p>OK, it's not really bacon, just low-fat diced ham, but this recipe from our <a href="http://www.myline24.de/">My Line fitness program</a> has become our favorite way to eat Brussels sprouts, even as a main dish! The original recipe is metric, the American equivalents are approximate.</p>
<p>500 g (1 lb) Brussels sprouts<br />
1 onion, chopped<br />
1 Tsp olive oil<br />
50 g (2 oz) diced ham (3% fat)<br />
dash soy or Maggi sauce<br />
75 ml (1/3 cup) broth<br />
50 ml (1/4 cup) dry white wine<br />
a pinch grated nutmeg<br />
1-1/2 Tsp low-fat cooking cream<br />
1 stem fresh marjoram, chopped</p>
<p>Wash Brussels sprouts, steam for 7 minutes. Heat olive oil in a frying pan, lightly brown the diced ham, add onions and fry until translucent. Stir in Brussels sprouts. Add broth and white wine, cover, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, nutmeg and cooking cream, sprinkle with fresh marjoram, and serve immediately.</p>

        Grocery Shopping
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2011</span>

    <p>With my wife and I both having busy and hectic schedules (well, hers is more hectic, mine is mostly pushing paper), coordinating grocery shopping is a constant challenge. </p>
<p>We have a completely low-tech method of compiling a grocery list: a piece of paper tacked to the side of the refrigerator where we note the staples we're running low on (although "running low" is relative, we could have 1-1/2 cartons of eggs in the house, and my wife will still add eggs to the list). When writing on paper on a sideways wall, there's a 10% chance of any particular item being illegible, just to add some randomness to the process.</p>
<p>Another source of randomness is whether one has remembered to bring the list to the store. This is quite logical; when leaving for work, one is thinking about the things one wants to do at work, not about the grocery list. When one is done at work, one thinks "I could buy groceries on the way home", but one doesn't have the list, and one has to wing it.</p>
<p>Now at this point some smarty-pants is going to tell us to use a mobile app to create a synced shopping list. But what would that mean? That means our shopping list would depend on the internet! What if the internet goes down? We wouldn't be able to go shopping, and we'd starve!</p>
<p>Sometimes I will go medium-tech and take a picture of the list with my cell phone. But this can lead to yet another complication: double shopping, since if I take a picture of the list, the list is still there for the next person. We then both spontaneously come up with of idea of going shopping at the same time without telling one another and we end up with 45 eggs in the house.</p>
<p>But once in a great while the system works. I remember to bring the list, everything is legible, everything is in stock at the store, and I can cross everything off the list. But invariably that evening we'll find we can't cook because something is missing and my wife will ask me incredulously, "How can you only buy what's on the list?"</p>
<p>Figuring out how to guess what should be on the list but isn't is an exercise left to the reader.</p>
