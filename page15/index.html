    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.de/Sempe-Keine-Klassik-Aber-Gef%C3%A4llt/dp/B0037L0D1K"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ich-mag-keine-klassik-aber-das-gefaellt-mir-various.jpg" alt="Ich mag keine klassik aber das gefaellt mir various" class="alignright" /></a>The past several weeks our son has been obsessed with classical music. I suspect it has something to do with the music instruction at his new school. </p>
<p>It doesn't come from us. Our consumption of classical music is close to zero. My wife currently has Rihanna and Katy Perry on heavy rotation in her car. Should you ever have the opportunity to drive her car, it is highly recommended to turn the music volume down before touching the ignition, if you value your sense of hearing. </p>
<p>He started taking keyboard classes last fall, and with some Christmas money we got him a basic Yamaha keyboard. It has some canned classical pieces in memory, Für Elisa, Wilhelm Tell, and stuff like that. He'd listen to them and try to play along. I finally got him a CD with some real recordings (<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Sempe-Keine-Klassik-Aber-Gef%C3%A4llt/dp/B0037L0D1K">"I don't like classic but I like this"</a>) so we don't have to listen to the tinny keyboard playback anymore.</p>
<p>Then he came home telling us about Mozart and opera and <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Mozart-Zauberfl%C3%B6te-Gesamtaufnahme-Aufnahme-1993/dp/B0000260AD">The Magic Flute</a> and that he'd really like to see it sometime. It just so happened that a traveling ensemble presented The Magic Flute at our local theatre this month, and since then we have the CD and have to listen to opera every morning for breakfast.</p>
<p>Then this week his school presented an evening with two concert pianists playing Haydn which we had to attend (without Mama, for her that was too much). And now when we hear a good song on the radio, and we tell him "That's a song from when we were young, that's an oldie", he answers, "Not as old as my music!".</p>
<p>Like I said, it didn't come from us. Maybe he was <a href="http://www.ladygaga.com/discography/detail.aspx?pid=2912">born this way</a>.</p>

        Save the World
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2011</span>

    <p>Thirty years ago, I entered college with a mission: I was going to Save the World! I was fresh from a summer in northeastern Brazil as an AFS student and had experienced what the difference between rich and poor really is. Coming from the richest and most powerful country on earth, I was going to have the knowledge and the power to do good, to facilitate change, to make the world a better place. I was going to study International Relations! I was going to learn Diplomacy!</p>
<p>When it came to the nitty gritty content, there were a lot of paradoxical truths to be learned. Like that Mutual Assured Destruction was a good thing and that nuclear weapons made the world a safer place. And that politics is a zero-sum game, so that preventing your opponent from gaining something was just as good as winning. And that a big problem in developing countries are the elite classes in those countries themselves, who either run the country corruptly or go abroad to study and never come back. And another big problem are agricultural subsidies in rich countries, which distort the entire world market for farm commodities and make it impossible for poor countries to feed themselves.</p>
<p>It's all quite depressing, really. I decided that the studying the relationship between money and power was more interesting and satisfying that saving the world, and switched majors from International Relations to Economics.</p>
<p>I mention all this now because even then the US was supporting the dictator Hosni Mubarak in Egypt to the tune of billions of dollars per year, and in the twisted logic of Diplomacy it made perfect sense then as it did until about two weeks ago. And the people running US foreign policy today are people my age who 30 years ago wanted to save the world. Maybe they've switched to other goals. Or maybe they know that in the long run, it's a better policy to foster democracy than to prop up dictators with billions of dollars, but they just don't how to do it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in Economics we say that in the long run, we're all dead. When comparing two long runs, we don't know which one will come first. It's all quite depressing, really.</p>
<p>No, not everything is depressing... it's quite heartening to see millions of Egyptians demonstrating for democracy. I hope they are not disappointed, and that they don't have to wait for the long run for their freedom</p>

        Stranded!

    <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2011</span>

    <p>Last Tuesday we accepted delivery for the <a href="http://www.volkswagen.de/de/models/sharan.html">Volkswagen Sharan</a> that we ordered 6 months ago (with a lot of extras but without the automatic doors like in the cute commercial). It will be my company car for the next three years. Our family isn't really big enough for a mini-van, but there are times we need the space, either for business or for pleasure. I'd love to show it to you, but right now all I have is this fuzzy smartphone photo...</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sharan.jpg" alt="sharan.jpg" border="0" width="450" height="338" /></p>
<p>...because the day after we picked up the car, with 325 km on the odometer, it had to be towed from the Autobahn to the shop!</p>
<p>I was on my way to Lüneburg to pick up our son from school for an appointment, enjoying the music from the very loud speakers, when at 180 km/h the (manual) transmission suddenly popped out of gear and wouldn't go back in. All I could do was coast to the side of the road and call for help, and arrange for an alternate pick-up for our son. My wife was out of town, so she couldn't step in (but she did contact her brother to pick up our son from the bus, and I was able to reach the school to tell him to take the bus instead of waiting for me).</p>
<p>The next day I was told that the transmission was blocked for some unexplained reason and will be completely replaced. The car will probably be ready on Tuesday.</p>
<p>I must say that VW Service performed as well as I could expect. Within 30 minutes I was being towed to the nearest VW dealer, and 1 hour later I was on my way home with a free loaner car.</p>
<p>We've leased all our cars from Volkswagen since starting our business, even for the franchisee herself, and we have a good relationship with our local VW dealer. We're sure this is a one-off problem, and even if not we'll be able to resolve it to our satisfaction. But I have to admit I'll be a bit hesitant the first time I bring the Sharan to full speed when we have it back.</p>

        Back in Black

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2011</span>

    <p>One of the several good effects of our son's new school is that he has developed an enthusiasm for music. We didn't take him to any special music classes earlier (it's something we didn't think of, since neither of us did it as kids, maybe that was a missed opportunity), but with his very first music class at the new school, he decided he it was time to learn an instrument. One of his music teachers offers weekly after-school keyboard lessons, and our son was the first to sign up.</p>
<p>(After school means he misses the bus home and we have to pick him up. Remember the school is a 45 minute drive from our home. Calculate how much fuel we burn to foster his interest in music. When I complain about my Friday taxi-driving schedule, this is what I mean.)</p>
<p>After a couple of months of lessons, he outgrew the cheapy keyboard from the supermarket, so armed with some birthday money from Grandma we invested in a <a href="http://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical-instruments/keyboards/digitalkeyboards/portable_keyboards/psr-e223/">Yamaha E223 keyboard</a>... still low-end, but much better than what we had.</p>
<p>And while we were at the music store (<a href="http://www.musikmarkthamburg.de/">Musik Markt Hamburg</a>, by the way), I decided to scratch an itch I've had for a while. I haven't done anything with music for 30 years, since playing bass clarinet in the high school band. I really enjoyed it then, and seeing how our son is having so much fun with it, I thought maybe I could get back into it...</p>
<p>So I bought a bass guitar and an amp. Here we are showing of our new instruments.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Foto-3.jpg" alt="Boys in Black" border="0" width="450" height="438" /></p>
<p>My sister-in-law's response: is there anything black left on the shelves? (Yes, I'm color-blind, and I am invariably attracted to black. It's the only color I'm sure I see correctly. And if it were red it would be a midlife crisis.)</p>
<p>The bass is a Yamaha RBX170, a decent and versatile beginners' bass, with a Marshall MBB15 amp, which is enough to practice in the basement. My knowledge of bass is starting from zero, and so far I've learned the strings are E-A-D-G and that I'll have to hang weights on my left-hand fingers to get them to stretch enough to cover four frets. I have a couple of books, and can still read music, so we'll see how far I can get by myself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile our son is trying to follow along to Beethoven (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_to_Joy">Ode to Joy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BCr_Elise">Für Elise</a>), listens to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_(Vivaldi)">The Four Seasons</a>, and insisted we get tickets to a tour of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Flute">The Magic Flute</a> when it comes to Buchholz next month.</p>
<p>And he says he's ready to start a second instrument. The violin.</p>
