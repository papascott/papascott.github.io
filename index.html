        Prince

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2016</span>

    <p>I was dreamin‚Äô when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray‚Ä¶</p>

<p>When I lived in Minneapolis, I used to think we were cooler than everyone else because we had our own resident musical genius. That‚Äôs not true of course, but he <a href="http://www.startribune.com/prince-was-one-of-our-own-and-he-made-minnesota-seem-cool/376798251/">made us seem cool</a>. And even after he was rich and famous, he stayed in Minnesota. Most of the time, anyway.</p>

<p>And now in Europe, even before last week I could say I‚Äôm from Minnesota ‚Äúwhere Prince is from‚Äù, and for a few moments I‚Äôm hip and cool. At least until we change the subject.</p>

<p>And maybe, even though I was just a casual fan, that‚Äôs why his death has saddened me. I‚Äôve lost a piece of home. <em>Ich habe ein St√ºck Heimat verloren.</em></p>

<p>To this day, I keep a copy of Dirty Mind (1980) on my current mobile device. It was my first Prince record. It‚Äôs an imperfect album. It‚Äôs sparsely produced, it almost sounds like a demo. And the lyrics, well, Prince was the artist for whom the term ‚Äúexplicit content‚Äù was invented, and they distract from the music. But it‚Äôs tight. Every note, every beat, on every track hits. Just listen to the 2nd side (this was back when albums had sides), with Uptown-Head-Sister-Partyup, beginning to end. It still blows me away.</p>

<p>(My favorite track, though, is on the first side, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_You_Were_Mine_(Prince_song)">When You Were Mine</a>. Mr. LoveSexy turns into a bat-shit-crazy ex. Both funny and sexy as hell.)</p>

        The Ants
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2016</span>

    <p>Our house turns 20 years old this year. And every spring the same thing happens. The ants come into the kitchen for a few weeks. Then they disappear.</p>

<p>Ours is a good, solid German house, made of brick. But we live out in the country, and out in the country one has to deal with critters and creepy-crawly things. The doors and windows are tight, but there is obviously a crack in the outside wall to the kitchen. Every spring the ants wake up, get hungry, come inside the wall, and then maybe behind the cabinets, and find an entry to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Every year they find a <em>new</em>¬†entry. I‚Äôve heard that ants have collective intelligence, and that it‚Äôs probably passed down from generation to generation. They are probably more intelligent than we, since every year we forget that the ants are coming. And then it takes us several days to find their point of entry.</p>

<p>Since we can‚Äôt think like ants, we have to wait until a whole bunch of them have come in so we can see their trail. Then we get out the ant spray, secure the entry, and wait a few days see if they find a new entry and come back.</p>

<p>They usually don‚Äôt. The spring weather gets warmer, and I presume the ants then find it easier to find their food outside rather than risk encountering ant spray inside. But they have the knowledge of how to get into our kitchen, and their offspring will use that knowledge next year, to find a new entry.</p>

<p>Here is this year‚Äôs point of entry, and our weapon of choice. We‚Äôre planning on renovating our kitchen this year. Maybe we‚Äôll find that crack in the wall and get it patched.</p>

        Student Exchange

    <span class="post-date">05 Apr 2016</span>

    <p>We have an exchange student from Italy with us this week (his family hosted our son for a week last fall). We were a bit worried about how to keep him occupied, since we‚Äôre out in the country and far from the school. We needn‚Äôt have worried. The students (hosts and guests) hang out in L√ºneburg after school and they only come home to sleep.</p>

<p>BTW, German is cool in that it was a different word for grade and high school students <em>(Sch√ºler)</em> than for college students <em>(Studenten)</em>. We‚Äôre talking about <em>Sch√ºler</em> here. And that my wife and I met when she was an <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/17/and-i-saw-her-standing-there/">exchange student</a> <em>(Sch√ºler)</em> in Minnesota is totally beside the point!</p>

        Where and For Whom to Vote
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Feb 2016</span>

    <p>Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Rogers">Will Rogers</a>, I am proud to not be a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.</p>

<p>And true to that spirit, as a Democrat living outside the United States, for the current presidential campaign I not only have to decide for whom to vote, but also where. (For my foreign readers following the US election, yes the process is complicated, and my description will make the impression that it is even more complicated. That is deliberate on my part.)</p>

<p>I can vote (in my last state of residence) in the Arizona presidential primary on March 22 (which, by the way, is not a primary but instead a <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/elections/voting-election/election-information">presidential preference election</a>, since the actual primary for state and local candidates is in August). However, the Democrats have an organization for Democrats living abroad (called, appropriately enough, <a href="http://www.democratsabroad.org/">Democrats Abroad</a>) which is entitled to send delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Eight of those delegates are superdelegates, beholden to no one but themselves, but thirteen delegates are pledged. And to choose those pledged delegates, they hold the <a href="http://www.democratsabroad.org/the_global_presidential_primary_is_now_vote">Democrats Abroad Global Presidential Primary</a>.</p>

<p>And just like in an official presidential primary (or preference election), I can even go to a real polling place to vote. In Hamburg! On March 5! At the <a href="http://www.democratsabroad.org/848/hamburg_global_presidential_primary">Friedrich Ebert Stiftung on Rathausmarkt!</a> (hold on, are we in cahoots with the German SPD on this?) Or at a number of <a href="http://www.democratsabroad.org/bseebach/democrats_abroad_germany_global_primary_locations">other locations in Germany</a>, or even <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/democratsabroad/pages/4823/attachments/original/1454667653/VotingCenters2016.pdf">around the world</a>. If wasn‚Äôt already a member of Democrats Abroad, I could join on-site at the polling place. If I couldn‚Äôt make it to a polling place, I could vote remotely, by email, fax or snail mail.</p>

<p>So while I could vote in my former home state of Arizona, it makes more sense for me to vote in the global primary, since we Americans abroad have unique issues for our candidates to be aware of (like <a href="http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/ustaxes.html">taxation</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act">FATCA</a>, and taxation).</p>

<p>So now I know where I will vote. Now I just have to decide for whom.</p>

<p>(In all fairness, there is also an organization for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/republicansoverseas/">Republicans abroad</a>, but you guys don‚Äôt get a primary. You‚Äôre not even officially part of the Republican party. Sorry.)</p>
