    <p>My gmail address is fairly generic, and apparently there are other people who would like to be PapaScott but can’t. So I get a fair amount of mail intended for other PapaScotts, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>confirmation for my tee time at a golf club in Pennsylvania</li>
  <li>notice of automatic deposit of my salary from the State of Tennessee</li>
  <li>my reservation for one week at a mobile home park in Georgia</li>
  <li>advertising from a car dealer in Argentina</li>
  <li>an appeal in French to donate (or sell, I can’t tell) my blood plasma to a clinic in Paris</li>
  <li>invitation of regular lunches of ex-military folks from a bellsouth in Tennessee</li>
  <li>regular notices of transactions (with scans of receipts) from my Well Fargo bank account in Georgia</li>
</ul>

<p>And I’m not even looking in my spam folder. I have enough keeping track of my own schedule without having to worry items for total strangers!</p>

    <p>So, yeah, I figured out how to use <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" title="Travis CI - Test and Deploy Your Code with Confidence">Travis CI</a> to <a href="http://pauldambra.github.io/using-travis-to-build-jekyll.html" title="Using Travis CI to build a Jekyll site">build my Jekyll blog</a> and push it to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="Websites for you and your projects">GitHub Pages</a>, and figured that I would actually write something for it to build rather than just fiddle with scripts and yaml files in the background.</p>

<p>Last fall we converted our restaurant in Dibbersen into a <a href="/archives/2016/11/07/the-future-is-now/">Restaurant of the Future</a>. Now we’ve remodeled our Hamburg, Winsener Straße restaurant so now we have doubled the future!</p>

<p>The lobby here has a more urban theme that fits our gritty part of Hamburg. I was worried it would be too dark, but the spots of color make it look brighter live than it appears in the photos.</p>

<p>It of course has all the innovations in Dibbersen, plus we now serve “Barista Quality” coffee at the front counter, meaning that the espresso drinks are made with the <a href="http://www.wmf-espresso.de/index_en.php#coffee-machine-section">portafilter machine</a> in McCafé.</p>

<p>With all this future we need to take time to catch our breaths. Our 3rd drive-thru restaurant on the Autobahn A1 at Rade will join the future in early 2018.</p>

        The Future Is Now
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2016</span>

    <p>We were closed 11 days for construction, but now our restaurant in Dibbersen has been opened for 3 days as a “Restaurant of the Future” and so far we are very happy with it!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/rdz-kiosks-061116.jpg" alt="" width="300" class="alignright" /> The first thing you notice as a guest is the brighter, more spacious lobby, as well as the self-service terminals, or kiosks. There you can enter your order and pay by either card or cash. Of course you can still go to the cashier and verbally give your order just as before.</p>

<p>The second thing you notice is that the cashier does not then go to assemble your order. There is a separate station for that, and you can either go there to pick up your order, or you can choose table service. You pick up a chip, find a table, and thanks to the magic of bluetooth we can find your table and bring your order to you.</p>

<p>The third thing you notice is that all burgers are made fresh to order. This “Made For You” system has been running for years in the US, but is new in Germany. The heated bin<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> where products could be kept for 10 minutes is now history. Our products are now made one at time instead of an entire tray at a time.</p>

<p>We were wondering how quickly we could adjust to the new system, but the first 3 days went very well. The kitchen is more organized and less hectic, and even it gets full we can recover quite quickly. In service our people enjoy that they now have time and opportunity to talk to our guests, and with our new look and new system they have plenty to talk about.</p>

<p>And even I learned enough about the new system that I can help out in the kitchen without messing everything up. :-)</p>

      <p>Funny how in US English a bin is where you put things to keep, but in UK English a bin is where you put things to throw away.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
