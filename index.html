    <p>On this All Saints’ Day we are happy and proud to announce that we are expecting!</p>

<p>Wait, no, that’s not right… damn you auto-correct, we’re too old for that. No, we are happy and proud to announce that we are <em>expanding</em>, in Hamburg-Harburg!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/phxarc-011116.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>On December 1st we will be purchasing the existing McDonald’s restaurants in Phoenix Center and Harburg Arcaden. They are so-called satellites, located in shopping centers with a limited menu and low volume (about 1/3 the sales of a free-standing restaurant).</p>

<p>We already own the Marktkauf Center satellite in Harburg, and all three stores are just a couple hundred meters apart. Our store manager there will now have her hands full with triplets!</p>

<p>And as we are right now converting our restaurant in Dibbersen to Restaurant of the Future (re-opening on Friday!) with Winsener Straße to follow in February, Frauke and I have our hands full too! :-)</p>

    <p>It took 10 years to build and is 10 times over budget, but the Hamburg’s new concert hall <a href="https://www.elbphilharmonie.de/en/elbphilharmonie">Elbphilharmonie</a> in the HafenCity is complete. The first concert is in January, but the builders handed it over to the city today.</p>

        The Stupid Majority
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Sep 2016</span>

    <p>This election is a good reminder of the basic principles of democracy: stupid people vote. Not only that, any democracy is ruled by a stupid majority.</p>

<p>Think about it. If you believe that you are of above-average intelligence, and who of us doesn’t, then by definition there is a majority of voters more stupid than you. And since stupid people generally don’t recognize their own stupidity, almost every one of us is faced with a stupid majority.</p>

<p>However, if you are stupid, and you know it, you can rest assured that there is a smart majority out there to make the decisions for you.</p>

<p>But the average person, of average intelligence, the average person has a great responsibility. They have the deciding vote. They decide whether the majority is smart or stupid. Our fate rests in their hands. May they choose wisely!</p>

<p>But they can’t. They are only of average intelligence.</p>

<p>So we are doomed to be ruled by a stupid majority. But that is not altogether a bad thing. All the political systems where only smart people make decisions have failed very badly. It is the stupid people who save us from ourselves.</p>

<p>(And I bet you thought a post with this title would be about Trump supporters. Or Clinton supporters. Fooled you!)</p>

    <p><a href="http://scripting.com/images/nyTimesHomeBombing7AM2.gif"><img src="/assets/nyt-110916.gif" alt="New York Times Screenshot 9-11-2001 via scripting.com " /></a></p>

<p>This screenshot from <a href="http://scripting.com/images/nyTimesHomeBombing7AM2.gif">scripting.com</a> is pretty much how I first learned the the 9/11 attacks. A low-res picture on a news website from my office in Hamburg. 3 in the afternoon. The next day I was able to put my <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/">thoughts into words</a>. More or less.</p>

<p>And next day came the headline in the Hamburg newspaper <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/13/were-in-this-together/">“Americans! We are with you!”</a>, and at the same time, the first clue that the attackers came from Hamburg. All I knew then was that my country and world would never be the same again. I was far away, and grateful for the internet where I could at least try to fathom how the country I had left a few years before was changing. Without me.</p>

<p>And today. My son who <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/16/sunday-at-home/">was an 1 year old then</a> is now 16, nearly an adult. My country started two wars in revenge that solved nothing, made everything worse, and haven’t really yet ended. Mission not accomplished. The current round of politics and presidential candidates don’t seem to offer much hope of any improvement.</p>

<p>So I think I’ll just listen to <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/albums/the-rising">The Rising</a> a couple times through to remind of me of how I felt and how things could have become better. But didn’t.</p>
