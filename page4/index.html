    <p>Today the Bundestag <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2013/45287063_kw24_gedenkveranstaltung_17_juni/index.html" title="bundestag.de: Gedenkveranstaltung zum 17. Juni 1953">commemorated</a> the 60th anniversary of the June 17th workers' uprising in East Germany in 1953. President Gauck spoke, linking the uprising then with the struggles for freedom throughout the world today, but the ceremony has merited only a brief mention in the German media. <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/18/heros-without-glory/" title="Heros without Glory">Ten years ago</a> I blogged about a documentary on the uprising which impresses me even today, particularly this photo.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://heldenohneruhm.de/">Helden ohne Ruhm</a> is a fascinating documentary of the 1953 uprising shown in ARD last night. It features interviews with demonstrators, VoPos, Soviet soldiers, and widows. It's being rerun tonight (RBB) and tomorrow (SWR) if you missed it. The photo is from newly discovered footage from Leipzig. The girl holding the sign was imprisoned until 1962.</p></blockquote>

    <span class="post-date">20 May 2013</span>

    <p>Since my <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2013/04/02/back-to-the-grind/">last fitness post</a> I've been progressing at making progress. </p>
<p>With a 5K run at the local <a href="http://www.buchholzerstadtlauf.de/">Stadtlauf</a> in June as a goal, I started running every other day following the run/walk program in <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B006OH9ENM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B006OH9ENM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=papascott-21">The Beginning Runner's Handbook</a>. That program is actually for a 10K, so the 5K at the Stadtlauf should be a piece of cake (although it's on asphalt and might be hot), right? The program calls for 3 runs a week, however I'm cheating a bit by sticking to every other day. As a result I'm already on Week 9.</p>
<p>I actually did the 5K at the Stadtlauf in 2010, but I didn't train sufficiently or correctly and <s>nearly died</s> was very sore the following week. My run yesterday was 55 minutes (with 3 1-minute walking breaks) and nearly 7K and I felt fine (slow pace with pulse in the 130s the entire time). The Stadtlauf should go just fine. And the 10K training won't go to waste, I'm intending to keep it up for the <a href="http://volkslauf.vfl-jesteburg.de/">Volkslauf in Jesteburg</a> in September (through woods in fall weather).</p>
<p>On the days I don't run I've been working out at the fitness center, so except for one day last week when I hurt my foot I've been doing fitness everyday for 8 weeks, since the week before Easter. And I have the results to show for it. I've lost a further 3 kg in the meantime, my weight is at 90.x (sounds like a radio station frequency), and my body fat is down too. My goals are 89.x by the end of June and 84.x by the end of September.  </p>
<p>This was also a test of <a href="http://fargo.io/">fargo.io</a> for posting to WordPress. (Note: to separate paragraphs you seem to need blank line directly after each one.)  I promise my next post will be about something more interesting than my improving fitness. </p>

        Salt of the Earth
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2013</span>

    <p>One of the cool things about 30 years of marriage (yes, it's going to be THIRTY YEARS this September) is that it's still possible after all that time to discover minuscule areas where you have irreconcilable differences. Or maybe "re-discover" is the better word, since for all we know we already knew all the things that annoy us about our partner but had conveniently forgotten them.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, salt. My mother is a health-conscious nurse, so even in the '70s when I was growing up we didn't eat a lot of salt. She always cooked with a herbal mixture to replace salt. I never got in the habit of adding salt at the table, and don't think of a salt shaker as an essential piece of cutlery.</p>
<p>My wife, on the other hand, will salt everything, often without tasting it first (especially if I have cooked it). She gets nervous if she sits at the table and there is not a salt shaker within reach. We sometimes have 3 or 4 salt shakers on the table at one time, since she often brings one to the table herself to make sure there's one there. And by my observation, her use of salt is moderate compared to some in her family and in Germany in general. I sometimes think that the heavy use of salt can so deaden the taste buds that one forgets food can have taste other than salt.</p>
<p>So when my nutrition class mentioned that cutting down on salt was not only healthy, but good for weight loss, I had no problems putting that into effect for myself. It however opened up a new source of conflict. I would cook a healthy dish without salt, my wife would grimace and reach for the salt shaker, I would roll my eyes, and our entertainment was guaranteed for the rest of the meal.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/gefro-040413.png" alt="Gefro DiÃ¤twurze" class="alignright" />Some peace has been restored to our household through the use of a salt substitute (which, strangely enough, is <a href="http://www.myline24.de/shop/essen-trinken/gefro-produktwelt/gefro-di%C3%A4tw%C3%BCrze-und-di%C3%A4tsuppe">sold</a> by the publisher of the nutrition class). It's based on potassium chloride, and tastes something like chicken soup. </p>
<p>It doesn't work that well at the table, though. The last time my wife asked me to pass the salt (which I had conveniently placed at the opposite end of the table from her), I instead handed her a newspaper article with the headline <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/ratgeber/wissen/article114765123/Millionen-Tote-durch-zu-hohen-Salzkonsum.html">"Millions of deaths from excessive salt consumption"</a>. Just my way of saying I love you, honey! (And after she threw the newspaper in my face, I handed her the salt.)</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2013</span>

    <p>Forgive me, internet, for I have sinned. It has been over 3 months since my last blog post.</p>
<p>And about the time of that last blog post I noticed that my weight and fitness were both leaving much to be desired. (I'm sure my wife noticed long before I did, and I'm sure she tried to let me know about it, and I'm even more sure I did my best to ignore her.) My weight was brushing up to triple-figures in kilograms (that's 220 pounds in dog years), and that was my wake-up call.</p>
<p>For the past couple of months I've been trying to put myself first as far as diet and exercise go. Instead of just thinking about going to the gym, I actually went to the gym three times a week. As motivation I bought a Spotify subscription for my cell phone and a set of <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/backbeat-go">Plantronics BackBeat Go</a> wireless sport headphones (as <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/013489.html">recommended by vowe</a>â¦ with gadgets you can do much worse than to buy <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/013739.html">what vowe keeps</a>).</p>
<p>I also retook the <a href="http://www.myline24.de/">MyLine</a> nutrition course at our gym. Having taken it once before, it all sounded familiar and I was able to take more of it to heart than the first time. The first change they recommend is to eat 5 times a day. That's not as easy as it sounds. Avoiding alcohol is also a challenge. :-)</p>
<p>But between the workouts and the nutrition and the positive motivation I was able to see results after two months. 6 kilos lost. Body fat reduced by nearly 3 percentage points. Waist and hips 3 cm smaller. Not bad for a guy who just turned 51.</p>
<p>If you're doing the math, you'll know my weight is not yet ideal. (To help you calculate BMI, my height is 174 cm. As my trainer said, if I were 15 cm taller my weight would be ideal.) So'll I'll be sticking with the program for another 3 months.</p>
<p>As it turned out, my next goal has been handed to me on a silver platter. Our business co-sponsors the local "<a href="http://www.buchholzerstadtlauf.de/">Stadtlauf</a>" (city run) in June, and the organizer told (not asked) my wife, "and your husband will run 5K this time". I'll take that as a challenge.</p>

        More Blessed to Give
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2012</span>

    <p>I'm not a particularly materialistic person. It's said that it is more blessed to give than to receive. If that's the case, then I had a particularly blessed Christmas. I've been blessed by a ratio of approximately 10 to 1.</p>
<p>A part of this is due to the arrangement that my in-laws have with one another, to not arrange gifts among the adults, but only for the nieces and nephews and then with a strict price limit. In this arrangement everything is systematic and pre-arranged without any risk of surprise or forethought. The suggested gifts are specified to the last detail, usually accompanied by a ISBN number or an Amazon link. Those who have no specific wishes simply wish for iTunes gift cards. Larger suggestions can be combined among families or with Oma, with a complicated accounting of how the costs are shared and who pays whom for what.</p>
<p>As you may know, our gift for Christopher this was a somewhat expensive musical instrument, a set of small pipes imported from Canada. My idea was that the in-laws could give a share of the instrument as their gift to Christopher: the set budget for Christmas and birthday would cover one-twelfth of the cost. I assumed this would be entered into the post-Christmas cost-of-gift accounting. But for some reason, perhaps because the small pipes did not have an item number at Amazon, the in-laws had all instead prepared envelopes with cash for Christopher. That was somewhat awkward as he already had gotten the pipes on Christmas Eve, so I had to snatch the cash from the cards. One of them had even pasted the bills with double-sides sticky pads to the card, which could only be removed with 10 minutes elbow grease and nail polish.</p>
<p>For my gifts within the family I did my best to break the rules about avoiding surprise and forethought. For Christopher I found a couple of his favorite US groceries (Honey-Nut Cheerios!), for my wife some Brazilian jewelry and her specific wish for a bag for eyeglasses on her running belt (she lost a pair in the woods a couple of months ago; if you see a wild boar wearing bifocals you know who they belong to). For both I found a print of a hand-drawn map of London to remember our recent trip.</p>
<p>I'll admit I'm being selective about counting gifts received. I'm not counting cash from the US (saves on shipping and I can pick out what I want), and I'm also not counting the colored sugar-and-spice calendar given to both my wife and me. I will also admit that the 50-year-old male is not the easiest to pick out presents for. I probably wouldn't know what to get myself.</p>
<p>In the end my best and only present is a blue terry-cloth bathrobe. I already had a blue terry-cloth bathrobe, but it was 10 years old and my wife decided it was too ragged to look at anymore. The new robe is longer but not as warm. It will also be a constant reminder of how blessed I was this Christmas.</p>
