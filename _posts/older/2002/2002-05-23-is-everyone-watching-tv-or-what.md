<p>Is it just me, or <a href="http://www.vfth.com/2002/05/22">have</a> an <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/05/22#l97392e34ce3750d56911ff460e24ec93">awful</a> lot <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/enter/tv/2002/2002-05-21-buffy.htm">of</a> people <a href="http://timesshadow.editthispage.com/2002/05/22">noted</a> the season (or grande) finales of various TV series in their blogs the past few days? </p>
<p>Maybe we hang out with the wrong crowd, but TV series are not a topic of conversion for us or anyone we know. Our schedules are so chaotic, we couldn't manage to follow a series even if we wanted to. I guess that's called real life.</p>
<p>(Although it should be noted that we got a new 82 cm 16:9 TV last week, just so the TV we do watch can be seen clearly from across the room.)</p>
