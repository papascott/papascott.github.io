<p>We interrupt the election campaign for a natural disaster. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/08/15/europe.floods/index.html">CNN.com - Dresden evacuated as waters rise</a>. Over 100,000 have been evacuated along the Elbe and Mulde in Saxony, and damage has been estimated at several billion Euros. The investment made in rebuilding eastern Germany the past 12 years is being literally washed down the drain. The Elbe, of course, flows through Hamburg on its way to the North Sea. I haven't heard any estimates of what disruption or damage the waters could cause up here.</p>
