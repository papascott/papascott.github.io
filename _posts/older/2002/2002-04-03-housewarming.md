<p>Thanks for <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/2002/03/31">the</a> <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20020402">housewarming</a> <a href="http://www.vfth.com/2002/04/02">greetings</a>, folks. Nothing like a little bread and salt to make a new place feel like home. Hal also wins the award for first post, er actually <a href="/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1678">first comment</a>. </p>
<p>The design is still the MT default, all CSS and standards-conformant. I'm working on implementing the happy stripes from the old design in CSS, if for nothing else to look a little different from all the other MT sites.</p>
<p>And thanks again to <a href="http://www.userland.com">UserLand</a> for hosting PapaScott on Manila for over 2 years, and best of luck with all the new ventures that seem to be on the horizon.</p>
