<p>It's probably a huge case of hubris on my part, but I've adopted the <a href="http://www.chaos.org.uk/~pdh/homilies/" title="real men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it ;)">Linus Torvalds 'backups are for wimps' attitude</a> and started a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/papascott/" title="SourceForge.net: Project Info - PapaScott">SourceForge project</a> for my weblogging stuff. I mostly want to use their CVS to keep track of my personal, er, ehancements to <a href="http://www.cafelog.com">b2</a>, but I can keep other miscellaneous scripts there too, like my scripts to <a href="/2002/03/31">convert Manila to XML to Movable Type</a>.</p>
