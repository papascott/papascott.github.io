<p>Der Schockwellenreiter <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/09/03.html#a7586">comments</a> on <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk/">City Desk</a> (freely translated into American English, the only language Der Schockwellenreiter does not endorse  :-) </p>
<p>"[ CMS ]:  And if one follows the link to City Desk, one discovers an interesting content management system (on the Desktop) similar to Radio Userland, with several new ideas. Unfortunately it's only for Windows (it's based on Micro$ofts Jet engine).  And why they needed yet introduce yet another tag system ({ $. tag $ } instead of < % day % >) remains the secret of the programmer."</p>
<p>True enough, but you can put City Desk on the desktop of inexperienced PC users. And our <em>Tagesmutter</em> thinks it's <a href="http://www.tagesmuetter-vaeter.de/">wonderful</a>. I would have never <em>dreamt</em> of giving her <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a>.</p>
