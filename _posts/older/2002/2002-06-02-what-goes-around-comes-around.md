<p>Last Sunday I put in the <a href="/2002/05/27/index.php#001739">blogroll</a> script, which I adapted from a <a href="http://philringnalda.com/phpblogroll/">script</a> by Phil Ringnalda. After seeing me in <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org">Mark's</a> referrers, he was <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002219.php">reminded</a> of my link and that that his script was <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/001908.php">inspired</a> by my old article on <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$778">blogrolling with php alone</a> (which in turn was inspired by <a href="http://www.curry.com">Adam Curry</a> and his <a href="http://www.curry.com/discuss/msgReader$801#theBlogRollingMacro">blog rolling Frontier macro</a> (and who  I think originated the term 'blogrolling' ). Anyway, this post is just to further complicate the tangled web of links, and to remind me that I, too, need a linkback script of some sort.</p>
