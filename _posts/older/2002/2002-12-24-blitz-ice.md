<p>Severe freezing rain is mucking up the works around here for Christmas. We've had a 1 cm layer of ice covering everything all day long here, and tomorrow promises to be more of the same. We'll see if the whole family can make it in for the big goose feast. But Christopher's happy. He's already scored a ton of train gear, and there's more coming tomorrow, and again on his birthday.</p>
