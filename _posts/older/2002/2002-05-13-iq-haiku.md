<p>Andrea <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2002/05/12">mentioned</a> the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/testthenation/">BBC Test the Nation IQ test</a>, although I find it strange to assume that intelligent people would watch TV to test their intelligence. </p>
<p>And I used to belong to <a href="http://www.mensa.org">Mensa</a>. Then I got kicked out for having Alzheimer's... er, I mean I let my membership lapse. I had only joined (based on my SAT scores) to show up my high school classmates. It worked, too.</p>
