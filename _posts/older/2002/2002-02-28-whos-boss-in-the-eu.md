<p>Heard on <a href="http://www.ndr4.de">NDR4</a>: The EU Commission is suing the EU Council of Ministers for overturning a Commission decision. The decision (involving pork subsidies in Portugal) was rather minor, but was overturned for purely politcal reasons.<br />
It's interesting in light of the ministers overturning the budget warning for Germany, and recent comments by European politicians that the Commission has become too powerful and that more European decision-making should be made at the national and regional level.<br />
It's also interesting that I cannot find a single web link to this story.</p>
