<p>My <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100464/2002/01/15.html">Radio is still on</a>, if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>We've now got a time and a place in Las Vegas: Sunday 21 April though Friday 26 April, Hotel <a href="http://www.parislasvegas.com">Paris Las Vegas</a>. The hotel was chosen for us. <i>And yes, we'd love to meet up with <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/">Hal and family!</a></i></p>
<p>Christopher and I have had our last Monday alone together for a while. I simply cannot put in a full day's work at home alone with an active two-year-old. We'll be sending him to day care for at least part of the day starting next week.</p>
<p>German bureaucracy moves slowly, which can be advantageous at times. We were deliberately slow sending in our 2000 tax return to the local Finanzamt, knowing we'd owe a medium size chunk. We finally got the statement just before we left on vacation in December, as well as a request for some additional paperwork. We "forgot", and today got a polite reminder. But they still haven't booked anything from our bank account.</p>
