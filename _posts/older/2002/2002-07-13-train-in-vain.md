<p>To say the Christopher is obsessed by trains would be a gross understatement. So today while Mama was on the road working (see <a href="/2002/07/13/1805.php#001805">below</a>), he and I took the S-Bahn to Hamburg and had lunch at <a href="http://www.bahnhof-hamburg.de/wandelhalle.html">Hauptbahnhof</a> (with a window seat to the platforms below). I was Christopher's hero of the day, or at least for the hour.</p>
<p>Tomorrow if the weather is good we'll go to Hamburg's zoo <a href="http://www.hagenbeck.de/"> Tierpark Hagenbeck</a>. Christopher can name most of the classic zoo animals, so he should have a good time.<br />
 <b>Update:</b> We decided to stay home, due to drizzle and lack of energy. We'll go some other time.</p>
