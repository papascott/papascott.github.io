This was in 1998, before they had trained in Afghanistan or had taken any flying lessons. They decided that security at the consulate was too tight, though, and dropped their plans, all this according to Mohammed Haydar Zammar, being held in Syria. Spiegel also has a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,grossbild-220889-220976,00.html">nice picture of the consulate</a>. That's the same armoured vehicle that accompanied Christopher and me last month when we applied for his passport.</p>
