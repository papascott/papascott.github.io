<p>Our youngest cat, Karl-Heinz, died in his sleep this morning. He was 16 years old. He was <em>Mama's</em> cat, like <a href="/2001/10/11/1561.html">Helga</a> was <em>my</em> cat, and <a href="/2000/01/17/1201.html">Mausi</a> is <em>our</em> cat. I thought he was selfish and manipulative, even for a cat. He was cute and he knew it, and he knew how to use it. He was shy and didn't come out for company, but was the immediate favorite of everyone who met him.</p>
<p>He came from a troubled home in Minneapolis. His name when we got him was 'Twisted Sister', and my first experience when we tried to take him home was that he bit me, through my hand, so hard that I fainted. When we finally got him home, he hid in our basement for weeks. It took literally years for his personality to become somewhat normal.</p>
