<p>At work I evaluated <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/office/">CodeWeavers CrossOver Office</a>, a package of the Wine Windows emulation for Linux that supports Microsoft Office and the Lotus Notes Client. I found that it's not quite the cats meow, not yet, and I recommended that we wait for an update with bugfixes and then try it again. Display of fonts (rather important for Office documents) just isn't quite good enough yet for daily use on a relatively current machine (Mandrake 8,1), and I couldn't get fonts to display right at all on an older installation (Mandrake 7.x) . It's promising, and I'll keep an eye on it, even if it's not quite usable yet.</p>
