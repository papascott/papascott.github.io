<p>Today my employer announced further cost cutting measures effective January 1, despite the voluntary cuts in vacation and pay we agreed to last month. We are closing the development center in Leipzig, laying off all 22 employees and dropping our mobile finance and HBCI lines that were developed there, and laying off an additional 5 employees in Hamburg.  We'll be down to 110 employees, less than half that of two years ago, when we had offices in Singapore, New York, and Johannesburg. Now we have just Hamburg. My job is safe for now. We'll see in 6 months.</p>
