<p>Mama called. She's catching the last flight from Munich to Hamburg, and won't be home until close to midnight. She said the airport was much emptier than usual. Christopher tried to distract her  by describing our visit with his granparents to the <a href="http://www.serengeti-park.com/">Serengeti Park</a> yesterday. 'Monkey bus. Giraffe. Tiger. Lion. Train. Boat. Elephant. Airplane. Pizza.' Wait, pizza is what we had for supper tonight. And 'monkey bus' means the monkeys crawled all over the moving tour bus, reaching in the windows for fruit that the driver had passed around to the passengers.</p>
