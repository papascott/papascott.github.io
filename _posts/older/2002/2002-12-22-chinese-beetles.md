<p><a title="Better Living Through Software" href="http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/2002/12/22.html#a264">Josh Allen</a> mentions all the German cars he noticed when visiting China, and <a title="The Scobleizer Weblog" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2002/12/22.html#a1928">Scoble</a> comments on it as well. I'm no Asian business expert, but I do pay attention to the news, and can point out a few random facts.</p>
<p>The <a title="Ostasiatischer Verein e.V." href="http://www.oav.de/index.php3?t=e">German Asia-Pacific Business Association</a> is based in Hamburg and is extremely active developing business contacts in China and elsewhere in Asia. It was founded in 1900. Business relations with China are not a new thing in Germany.</p>
<p>In 1984 Volkswagen signed a 50% 25-year joint venture with China. It was this year <a href="http://www.canadiandriver.com/news/020415-2.htm">extended</a> for an additional 20 years. I believe that the US Big 3 thought that 50% was too little control to be successful.</p>
<p>Hamburg, Germany's largest port, is a sister city with Shanghai, China's largest port. The mayor visits Shanghai annually, with a large business delegation. 230 Chinese firms are located in Hamburg.</p>
<p>In the end, I think German business is successful in China because, at least in regards to China,  Germans put business before politics. I don't think Americans would be able to do that.</p>
