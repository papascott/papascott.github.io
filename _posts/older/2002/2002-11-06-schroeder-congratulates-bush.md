<p>An <a href="http://www.instapundit.com/archives/005336.php#005336">email to Glenn Reynolds</a> asks "I wonder if German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has placed a congratulatory call to President Bush yet?". Actually, according to Spiegel Online, he <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,221621,00.html" title="Spiegel Online: Schröder will Bush gratulieren - trotz allem">has</a>. Or at least he intends to. I guess the real question is, will President Bush bother to pick up the phone when he sees who is calling? </p>
<p><b>Update</b> Here's a quick English summary of the Spiegel article: <b>Schröder wants to congratulate Bush, in spite of everything.</b> Schröder's press secretary announced that Schröder wanted to congratulate Bush as soon as the final results are in. He didn't want to speculate whether Bush would belatedly congratulate Schröder on his victory in September. "Of course the Chancellor will congratulate the President in the appropriate way." The Foreign Office explained that the Republican victory would have no effect on relations with the US.</p>
