<p>The final result is not yet final. We'll have to wait for the count of 'overhang representitives', the number of directly elected representives over the proportion of the total vote. They should increase the SPD faction by up to 5 seats, according to ZDF, giving Red/Green the majority, but we won't know for sure until 3 am when all districts have been counted. If you understand the electoral college in the US, then I'm the overhang reps will be completely clear. Good night!.</p>
