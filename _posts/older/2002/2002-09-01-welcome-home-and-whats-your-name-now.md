<p>Andrea and Andr√© are <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2002/09/01">back home</a> after an <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2002/08/20">eventful</a> trip to the American Southwest. Now, Mama and I had to go through a lot of trouble to have our Minnesota marriage certificate recognized here in Germany (the official in Kiel insisted that our certificate was improperly numbered). Forgive my curiosity, but are you going to have the American marriage recognized here, or are you going to have German ceremony at a <em>Standesamt</em>? Will a German civil servent have to determine whether <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/">Hal Rager</a> is really entitled to perform a wedding ceremony?</p>
<p>And, another question, do either of you now have a hyphenated last name? What should we be calling you two now?</p>
