<p><a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/06/19.html#a6154">Das Kriegsbeil ist begraben</a>. Good news for German bloggers, and especially for Jörg Kantel (aka Der Schockwellenreiter). After a phone call between Jörg and a representitive of the Suhrkamp Verlag, the cease-and-dissist letter has been withdrawn, including the demand for legal fees. The Kantels are now free to spend the &euro;1200 as they wish... for example, on their dog Zebu.</p>
<p>The issue of which links are legal in Germany and which are not is still open. There are previous cases of FTPExplorer/SelfHTML and the Hamburg ruling requiring disclaimers for outside links are not particularly comforting. But American bloggers  have similar problems, for example  National Public Radio  requiring <a href="http://www.vfth.com/2002/06/19#NDozMzoyNSBBTQdbdb">permisssion</a> for links.</p>
