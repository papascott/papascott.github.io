<p>View from an Iowa Homestead: <a href="http://iowa.weblogger.com/2002/08/09">Setting up PHP and MySQL on OS X</a>. Seems awfully difficult to me, compared with 'portinstall mod_php4 mysql-server" on FreeBSD (or apt-get under Debian), but of course getting to the point where you can type 'portinstall whatever' is the tricky part. (And I won't even mention rpm-based Linux distributions.)</p>
