<p><a href="http://www.heiferman.com/mcd/">i was a 20-something dethroned dotcom ceo that went to work the counter at  mcdonald's</a>. And it wasn't a publicity stunt or a joke. (Via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100131/">William Stratas' Weblog</a>)</p>
<p>I have a theory about Christopher's babbling. He's noticed that Mama and Papa each have their own language, so he has decided that he needs his own language too. I deciphered one of his words today: 'daddle' means pacifier. When he says it, it usually means he's looking for it.</p>
<p>I was able to flip my page, even though yesterday's page title was "empty". So much for the bug test.</p>
<p>"When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, 'Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are <a href="http://www.mecca.org/~crights/dream.html">free at last</a>!'"</p>
