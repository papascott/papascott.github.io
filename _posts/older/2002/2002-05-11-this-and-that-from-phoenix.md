<p>Our dream is to return to the Southwest someday, but it won't be anytime soon. Mama's employer restructured in the US last year, and no longer has a regional office in Phoenix (merging with Denver). Since Mama is a Regional Manager, moving to Phoenix via her employer is out (Denver is <b>not</b> an acceptable alternative). But we looked at a nice abobe-style townhouse anyway, just for fun.</p>
<p>We stayed with Mama's old boss, who still has a job but no longer an office (see above). Instead she has a lot of lonely travel and is somewhat jaded on the company. Our other friend has worked for 3 different oil/convenience store companies in the past year without changing her desk. But she's happy. We all went to a D-Backs game our last night. We had fun, and they won.</p>
<p>LAX sucks for catching connections, especially with a stroller. To switch terminals, you have to go outside and wait for a crowded non-accessable bus. FRA was almost as bad; no bus, but a maze of twisty tunnels, all alike. AMS or even KEF in Iceland are much nicer. Our domestic flights with America West, however, went very well, despite our <a href="/2002/03/25">fears before booking</a>.</p>
<p>Should I be worried that it is now past noon, and Christopher is <b>still</b> sleeping?</p>
