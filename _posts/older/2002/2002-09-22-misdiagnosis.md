<p>Last night, Christopher complained about his ear again and couldn't sleep. We began to suspect that he actually didn't fall the other night, but instead has an ear infection. Mama took him to the emergency room in Buchholz, and sure enough, an ear infection it is. It was tough to notice because he is in such a good mood, and has no fever. The doctor put him on the 10-day antibiotics / paracetomol / mucus dissolver trip. Now we just have to convince him to settle down for a few days.</p>
