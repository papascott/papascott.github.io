<p>The Nikon repair shop cleverly sent an estimate at the upper limit of what we were willing to pay to have our CoolPix fix, so we accepted it and the camera will be ready... sometime. If we had the camera, I could show you Christopher <i>creatively</i> putting together the tracks for his <a href="http://www.target.com/common/catalog/product.jhtml?prodid=38879">wooden train</a> in twisted ways not exactly intended by the manufacturer. When he twists too much, we do have an ample supply of glue. He still needs me to put in the bridge, though.</p>
