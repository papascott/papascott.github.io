<p>The Nando Times: <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com/world/story/281296p-2535879c.html">NYC firefighters get warm welcome in Germany</a> I'm not in the mood for hard news today, so how about some good news instead. The weather there is, well, brisk: "A few ventured out to the cold, windswept beach for a stroll."</p>
