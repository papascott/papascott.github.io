<p>Alwin writes about <a href="http://www.vfth.com/2002/04/10#NTo0MTowOSBQTQdbdb">talkng about the Halocaust with his daughter</a>, finding it better to turn off the TV program that started the discussion. It reminded me of the <a href="http://www.bergenbelsen.de/index_E.htm">Memorial at Bergen-Belsen</a>, less than an hour's drive from us, which is so moving precisely because there is nothing to see. The camp was burnt down by the British just weeks after it was liberated. Today it's just a field with mounds, a couple dozen in all. Each mound is a mass grave. Each mound represents tens of thousands of victims. The last time we were there, it was a cloudy, gloomy day, and we could hear gunfire from nearby troops on exercise. Eerie.</p>
