<p>Christopher's favorite toy at the moment seems not to be a toy, but a CD player. He got a set of kids CDs from his Uncle Steve and family, and we 've left a portable player within reach in his room. He gets a kick out of turning it on and off and pushing the skip button to start a new song.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vfth.com/2002/01/08">Alwin</a> will be happy to know that yesterday, along with his U7, Christopher got caught up with his vaccinations. Next shot is planned for 2006.</p>
<p>To repeat what <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/2002/01/07">Wes</a> says, <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">the new iMac</a> looks nice. But can I get one without a monitor? I'd love to try out OS X, but not for <a href="http://www.apple.com/germanstore/">&euro;2000</a>. I was thinking of putting together a secondary PC f√ºr multimedia anyway, but my budget for that is closer to &euro;300, since I already have some of the parts.</p>
<p>Note to grandparents: The two missing <a href="http://www.littletikes.com/toyfinder/productsfull.asp?sku=0813">bus people</a> have been found. They were in the box with the <a href="http://www.target.com/common/catalog/product.jhtml?prodid=38879">train set</a>.</p>
