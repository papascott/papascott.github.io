<p>I noticed that Brent's weblogs <a href="http://inessential.com/">inessential.com</a> and <a href="http://ranchero.com/">ranchero.com</a> weren't showing up on my blogroll, and asked Brent whether he was still pinging weblogs.com. He replied that he's not (inadvertantly), and that weblogs.com may have outlived its usefulness anyway.</p>
<p>To paraphrase William Joel, 'you may be right'.  I'm finding a number of sites that I'd like to follow don't ping or ping irregularly, and that a number of pings are false alarms. But is maintaining local copies of 50 RSS feeds over dialup really a better alternative?</p>
<p>With all due respect to <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">desktop RSS readers</a>, I have too many desktops for that to be practical. The only thing my desktops have in common is Mozilla. For me it makes more sense to keep the feeds I want to follow at my hosting server. It doesn't bother me to have my feeds publicly accessible. I <em>want</em> people to know what I read. I don't want an <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">Amphetadesk</a>, I want an Amphetaserver!</p>
<p><a href="http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/">Martin</a> has put together an <a href="http://traumwind.server-wg.de/blog/magpie/index.php?url=http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/rss.php">RSS reader with PHP</a>, and that might be the direction I'll go.</p>
