<p><a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$1268"><img alt="Link to Hal and Scott in LV" src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/05/halandsmh.jpg" width="100" height="75" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/2002/05/11">Hal</a> has put up a picture of us from our evening a couple weeks ago. I was coming off two nights of chicken pox duty, and in this picture I was nearly as zoned out as Christopher. Luckily my parents were along, and they carried the conversation for the last hour. If you want to hear a good story when you meet Hal, ask him when Las Vegas was founded. You won't be disappointed. Bonus points if you ask about springs.</p>
