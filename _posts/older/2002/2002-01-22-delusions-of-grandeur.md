<p>Meanwhile, Ronald Barnabas Schill, Hamburg's ex-Judge Merciless and current Interior Senator,  seems to have delusions of national political grandeur. He's offering Edmund Stoiber to enter the Schill Party in the Bundestag elections as an ally to pick up votes from northern conservatives who might be unwilling to vote for a Bavarian. That's the rumor, anyway. The CSU is doing their best to ignore the supposed offer.</p>
