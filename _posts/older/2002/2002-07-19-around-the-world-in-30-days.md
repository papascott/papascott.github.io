<p>Mark Pilgrim has now <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/19.html#day_30_creating_an_accessibility_statement">completed</a> his series <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/30_days_to_a_more_accessible_weblog/index.html">30 days to a more accessible weblog</a>. I suspect, however, that like a Douglas Adams trilogy, there might be more to come. So when is the book coming out, Mark? (Actually I just wanted to be able to link to an episode before <a href="http://weblog.delacour.net/">Jonathon Delacour</a> had a chance. First post!)</p>
