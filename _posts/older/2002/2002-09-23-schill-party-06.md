<p>Translated from <a href="http://www.welt.de">Die Welt</a>: Hamburg - The Schill Party received ca. 4.4 percent of the vote in Hamburg (nationwide: ca. 0.6 percent). Thus the party failed to achieve its goal of eight percent. Party Founder Ronald Schill does not, however, want to give up his national political ambitions. 'In principle this is a disappointing result,' he admitted, but that it is 'no embarassment to have landed under five percent'.</p>
