<p>AP: <a href="http://www.expatica.com/germanymain.asp?pad=190,205,&amp;item_id=18772">Germany's highest court calls off hearings on banning far-right party</a>.  The government's application to ban the neo-Nazi NPD has been postponed by the court, as it cites statements by a party leader who was a government informant. The NPD ban is just a PR stunt - noone truly believes the ban would significantly affect neo-Nazi activity. But now the stunt has totally backfired, and Interior Minister Schily is in hot water.</p>
