<p><a href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2002_06.shtml#000499">Movable Type 2.2 released</a>. PapaScott has been running the beta version with the MySQL backend for the past two weeks. Nice to have the data so accessable. But the real mind bomb, as <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave</a> would say, is the TrackBack feature, which enables entries in your blog to be pinged by other blogs linking to it, and thus create a list of those links your entry. It will be like an Internet-wide comments feature, once people grok it and other blogging systems implement it as well.</p>
<p>It would be really nice if MT could ping both weblogs.com and blo.gs by default. But it should be easy enough to add a couple of lines to get that to work.</p>
<p>28 Jun: Let's see if trackback is working for the daily archive.</p>
