<p>I'll let others comment on the treatment of the detainees held by the US in Cuba. <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,178536,00.html">Spiegel Online</a> has an interesting article on the American reaction to the conditions in Cuba (see headline) and to the international criticism. It concludes (my translation): "The USA doesn't exactly suffer from modesty. It never tires of proclaiming itself to be world's best democracy,  with the world's finest constitution. It shouldn't be surprised when it is measured against its own words."</p>
