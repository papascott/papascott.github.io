<p>FAZ: <a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&amp;doc={46B7DD8B-428B-4BD1-B3BE-F32E715A6395}">Vote on Import of Stem Cells Wide Open</a> On certain issues, the Bundestag parties decide to drop party discipline and let the members vote on conscience. Previous such debates (abortion, moving the capital) have shown German democracy at its best.<br />
Being able to form consensus and make decisions on ethical issues (i.e. abortion, gun control) is something I find painfully lacking in US politics.<br />
<b>Update</b> The compromise solution, allowing only restricted import of embryo stem cells, was approved, rather than a total ban or the unrestricted import.</p>
