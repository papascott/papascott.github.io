<p>Here's Christopher with his Easter Rabbit he got from Oma. It's made of bread, so he's having it for breakfast.</p>
<p>Since we didn't get around to searching for Easter eggs yesterday, we did it this morning. Christopher didn't see the point of hard boiled eggs at first, but finding a chocolate bunny made the adventure worthwhile. We've still got 2 packages of Kinder chocolate that he got as presents for Easter. We'll have to try to parcel them out as slowly as we can.  </p>
<p>Otherwise, the weather was gorgeous. Christopher was able to spend the whole day outside. With Bobby Car races with neighbor Carolin, a bike ride to the playground, "helping" Mama in the garden, he kept busy all day too.</p>
<p>And in case anybody is wondering, Europe is already on Daylight Savings Time as of yesterday. My <a href="http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker">Blogtracker</a> is out of whack!</p>
