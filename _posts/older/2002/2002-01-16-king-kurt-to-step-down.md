<p>Not much interesting news today... just that Kurt Biedenkopf announced that he will <a href="http://www.expatica.com/germany.asp?pad=190,205,&amp;item_id=18517">resign as Prime Minister in Saxony in April</a>. He's been irrelevent for so long,  it wouldn't be worth noting except that it's a slow news day. It's ironic, though, that like his former rival Helmut Kohl, he stayed in office one term too long.</p>
