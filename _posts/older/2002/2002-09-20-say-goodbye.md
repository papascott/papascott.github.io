<p>I've been messing with my nav column. After reading how Jonathon Delacour was going to <a href="http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000698.html">say goodbye to useless calendars</a>, I was so inspired that I deleted my calendar on the spot. And if you look way at the bottom, I've added (using <a href="http://www.egm.at/weblog/entry.php?id=00679">this script</a>) some fake mail addresses as part of JÃ¶rg Kantel's <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/webdesign/spam.html">Stoppt Spam</a> campaign to muck up spam bots.</p>
