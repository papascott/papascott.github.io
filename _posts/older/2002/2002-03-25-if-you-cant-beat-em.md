<p>In my tries to produce XML files of this website, the obvious answer finally hit me this evening. If I'm trying to get a tool for Radio 7 to work, the thing to do is to download and install Radio 7. I've now got a folder of all the files I need. ;-)</p>

<p>Doc calls America West <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/03/23#americaWaste">"America Waste"</a> after an ill-fated check-in from LAX to Phoenix. I wanted us to take America West LAX-LAS-PHX-LAX next month. After flying 12 hours from Frankfurt with a 2-year-old, do we really want to endure a check-in from hell? But AmWest costs half as much as the competition, even cheaper than Southwest. Decisions, decisions.</p>
