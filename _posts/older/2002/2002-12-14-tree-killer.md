<p>I was hoping to have been able to tell the entire story of harvesting a Christmas tree from our front yard, but alas, our tree stand is too small, so we'll have to wait until Monday to bring the tree inside. </p>
<p>When we first moved out of the city, Mama used to always bring a small shovel along on our bike rides to "liberate" baby pine trees from the paths at the <a href="http://www.mu.niedersachsen.de/Aktuell/naturparke/heide.htm" title="Naturpark LÃ¼neburger Heide">nearby nature reserve</a>, where they would have been tramped to death by tourists, to be planted in our garden. This tree is the last of those liberated trees. It must be about 8 years old.</p>
