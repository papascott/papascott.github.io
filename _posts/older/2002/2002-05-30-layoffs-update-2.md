<p>It's been nearly two weeks since management dropped da bomb, and they still have not given an explanation for their actions, and the topic not even mentioned to stockholders at the annual shareholders meeting this week. There are a lot of rumours and speculation floating around the water cooler. The only thing that seems for sure is that a workers' council <i>(Betriebsrat)</i> will be formed.</p>
<p>However, a TV will be set up so those of us who are still working can watch  German World Cup matches during working hours.</p>
