<p>Today. we found that no, we weren't dreaming, indeed the layoffs were true, for reasons of cost-cutting, not communicated to the staff (I knew because our department talks to one another after hours) and chosen arbitrary (my department head was not informed, I'm sure he would have not chosen his most senior admin for the boot). They were not communicated in one-to-one meetings, as one would expect, but instead dropped anonymously into the employees' home mailboxes on Friday afternoon. And this is supposed to motivate us remaining employees to pull ourselves out of the crisis? Hardly. Stay-at-home fatherhood is looking better all the time. The mood is miserable.</p>
