<p>Unlike Mama, who spent her vacation reading mysteries, I got myself the two new PHP books from O'Reilly, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/progphp/">Programming PHP</a> and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/webdbapps/">Web Database Applications</a>. They are both worthwhile, although the Database book is more in tune with what I am doing, while Programming PHP is more of an introduction. For various reasons, PHP 4 is becoming my main tool at work (although perl still plays a big role). </p>
<p>I'm sure Mama had more fun with her reading, though.</p>
