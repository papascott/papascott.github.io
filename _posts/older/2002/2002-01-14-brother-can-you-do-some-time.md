<p><a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/contents/ha/news/lokales/html/140102/1214BENA0.HTM">Hamburger Abendblatt</a>: A pair of brothers made fools of Hamburg justice officials. The younger brother was a pimp sentenced to 2 years prison. His older brother was broke and offered to take his place. Prison officials didn't notice the switch for over 10 months, even though the brother in the cell was a head taller and 20 kg heavier than the brother that was convicted.</p>
