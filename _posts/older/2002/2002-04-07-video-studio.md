<p>We finally got our video camera back into action, after 1) getting it repaired (on warranty) after (I suspect) Christopher jammed the cassette mechanism, and 2) finding that a head cleaning cassette solved our playback quality problem. And I think I finally found a usable video editing software, <a href="http://www.ulead.com/vs/runme.htm">Ulead VideoStudio 6</a>. The demo has been very nice, much improved from version 4 that came with my FireWire card, and I think I'll end up buying it. So maybe we can finally start sending video CDs to Grandma and Grandpa, like we've been promising for months. </p>
<p>(Yes, I know I could render mpegs and burn video CDs with Linux, but I don't want to take the time to mess with that.)</p>
