<p>I've put Radio back on the shelf, but <a href="http://www.wiredfool.com/2002/01/16">Eric Soroos</a> explains how to get upstreaming to work with rsync/ssh, or indeed any command line tool (by enabling a backup, then writing a upstream callback that calls the tool). That's a lot simpler than I thought it would be. While he imagines the solution for OS X, I'm sure you could get it to work with <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> under Windows as well. But I don't have the time to pursue it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.papascott.de">papascott.de</a>: <a href="/2002/01/17/index.php#000091">9/11: A Brick In A Bedsheet</a>. "Visiting the States last month, it was quickly apparent that the effect of 9/11 on ordinary people was much deeper than I had imagined..." This is a long, somewhat personal post where I'm trying to make sense of things. It seems to fit in better at the other site. </p>
<p>I received the following mail from Switzerland:<br />
<i>Hi Scott<br />
We are looking for Katja. Could you please tell her to make a phone call to me ore to our mother (We don't have a new adress). Thanks.<br />
I wish you all the best for the new year.<br />
Claudia</i><br />
Except that we don't know a Katja, or a Claudia in Switzerland. At least we don't think we do. She might be a spammer trying to confirm my address. If you're reading this, Claudia, and we do truly know you, and you are not a spammer, could you please remind us of who you are? Thanks.</p>
