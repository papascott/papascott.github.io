<p>Pioneer Press: <a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/4368592.htm">Sen. Paul Wellstone killed in plane crash</a>. I was an active DFLer in my Minneapolis days, but left Minnesota before Wellstone was first elected. I never really knew him, and my voting home is now Arizona, but I thought it appropriate that my old home state had a senator more liberal than the other 99 put together.</p>
