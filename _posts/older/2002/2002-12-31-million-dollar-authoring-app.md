<p>I was at first confused by Mark Pilgrim's <a title="Pushing the envelope [dive into mark]" href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope">use of the cite tag</a>, but now that he has <a title="Million dollar markup [dive into mark]" href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/29.html#million_dollar_markup">clarified</a> that he's not doing it "for the children", but rather <a title="Tag soup of a new generation [dive into mark]" href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/30.html#the_tag_soup_of_a_new_generation">just for himself</a>, I can see the point. What I need is a million dollar authoring app so I can keep track of all those <a title="Couchblog: (X)HTML Attributes used!" href="http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2002/12/xhtml_attributes_used.php">million dollar tags</a> I can use. I don't think a two bit bookmarklet is up to the job.</p>
<p>(And is it just me, or does Mark's million dollar markup prevent the Movable Type bookmarklet from working in my <a title="Mozilla" href="http://www.mozilla.org/">two-bit browser</a>? Why, I'm surprised that anyone links to him at all. :-) <b>Update</b> Mark points out that it <em>is</em> <a href="/2002/12/31/2056.php#comments">just me</a>.</p>
