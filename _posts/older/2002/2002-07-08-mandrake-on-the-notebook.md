<p>After struggling for some hours trying <a href="/2002/06/23/1781.php#001781">to get WiFi to work with a FreeBSD notebook</a> and my Linux router, I gave up. The notebook would purr lovingly when I put the other card in my FreeBSD workstation, but stubbornly refused to talk to Linux. Since I just want the thing to work, I gave up and put Mandrake 8.2 on the notebook. It's what we use at work, so I can keep updated, and it took just 2 tries to get online. I'm still not completely wireless, since the battery is still shot, but I can get that repaired or replaced. And there's a power outlet on the patio. And the weather is supposed to get better.</p>
