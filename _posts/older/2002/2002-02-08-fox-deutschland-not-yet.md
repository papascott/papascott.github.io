<p>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/08/business/media/08KIRC.html">Germans Trying to Fend Off Murdoch for Kirch</a>. Both Stoiber and Schröderhave an interest in saving Kirch, since Kirch is in &euro;2BN deep to the half-state-owned Bayerische Landesbank, and Schröder certainly wouldn't want to see an arch-conservative Murdoch (or Berlusconi) on the German airwaves.<br />
The entertainment programming on Kirch's ProSieben already looks like a Fox Deutschland, though.</p>
