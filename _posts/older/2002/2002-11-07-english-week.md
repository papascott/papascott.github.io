<p>Mama's away again for 3 days, so I'm doing an 'English week' with Christopher. Last night her employer opened its first European <a href="http://www.donatos.com" title="Donato's Pizza">partner brand</a> location in <a href="http://www.donatos.de" title="Donato's Germany">Munich</a>, a concept she hopes to bring here up north. So you could say she flew to Munich for pizza. She gets back Friday, but has some charity/community function in Hamburg that night, so she won't see Christopher and I awake until Saturday morning.</p>
<p>('English week' is a German sports term. English soccer teams usually play twice a week, while German teams usually play just once, on the weekend. When a German team does have a midweek match, they call it an English week.)</p>
