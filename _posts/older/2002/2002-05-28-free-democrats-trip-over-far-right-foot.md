<p>JTA: <a href="http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=11353&amp;intcategoryid=2">Large German party in turmoil over accusations of anti-Semitism</a>. Or for the Free Democrats, with a party vice-chair like Jürgen Möllemann, who needs enemies? Is his flirt with anti-Semetism just stupid, or is he trying to sabotage party chair and chancellor candidate Westerwelle? But now, according to <a href="http://www.focus.de/G/GN/gn.htm?snr=106128&amp;streamsnr=7&amp;q=1">Focus</a>, he says he is sorry. Maybe he should stick to his hobby of skydiving.</p>
