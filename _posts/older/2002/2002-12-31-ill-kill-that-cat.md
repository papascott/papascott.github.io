<p>Via <a title="WorldWideKlein Weblog" href="http://www.worldwideklein.tv/nothing_more.php?id=2677_0_2_0_M">WorldWideKlein</a>, the Washington Post has an article on the German New Year's Eve <a href="/2001/12/31/1607.php">tradiition</a>: watching <a title="Auld Lang Syne's English Accent (washingtonpost.com)" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56521-2002Dec30.html">Dinner For One</a>. The Abendblatt has an <a title="Hamburger Abendblatt: Stilvoll stolpern" hreflang="de" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/12/31/109060.html">interview</a> with the original cameraman. It was originally a throwaway scene for a variety show, NDR first showed it for New Year's Eve 10 years later. Today they are running it <a title="Hamburger Abendblatt: Dinner for One" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/12/31/109069.html">5 times</a>: twice in original black and white, twice colorized, and once <em>up platt</em> (in north German dialect). </p>
<p>What do Germans see in a English-language theatre sketch from the 1920s? No one knows. <em>"Maybe it's that our Prussian humor is similar to British humor. But then again, the British don't think it's funny, so maybe it's not British humor after all."</em></p>
