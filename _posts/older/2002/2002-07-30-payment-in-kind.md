<p>Instead of enjoying the warm (most Germans would call it hot) summer evening, I instead get to deal with the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20020730.txt">OpenSSL vulnerability</a>, which by extension affects everything built with OpenSSL (including SSH and apache mod_ssl), fixing all our exposed machines at work. But it seems dangerous enough to take the evening time to fix it. At least I could do it from the coolness of our basement, and fixing SSH while logged in via SSH a pretty recursive, I think.</p>
