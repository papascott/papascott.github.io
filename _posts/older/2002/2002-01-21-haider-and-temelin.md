<p>Guardian: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,634360,00.html">Haider plays nuclear power games</a>. Today the petition drive launched by Jörg Haider's FPÖ in against the Czech nuclear plant in Temelin comes to an end. Haider has called on 1 million Austrians to sign the petition, which calls for Austria to block admission of the Czech Republic to the EU until Temelin is shut down. The petition could bring the end of the ruling coalition in Austria, as Premier Schüssel (ÖVP) has already promised not to block Czech admission.</p>
