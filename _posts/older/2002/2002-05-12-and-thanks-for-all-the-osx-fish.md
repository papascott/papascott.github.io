<p>A belated thanks to all those who answered my question about <a href="/2002/04/18/index.php#001712">How Many Macs Run OSX</a>, especially to <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/">Der Schockwellenreiter</a>, since his <a href="http://www.bankgesellschaft.de">favorite bank</a> (er, <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/05/10.html#a5318">not</a>)  is one of my employer's clients. JÃ¶rg, I don't suppose you do any online banking there, do you? :-)  Anyway, my conclusion is that most people aren't updating to OSX, but will use it if their new equipment comes with it, much like Windows XP.</p>
