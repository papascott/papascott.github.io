<p>For the past week, ever since the rain stopped and it got warm, my lungs have felt like a pair of full sponges, and I've had a persistent cough that made my head spin. But no fever. Yesterday I went to the doctor. He said it sounded like asthma, although I have no history of asthma at all. The lung test was negative, but he still sent me home with a <a href="http://www.pari.de/english/300/310/314/">PariBoy inhalator</a> and a box of Emser Salt solution. I'm skeptical. I'm home from work and feeling better today, but I think it's because the rain started again last night.</p>
