<p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/10#When:9:50:57AM">Smart</a> <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html">people</a> who should know better are quoting the <a href="http://websidestory.com/cgi-bin/wss.cgi?corporate&amp;news&amp;press_1_193">report</a> that "Internet Explorer... now has a global usage share of 96 percent". Apart from the fact that the number is ridiculous on its face (how many users are on platforms for which IE is not available?), if you scroll down to the small print, you can read that "StatMarket publishes information gathered from... more than 125,000 sites actively using WebSideStory?s HitBox", which is everything other than a random sample. A very large grain of salt is recommended.</p>
