<p>Reuters: <a href="http://reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=worldnews&StoryID=1637303">Raid Ends Moscow Theater Siege, 67 Hostages Die</a>. That's probably the best result one could have hoped for, given that previous hostage takings by Chechen terrorists and rescue efforts by Russian special forces had resulted in death tolls in the hundreds. <b>Update</b> ZDF now speaks of 90 hostages killed, over 350 in hospital, and called the chemical used by the special forces 'nerve gas'. </p>
<p>There have been a number of links back to me on this subject. Hey, all I did was watch and listen to the news. I'm no expert on Russia. I've never been to Russia and speak no Russian. I also seem to have been a bit misunderstood. I did not <a href="http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/2002/10/26.html#a587">wonder why noone had blogged</a> the subject. I simply noted the fact that I hadn't seen anything about it yet. And sometimes <a href="http://www.couchblog.de/nico/archives/000752.php">silence</a> can say a great deal.</p>
