<p>Six pm in Germany on NDR, Monday through Thursday, in households with small children it's time for <a href="http://www.ndr.de/tv/sesamstrasse/">Sesamstrasse</a>, the German version of Sesame Street. Christopher is now old enough to follow along, so I try to arrange our afternoon schedule so he can watch. The street scenes are made in Hamburg (featuring Samson the bear instead of Big Bird, sometimes with <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?S%E4gebrecht,+Marianne">Marianne SÃ¤gebrecht</a> of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0095801">Bagdad Cafe</a> fame), and the segments seem to be about 50-50 German/American.</p>
