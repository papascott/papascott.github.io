<p>One of those days today. All I could do is fix little problems that nobody else notices anyway. Like checking bad and malformed links with <a href="http://degraaff.org/checkbot/">checkbot</a>.  Or <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=https://www.papascott.de/">XHTML 1.0 validation</a> (just don't try to validate any of my archives). I sure couldn't accomplish anything useful today.</p>
