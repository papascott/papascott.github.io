<p><a href="http://www.nj.com/newsflash/international/index.ssf?/cgi-free/getstory_ssf.cgi?a0648_BC_Italy-NaziMassacre&&news&newsflash-international">NJ.com: German president visits, survivors recall Nazi massacre in Italy</a> Despite (or maybe bacause of) all the current horrors in the world, listening to a radio report this morning of the over 950 civilians rounded up and shot by Germans in 1944 in Marzabotto really turned my stomach. Especially passages like "they began to shoot, firing low to make sure they hit the children."</p>
