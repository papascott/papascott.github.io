<p>In between all the soccer matches, bicycle races, plane crashes, and corporate crashes, there's an election campaign going on here in Germany. A <a href="http://www.faz.net/IN/INtemplates/faznet/default.asp?tpl=event/content.asp&amp;doc={8D7210F2-C0EB-48EE-9FDF-3CECAA80B276}&amp;rub={B14F8BC8-7A2B-47C8-ABC9-226E5D69CB15}">Forsa poll</a> released today shows that niether Black-Yellow (Union 39%/FDP 8%) under Stoiber nor Red-Green (SPD 36%/Greens 7%) under Schröder would have a majority.  The ex-communist PDS (6%) holds the balance of power. The PDS would tolerate a Red-Green government, but it remains to be seen whether Schröder would tolerate being tolerated. The trend for the Union/FDP is falling, as this is their lowest rating in 8 months. </p>
<p>On a personal level on who Germans would prefer as Chancellor, Schröder leads Stoiber by a wide margin (49% to 36% in the last poll I saw). Not that it matters... German election ballots list parties and not Chancellor candidates.</p>
<p>My feeling is that Schröder is slicker than Slick Willy when it comes to campaigning, and that Stoiber, used to safe majorities in Bavaria, is a babe in the woods when it comes to a real election and has no idea what's going to hit him. But I'm rooting for Stoiber to lose, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.</p>
