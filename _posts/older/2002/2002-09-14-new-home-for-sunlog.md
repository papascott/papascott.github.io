<p>As <a href="http://www.sunflyer.ch/site.php?sid=7c7eb78f0cfd01dcafe4fb11514a4666&page=1">reported</a> by its former maintainer, the German PHP/MySQL weblogging package <a href="http://www.sunlog.org">Sunlog</a> has a <a href="http://www.fiene.tv/">new maintainer</a>,  and a new home at <a href="http://bytecamp.net/">bytecamp.net</a> (who also host PapaScott). I nearly chose Sunlog for PapaScott. It's a nice package, and it's good to see that work on it will continue.</p>
