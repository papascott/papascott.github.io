<p>Like Garret, I'm happy to see <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/">Karl</a> back up and active again. Maybe because his career is self-made like mine, but especially with pieces of his like this: <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/mt/archives/000032.shtml#000032">Wal-Mart IS the New Economy</a>. And yes, <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type's</a> interface <i>is</i> sweet.  I would feel better if there were a database behind it, though, instead of having to re-render all those text files all the time.</p>
