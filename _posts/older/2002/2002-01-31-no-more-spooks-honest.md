<p>No English links (maybe tomorrow in FAZ?), but the main story today is a Bundestag hearing on the NPD Informant Affair. Schilly swears that there are no more governemnt informants cited in the complaint, at least he's pretty sure. Noone is calling for Schilly to resign anymore, and all parties (even the FDP, which was wavering) agree to resubmit the complaint, but the court decision will most likely not come until after the fall election.<br />
<b>Update</b> I knew the FAZ would come through: <a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&amp;doc={A99B6C17-8241-444A-B83C-20267968B947}">Interior Minister Refuses Blame</a></p>
