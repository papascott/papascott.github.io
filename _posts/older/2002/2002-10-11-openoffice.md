<p>My big accomplishment for this week was getting <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> compiled and installed on FreeBSD. It was an accomplishment only in that it took nearly a day to download (130 MB over ISDN) and another day to compile (update to <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD 4.7</a> first). Not that I have any real use for an office package, but sometimes you can't avoid having to use one. At work we are going to be cutting way back on the number of MS Office licenses (I think down to 20; we have 130 employees). The rest of us will have OpenOffice.</p>
