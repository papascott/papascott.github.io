<ul>
<li>Wine glasses. We have 6, but we need 8. Might as well go to Ikea and get a set.</li>
<li>I'm at Ikea anyway, so pick up a couple of Lack shelves for my brother-in-law.</li>
<li>Goose breast, on special at Minimal, so Mama and I can have a private Christmas dinner on the 26th even if the goose from the 25th is history.</li>
<li>Salami, as long as I'm at Minimal anyway.</li>
<li>Potatoes for baking, for the 24th. We have plenty of regular pototoes, but no big ones.</li>
<li>A sled for Christopher? Probably not, the weather is going to thaw and turn slushy.</li>
</ul>
