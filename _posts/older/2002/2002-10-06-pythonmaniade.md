<p>I'm usually not partial to scripting languages where nothing means something (i.e. whitespace has meaning), but <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/">Schockwellenreiter</a> JÃ¶rg Kantel has announced <a href="http://www.pythonmania.de/">pythonmania.de</a>, a German site with "Tips und Tricks zu Python 'cause I'm the Mac Man and a Python Fan". Here's hoping that fellow Python Fan <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/python/index.html">Mark Pilgrim</a> will pay notice. Hit that link a few dozen times to get Mark's attention, I understand he pays attention to his referers.</p>
