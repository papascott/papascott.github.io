<p>Spiegel: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,184731,00.html">Schröder sagt Prag-Reise ab</a> (Schröder cancels Prague visit). It all started with Haider's campaign in Austria to block Czech entry to the EU. In an interview in response, Czech Prime Minister Zeman said that the Sudetendeutschen (expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1945) were all traitors loyal to Hitler. In the end both he and Schröder have election campaigns and would just as soon avoid the expulsion issue (seeing as they each have opponents more hard line on the issue). So let's just call the whole thing off.<br />
<b>Update:</b> BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_1846000/1846915.stm">Schroeder snubs Prague</a>.</p>
