<p>In the excitement yesterday, I forgot to mention that it was our 19th wedding anniversary. Mama and I remembered to each other, and in light of recent blogger weddings I was planning on writing a long recount of September 6, 1983. But now that I've missed it, I think I'll wait until next year. But an Irish pub and a lesbian disco both played a role in the festivities. As did the INS.</p>
<p><b>Update</b> Thanks for the well wishes, folks! And I did write up an <a href="https://www.papascott.de/2002/09/09/1876.php#001876">account of our wedding day</a> after all.</p>
