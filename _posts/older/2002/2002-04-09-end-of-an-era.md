<p><a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/contents/ha/news/lokales/html/090402/0909HAFT22.HTM">Hamburger Abendblatt: Hamburg-Berlin: Fl√ºge eingestellt</a> (Hamburg-Berlin: Flights discontinued). Lufthansa has discontinued one of the world's oldest scheduled airline routes, dating back to March 1919. Service was discontinued during the Second World War. The route was regulated by the occupying powers after the war. Only after reunification was Lufthansa allowed to resume service. Today, with the Deutsche Bahn connecting the cities in less than 2 hours, air service is unable to compete.</p>
