<p>My folks have finalized their plans to meet us in Las Vegas the week of April 21. They'll be able to have as much of Christopher as they can handle!</p>
<p>I'm trying out <a href="http://brentashley.manilasites.com/2002/02/24">BlogChat</a>, which is not only a wonderful way to waste time chatting, but might actually have some practical use (chatting with my parents, or with Mama upstairs when we're on our respective PCs). Here's the link... I'll try it out this evening (German time), so it it says I'm online, you can try it out:</p>
<p><a href="#" title="you can chat with me if i'm in" onclick="window.open('https://www.papascott.de/blogchat/anybodyhome.php','','height=230,width=355,toolbar=no,location=no,resizable=yes');return false;"><img src="https://www.papascott.de/blogchat/thedoctoris.php" alt="you can chat with me if i'm in" border="0" /></a></p>
