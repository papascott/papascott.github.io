<p>I'm back on Movable Type, but I'm not a happy camper at the moment. The MySQL Perl modules are still broken at my hoster, so I've gone back to DB files. There's no automatic way to do that, so I bascally reinstalled MT, reset all my preferences, and re-imported all my entries. The date-based archives will not rebuild, niether daily nor monthly, and so all links to them are broken. I'll probably have to end up changing hosters, or blogging software, or maybe both.</p>
