<p>I'm sure there is news occuring somewhere in the world today, but you'd never know it watching televsion here in Germany. On ZDF, for example, over half the evening news plus an hour-long special report is devoted to Germany reaching the World Cup Final with a 1-0 win over South Korea. No news event (other than 9-11) would receive this much coverage.</p>
<p>That must really get on the nerves of those Germans who do not care at all about sports.</p>
