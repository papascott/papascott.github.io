<p>This morning the radio traffic report announced that a section of the Autobahn 7 south of Hamburg would be closed for 30 minutes. Yet another unexploded bomb from the Second World War had been found and was to be defused. Such announcements occur every month or so. But this time I couldn't help but think that if a rich developed country like Germany was still finding remnants of its last war after over 50 years, how long will it take Angola, Bosnia or Afghanistan? Or Ground Zero in Manhatten?<br />
I then realized that I would be safe in my office during the closure, and drove on.</p>
