<p>Americans will wonder at this... the lead story on last night's <a href="http://www.tagesthemen.de">late news</a> was about.... literature. And they went on and on, for at least 10 minutes. In short, the FAZ is refusing to publish the new novel by Martin Walser, "Death of a Critic", because they say it is anti-Semitic and that the <a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FFE-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&amp;doc={9F018D5D-01B5-46D4-9D65-290CA8EE3CBE}">dead critic is intended to be the real-life FAZ critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki</a>. The publisher could not have orchestrated a better PR campaign.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much the typical German viewer cares about Walser and Reich-Ranicki, but I guess this was better than seeing yet another panic story about the <a href="http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?x39453821">Nitrofen scandal</a>.</p>
