<p>I've always liked the  <a href="http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/spane.php?open=1">Sidebar Panel</a> from <a href="http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker">Blogtracker</a>, and wished I could somehow include it here.  Now I've discovered <a href="http://blo.gs">blo.gs</a>, a service similar to blogtracker, and my dream has come true, since blo.gs can export a favorites list as XML. Thanks to the <a href="http://philringnalda.com/phpblogroll/">PHP blo.gs blogroll</a> at philringnalda.com, my favorite list with update times gets pulled once an hour for your (but mostly my) viewing pleasure. </p>
<p><b>Update</b>:  I've now<a href="/examples/blogroll-ps.phps"> posted </a>my version of the script.</p>
