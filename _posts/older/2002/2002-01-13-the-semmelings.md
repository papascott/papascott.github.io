<p>Against our better judgement we've been watching the 6 part ZDF mini-series <a href="http://www.zdf.de/unterhaltung/semmeling">The Semmelings</a>. At least we didn't start watching until part 3, so we're only wasting 4 evenings. Since it was filmed at original locations in Hamburg, we spend as much time trying to guess where the current scene was filmed as we do following the story.<br />
The fountain in the courtyard of the Hamburg Rathaus is shown in several scenes. Its restoration was sponsored in part by Mama's employer, but there is no company logo to be seen.</p>
