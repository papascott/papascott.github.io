<p>We've now back in Germany after 2-1/2 weeks in Las Vegas and Phoenix. Of course Christopher weathered the flight much better than we did. And I just realized that funny smell and feeling in our house is non-air-condiditioned air.</p>
<p>I need to catch up on news, especially what Adam Curry has to say about <a href="http://live.curry.com/stories/2002/05/08/theBigLie.html">the big lie</a> about the death of Pim Fortuyn.</p>
<p>I see it's also time to update <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Moveable Type</a></p>
