<p>We're 'enjoying' the north Germany 'high summer' (cloudy, cold, rainy). (Update: So is <a href="http://www.couchblog.org/nico/archives/000323.php">Nico</a>.) Work is busier than ever since we've been minus one for 6 weeks. (My ex-colleague was able to find work already, administering firewalls for <a href="http://www.otto.de">the world's largest catalog merchant</a>.) I can't stretch my work day past Christopher's pick-up time at day care, so it's a daily struggle to get things done before having to leave.</p>
<p>A follow-up on my <a href="https://www.papascott.de/2002/04/18/1712.php">Mac question</a> from a couple months ago. We did end up getting a <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">TFT iMac</a> for our QM department. (It arrived within 24 hours, so I guess Apple is indeed having trouble selling them. And why did it come with only OS 9.2 installed?). My question: <b>Are there any web resources for PC/Unix admins adding the first Mac to their network?</b> I find plenty of infos for <i>users</i> switching to Macs, but not for PC admins who now have a new beast in their menagerie. (I do know about <a href="http://diveintoosx.org/">Dive Into OSX</a>, but that seems to be for experienced Mac admins.)</p>
