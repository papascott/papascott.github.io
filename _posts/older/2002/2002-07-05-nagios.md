<p>At work I've been looking pretty hard the past couple of days at <a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a>, a web-based network monitoring system formerly konwn as <a href="http://www.netsaint.org/">NetSaint</a>.  We currently have a combination of <a href="http://pikt.org">pikt</a> and a home-brewed SMS notification/ticketing system that's powerful but difficult to update and expand. We'd like to be able to add new systems to the montioriing with a couple of web clicks (instead of editing a bunch of text files). Nagios might be able to do that, and if I can somehow connect the SMS system to Nagios, we'll be better off. (For Americans, SMS is text messaging via cell phone.)</p>
