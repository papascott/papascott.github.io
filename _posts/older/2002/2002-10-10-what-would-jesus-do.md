<p>Strange mail today from the District of Paderborn, Nordrhein-Westfalen. Mama's company car was caught speeding there, clearly visible on photo radar. The driver is not clearly visible, except that it is a male wearing a tie, and the authorities are asking her to identify the driver. According to her driver's logbook, she was on the road that day with the vice-chair (who insisted on driving) and a member of her company's German board of directors. So does she implicate her boss' boss, or does she stay silent and take the fine and the points (&euro;50 and 3 points, according the the <a href="http://www.adac.de/Recht_und_Rat/Verkehrssuenden/Verkehrsverstoesse_und_ihre_Auswirkungen/Das_kosten_Verkehrsverstoesse">ADAC</a> auto club) for herself?</p>
