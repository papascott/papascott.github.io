<p>NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/18/international/europe/18EURO.html">Americans Stay Home, and Europe Feels a Pinch</a>. My folks noticed that their flight to Frankfurt was just 60% full,  and the tour dates to Scandinavia they wanted were 'unavailable' (they suspect cancelled). They are joining their tour tomorrow, and are hoping things will be not crowded. Their return flight to the States is on Friday the 13th. That might be mostly empty. :-)</p>
