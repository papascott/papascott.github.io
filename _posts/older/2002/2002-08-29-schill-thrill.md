<p>Spiegel Online: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,211507,00.html">Flut-Wahlkampf mit Schill-Thrill</a> (Flood Campaigning with Schill Thrill). My favorite Interior Senator is at it again. Judge Merciless Ronald Barnabas Schill gave his first speech Bundestag speech today, during a debate on the financing the emergency flood relief. He ranted for 15 minutes on how immigration policy was to blame for the proposed tax cut, went over his allotted time, and had his microphone turned off after he said the Bundestag was 'kicking the constitution' for limiting his speaking time. Even Hamburg First Mayor von Beust has distanced himself from his coaltion partner and Second Mayor. I stick by my theory. He's sabotaging his own party's Bundestag campaign.</p>
