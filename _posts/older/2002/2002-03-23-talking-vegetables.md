<p>It's Saturday, Christopher could sense it, and woke us up early. MamaMaus sent us boys downstairs so she could get back to sleep. There is no milk or Brotchen in the house, so breakfast is delayed until the bakery/grocery store opens.</p>
<p>Mark Pilgrim has switched <a href="http://diveintomark.org">diveintomark</a> to <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org">MT2</a>, and was also able to <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/03/22.html#movable_type">import his old GreyMatter and Manila posts</a>. If he can do it, so can I, right? Well, I hope he posts he script he used. I'm too lazy, er, I mean busy to come up with my own. :-)</p>
