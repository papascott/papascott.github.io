<p>Yesterday was totally uninspired. Whatever I tried at work backfired, I was going backwards instead of making progress. Mama's out of town, and Christopher was wary and antsy. After I left him in bed bed he got up again and fell on his head. He said his ear hurt badly, and he is not prone to simulate such things. I could see no external signs of injury, but I still had visions of a concussion or worse. A cold pack seemed to help, but it then took another 2 hours to get him to sleep. </p>
<p>I've started adding RSS links to the <a href="https://www.papascott.de/sidebar.php">papascott blogroll</a>, by hand for now, being uninspired. I will be doing something more intelligent with them,  I promise.</p>
