<p>Confusion reigns at work, but at least I have something to show for it. Among the booty from our closed office in Leipzig is a <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac">700 MHz TFT iMac</a>. Since noone else knows what to do with it, it's sitting on my desk for now. The first thing I did was download <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>, to find out what all the fuss is about. The next thing I need to do is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=os x forgot root password">hack the root password</a>. I need to try out the <a href="/2001/07/26/1507.html">'kill 1'</a> trick again.</p>
