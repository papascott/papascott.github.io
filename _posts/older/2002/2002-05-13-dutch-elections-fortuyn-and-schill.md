<p>For background in English on the elections in Holland on Wednesday, you might want to check out the Netherlands edition of <a href="http://www.expatica.com/index.asp?s=0">Expatica</a>, a community website for expatriates with an extensive news section. I'll ask <a href="http://live.curry.com">Adam</a> if he thinks the stories there are any good. </p>
<p>I'm also surprised not to have seen any comparisons of Fortuyn with Germany's political maverick, Hamburg's Interior Senator "Judge Merciless" Ronald Schill. They have a number of surface similarities: both are celebrities new to politics, right of center without being radical right, founding parties that bear their names. However, Schill's celebrity is local to Hamburg, and his law-and-order platform is tailored for urban voters. Although his party pulled 4% in Sachsen-Anhalt last month, he doesn't have national ambitions, at least not for this year (he's supporting Stoiber). And Schill is nowhere near as charismatic as Fortuyn.</p>
<p>(The <a href="http://www.schill-partei.de/">Schill Party website</a> is in German only, but it does have a picture of the good judge, and you can decide for yourself whether he would look any better with a Pim Fortuyn haircut.)</p>
