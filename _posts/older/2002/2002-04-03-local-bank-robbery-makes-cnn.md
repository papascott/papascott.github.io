<p>Our local bank robbery has made CNN: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/04/03/german.robbery/index.html">Robbers held after 3-nation chase</a>. OK, not all bank robbers crash two borders with hostages trying to reach Kiev. Uelzen is just south of LÃ¼neburg, one county next to ours. The ICE train slows down there slightly on the way to Hannover.</p>
