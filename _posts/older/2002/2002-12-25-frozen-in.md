<p>The ice has only gotten worse. It rained and thawed this afternoon, only to freeze again this evening. Large BMWs with rear-wheel drive are <em>not</em> able to negotiate ice-coated cobblestones, as Mama found out when taking Oma Ruth home. The BMW is now parked at the bottom of our street, waiting for better traction.</p>
<p>All guests were able to make it to the Christmas feast, and more importantly, all were able to make it home safely.</p>
