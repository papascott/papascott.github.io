<p>FAZ <a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&doc={1B9ED4C2-B8A7-412D-9ACB-3A325414D261}">Interior Minister to Undergo Drug Test</a>. Hamburg's 'Judge Merciless' makes national headlines again, but now on the defensive. Celebrity parties where cocaine was seen, bodyguards with Mafia ties, and now a sworn statement that he rubbed 'white powder' on his gums. He calls the TV report a 'pig magazine' and swears to have his hair analyzed. Shades of Christoph Daum, and Schill has the same wild look in his eyes.</p>
