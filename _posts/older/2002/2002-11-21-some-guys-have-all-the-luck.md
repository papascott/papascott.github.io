<p>Maybe I should just get used to the fact that every time Mama goes on a business trip, some sort of disaster strikes. This time it's a failure of day care coordination. The original failed (our <em>Tagesm√ºtter</em> is at a conference), the backup failed (she forgot to inform her substitute that we were coming), and the backup of the backup failed (the substitute is leaving on vacation today). And the tape in the vault is missing (Oma is out of town). And there is no Plan D. So I'm burning a vacation day today with Christopher. At least it's Mama's last trip for the fall, and she won't have another big trip until March.</p>
