<p>I finally got Christopher to the photographer yesterday for his passport pictures. Since the US passport takes a different format than German ID, we couldn't use the instant passport picutres, but instead had to pay for a portrait. Christopher was in no mood to be photographed, so he looks very skeptical. Back at the <a href="http://www.usembassy.de">US Embassy</a> website, I found more information on <a href="http://travel.state.gov/specialreq.html">issuing passports to minors</a> as well as an <a href="http://travel.state.gov/DS-3053.pdf">official form in PDF</a> for Mama to give her consent, and also found out that foreign-issued passports are now produced in the US, explaining the increased cost and the long wait (2 to 3 weeks). That's probably good. My consulate-produced passport from 1994 is green, is not machine-readable, and looks like something I pasted together in my basement. It gets strange looks at every border I cross.</p>
