<p>For the first time we've had trick-or-treaters come to the house in Lüllau, 2 groups of girls. I think they were confusing Halloween with <a href="/archives/2000/06/12/pentecost/">Pentecost</a>, since both groups <em>sang</em> at the door. Of course we didn't have any candy, but they were satisfied with coins. Judging from the decorations at the shops and restaurants, it looks like the holiday is catching on more and more in Germany. <em>Süßes oder Saueres!</em></p>
