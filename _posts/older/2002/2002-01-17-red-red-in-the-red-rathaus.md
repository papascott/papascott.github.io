<p>DPA: <a href="http://www.expatica.com/germany.asp?pad=190,205,&amp;item_id=18614">Berlin assembly votes in mayor</a>, and so begins the red-red (SPD and the ex-communist PDS) coalition. The Bundestag won't have PDS cover-boy Gregor Gysi to kick around anymore, but I'm sure as Commerce Senator he'll stay in the talk shows, although Klaus Wowereit <a href="http://de.news.yahoo.com/020113/3/2k02z.html">seems to gotten awful close</a> to talk show host Sabine Christiansen the other night. And I thought he said he was gay, and that it was "gut so".</p>
