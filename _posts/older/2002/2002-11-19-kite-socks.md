<p>Christopher is very picky about his clothes. He always has been, but lately it has been extreme. He has to have an undershirt, a white, sleeveless undershirt. He has to have overalls, with pockets, they are his 'railroad pants'. And he has to have his kite socks, of which we only have one pair. We have to trick Christopher to be able to wash them, or wait until he is asleep. That's why the first thing Mama said when I woke up this morning was "I can't find the kite socks." They were on the radiator in the bathroom. I had put them there to dry.</p>
