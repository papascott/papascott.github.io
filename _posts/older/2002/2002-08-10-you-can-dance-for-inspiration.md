<p>PapaScott has been lately suffering from an overabundance of work (we found out the hard way that a <strike>universal</strike>uninterruptable power supply can be a single point of failure... I leave details to the imagination) and a shortage of inspiration. The situation will only become worse in the next couple of weeks, as Christopher's grandparents are coming for an extended visit, and Mama and I are dividing the hosting responsibilities (subtitle for this post: 'Separate Vacations'). I'm not sure whether the effect on the weblog will be noticeable (can a decrease in creativity be noticed when the amount of creativity was quite small to begin with?), but at least I'll be feeling less bad about it. Or at least more justified. Or whatever.</p>
