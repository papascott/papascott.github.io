<p>Our ISDN router, an old 100 MHz machine running <a href="http://www.fli4l.de/">Linux on a floppy</a>, wouldn't restart last night. I spent 2 hours to figure out that it was the <i>video</i> card that went south. Strange, because it never has a monitor attached. The video card is only there because the BIOS insists on having it.</p>
