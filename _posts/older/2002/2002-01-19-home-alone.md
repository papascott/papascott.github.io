<p>Christopher and I have a Mama-free day today. We went shopping for a CPU and motherboard for a to upgrade a secondary machine for XP. We went low-end (Duron 1000 and ECS K7S5A), which is still better than what is in my main machine. I got things running just as Christopher finished his nap, then stopped. Screwing together PC components is not a good father-son activity with a 2-year-old.</p>
