<p>Christopher's new word this weekend is 'lade', pronounced LAW-deh. As in the last part of 'Schokolade', German for chocolate. </p>
<p>I haven't been able to find the answer myself, and <a href="http://radio.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$12317?mode=topic&amp;y=2002&amp;m=3&amp;d=23">my post</a> on the Radio discussion list has gone unanswered, so I'll try here: how can I download my Manila site using the current version of Radio? The <a href="http://radio.userland.com/manilaSiteConverterTool">ManilaSiteConverter</a> and <a href="http://www.thetwowayweb.com/stories/storyReader$50">TheXmlFiles</a> tools do not work. Or must I use XML-RPC, or work with the <a href="http://manilanewbies.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1019">downloadable mysite.root database</a>?</p>
