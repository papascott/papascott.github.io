<p>Christopher is playing with his Lego trains, and he is telling me <a href="http://dict.leo.org/?search=klappe">'Klappe!'</a>, which means 'Shut up!', as in <em>Halt die Klappe!</em>  I'm thinking, what kind of words is he learning at day care anyway? Then Mama explains he means the actual meaning of the noun, as in a flap, latch or valve. He means the switch on the Lego tracks. I need to turn it so the train can pass. I guess a switch can be a latch laying on its side. Sorry Christopher, I didn't mean to assume that you were being inpolite.</p>
