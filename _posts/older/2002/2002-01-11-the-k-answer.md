<p>BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_1755000/1755686.stm">German right settles election rivalry</a><br />
BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_1756000/1756007.stm">Edmund Stoiber: Bavaria's 'pitbull'</a><br />
So it's Stoiber after all. A safer but less interesting choice than Merkel, but in my opinion the easier opponent for Schr√∂der, especially since the economy seems to be bottoming out right now and the election is not until September.</p>
