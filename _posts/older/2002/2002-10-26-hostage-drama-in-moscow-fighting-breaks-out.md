<p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,220044,00.html">Spiegel Online</a> is reporting that fighting has broken out between special forces and the hostage takers outside the theatre in Moscow, and that some hostages are managing to escape in the confusion. The situation seems just as desparate as I feared yesterday. Last night German TV (well, at least ZDF) was again full of long special reports on the crisis, while the sniper in the US was mentioned 'only' as a report during the normal newscast. But then Moscow is closer than Washington, and there's no ocean in between. And the US has seemed to have solved the sniper problem, while in Moscow there is no solution in sight. Or perhaps even possible.</p>
<p><b>Update</b> Russian special forces have apparently taken control of the theatre, killing the leader of the terrorists: <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&ncid=716&e=1&u=/ap/20021026/ap_on_re_eu/russia_theater_raid">AP</a>, <a href="http://reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=worldnews&StoryID=1636744">Reuters</a>. While there are bodies being carried out, it seems most of the hostages have survived.</p>
