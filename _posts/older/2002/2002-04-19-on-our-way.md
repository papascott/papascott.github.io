<p>We're packed up and ready to go! Departure from the house tomorrow is at 5:30 am, so we got to get to bed early and sleep well. Then 20 hours HAM-FRA-LAX-LAS. We arrive in Vegas tomorrow evening, and plan to crash at the hotel and become conscious again at about noon on Sunday. I hope Christopher sticks to this plan. He's already excited about "Flugzeuge" and "airplanes". Then again, he's excited about anything large and motorized, like bulldozers ("Bagger!") and tractors ("Trecker!"). I'll try to drop notes here from time to time. And we do plan to drop in on <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/">Hal, Audrey and Ian</a></p>
