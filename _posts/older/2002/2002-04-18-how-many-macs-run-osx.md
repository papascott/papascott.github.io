<p>Here's a question for my readers who are <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de">Mac </a><a href="http://www.vfth.com/">Men</a> (or <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com">Mac </a><a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/">Women</a>): what percentage of actively used Macs run OSX? A fourth? A third? Half? I suspect my employer needs a OSX-capable machine to test our products, but I don't have any numbers to back up my suspicion. We're all Unix geeks who have no clue about Macs. Feel free to leave a comment.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Thanks to Garret for the link, and welcome to a couple of new folks who left comments. I should also be a bit more specific. My employer sells server software for home banking and brokerage, so I'm really interested in how many folks would use OSX for home banking with a web browser (either with a login/password or a key stored on diskette or chipcard).</p>
