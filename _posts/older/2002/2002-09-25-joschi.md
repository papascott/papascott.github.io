<p>I may watch too much news together with Christopher. He's starting to recognize politicians on TV. Or at least one politician, namely Joschka Fischer. Last week ZDF was showing live speeches of the main candidates, and I was naming them for Christopher. Look, there's Edi. And there's Gerd. And Angie. And there's Joschi! Fischer does have a friendly figure on television, and his name and face have stuck with my son. At least I can give him a reason to watch the news with me instead of his Kleine Eisbär video. We might get to see Joschi!</p>
<p>BTW, my regular readers might have missed the oodles of <a href="/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1903">comments</a> about German-American relations after my rant about Schröder was linked to by <a href="http://www.denbeste.nu/">USS Clueless</a>.</p>
