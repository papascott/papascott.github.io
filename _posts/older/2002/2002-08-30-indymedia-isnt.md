<p>Alwin  made a couple of comments on <a href="http://www.indymedia.org/">IndyMedia</a>. Apart from giving an unconventional definition of 'independent' <a href="http://www.vfth.com/2002/08/26#MTU6NDM6MjAdb">("Independent means not taking sides. Doesn't it?")</a>, he later comments <a href="http://www.vfth.com/2002/08/29#MDc6Mzk6MjMdb">if it just seperated the editorial from the content, it would be more credible to me</a>. (See also <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/archives/000228.shtml#000228">Karl's comments.</a>)</p>
<p>I personally find IndyMedia to be unprofessional and to often play somewhat fast and loose with the facts. But I  think there is <i>no such thing</i> as news content devoid of editorial. All news has a point of view, whether it comes from AOL Time Warner or The Weekly Reader. The very fact that news  reporters and publishers are a part of society means that they have a personal stake in the news they present. Their point of view cannot be cloaked, and is expressed even in the words they use and what they choose <i>not</i> to report.</p>
<p>A reporter without a point of view has nothing to report.  News without a point of view would be utterly boring, and would not worth reading. Or buying. News without a point of view would be worthless.</p>
