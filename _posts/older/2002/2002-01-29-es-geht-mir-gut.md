<p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020129/wl/europe_storms_1.html">Storms in Europe kill at least 16</a>, including 6 in northern Germany (according to ARD) with winds up to 150 kmh. A wind generator was blown to the ground up near Husum. The wind has been quite loud here the past few nights. I thought our satellite dish would blow away for sure.   </p>
<p>Bad day yesterday. We had been out vistiting on Sunday, Christopher skipped his nap and at 6:30pm fell asleep in the car on the way home. We let him sleep, thinking he'd be up a bit earlier than usual in the morning. A 'bit' was good... at 4:30am he was already up and at 'em. I didn't recover from that until well after noon.</p>
<p>You didn't hear it from me, but if you look at your nearest <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> mirror, you might find the <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.5-RELEASE/">upcoming 4.5 release</a>.</p>
