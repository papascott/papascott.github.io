<p>I've been been smoothing out the transition from MT to b2, cleaning up the database, making the permalinks individual entries rather than anchors in an archive, replacing the MT archives with redirects to b2, adding a referer check, putting a notice in the old RSS feed that the feed has now moved, and such things. I do need to bring in the blogroll yet and massage the nav column a lot! Or maybe 2 nav columns? And I need to apply Mark Pilgrim's <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">accessibility tips</a> (which I never did in MT, since I knew the next default templates would include them, which is why I stuck with the default MT template).</p>
