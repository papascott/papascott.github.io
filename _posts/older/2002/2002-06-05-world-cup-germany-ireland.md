<p>Only <a href="http://moorbek.weblogs.com/">one</a> of the German bloggers I read claims to be following the World Cup. Those who mention it at all tend to  snicker at the colleagues/classmates/family who waste time with such things. To follow the national team is like an American saying he watches the Super Bowl. Or, an even better comparison, like an American who follows the Olympics and cheers for the USA. So I won't say anything about Germany-Ireland, except to say I now (along with most of my co-workers) have 90 minutes of work time to make up somehow. And that Ireland's tying goal was deserved.</p>
