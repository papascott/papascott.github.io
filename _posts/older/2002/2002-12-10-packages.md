<p>Chrisopher's Grandparents will be happy to know that both of his Christmas packages, sent from Minnesota on 2 Dec,  arrived yesterday, even though one was sent air-mail and the other not. Interestingly, even though they were sent via USPS, they were not delivered by the German Post, but by DHL.</p>
