<p><img alt="realschule.jpg" src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/11/realschule.jpg" width="130" height="130" border="0" align="right" />Luckily I noticed at <a href="http://blog.vollmondlicht.com/entry.php?id=511">dekaf</a> last week that the <a href="http://www.bademeister.com" title="Die Ärzte">best band in the world</a> was releasing their new album, <a href="http://www.bademeister.com/discografie/unplugged.html">Rock'n'Roll Realschule</a>, an MTV Unplugged concert. And this evening I finally caught the 5th or 6th TV repeat of the concert at the Albert-Schweitzer-Gymnasium in Hamburg. Let's just say that after the Pisa Study, my faith in German education has been restored. (And for my American readers, Die Ärzte are a punk band, and recorded their unplugged concert at a prep school, in school uniforms, backed by the school orchestra and choir, who provided the necessary volume.)</p>
