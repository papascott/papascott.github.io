<p>Just a quick note that Christopher is healthy again, we met Hal and spent a great evening with him, our digital camera is having major problems (so no pics for a while), we've left Vegas, and we're now in Phoenix for the next week. Our only goals are to relax and to see a Diamondbacks game. That's all, see you with further details next week!</p>
