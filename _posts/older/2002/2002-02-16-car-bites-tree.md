<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/carWithTree.jpg" height="107" width="143" border="0" alt="carWithTree.jpg: " align="left" /> This is <b>not</b> how my encounter with the neighbor's tree ended up yesterday, but it's close. His tree was actually much taller, but the part that hit the road was about this size.</p>
