<p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,grossbild-223629-,00.html"><img src="/images/spiegel181102.jpg" border="0" alt="Spiegel Cover 'Genosse Schröder'" align="right" /></a> Like <a href="http://www.couchblog.de/nico/archives/000880.php#000880">Nico</a>, I rather like <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,grossbild-223629-,00.html">this week's cover of Der Spiegel</a>. Lately Schröder has been acting like a politician from the previous century, so maybe the picture fits.</p>
<p>Speaking of Spiegel, <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/002701.html">vowe</a> points to a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-223258,00.html">commentary </a> there entitled 'Green Sense, Red Nonsense', that contends that the Greens are the only party making economic sense these days, while the SPD is only concerned with not irritating its lobby groups. </p>
<p>For those keeping score, the latest 'Sunday Question' poll puts the SPD at 30%, CDU 48%, Greens 10%, FDP under 5%. Of course, the problem with the Sunday Question is that everyone knows there really isn't an election this Sunday. Only every four years.</p>
