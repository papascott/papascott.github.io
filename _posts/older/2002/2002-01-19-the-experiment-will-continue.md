<p>I started this website as an experiment, to test the bloging software Movable Type, and to see if I could keep up a second weblog. The original PapaScott has been up for two years now, almost coinciding with the birth of our son, and has always been primarily a way to publish pictures and personal news for my family in Minnesota.</p>
