<p>Star Tribune: <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/509/3363555.html">Angels' 10-run seventh ends Twins' season</a>. And now there's one less thing in the world to worry about, namely the World Series. <a href="http://davespicks.com/archive/2002/1014.html">Dave's Picks</a> comments: "Baseball's a funny game sometimes. The bottom of the seventh in yesterday's game was not one of them." Amen.</p>
