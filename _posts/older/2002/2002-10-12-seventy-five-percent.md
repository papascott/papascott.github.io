<p>Thursday was the deadline for the employees to agree to the salary cuts proposed by my employer. Management had said that only with 90% agreement could lay-offs be avoided. I didn't catch the final figures, but at best only 75% are on board. The mood is one of awaiting the inevitable. I've never had so much quiet at work. I'm getting more done than ever.</p>
