<p>Christopher is desparate the build some more railroad tracks, but I just have to pull myself away to wish Mama a Happy Birthday. I got her a package of ant poison and 2 cans of propane from the garden shop. I'm sure that's just what she wanted. I won't give away her age unless she wants to, but in keeping with the World Cup, I will say that she's still in the first half and not yet in extra time. The referee isn't even checking his watch yet.</p>
