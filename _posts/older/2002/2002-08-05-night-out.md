<p>Saturday night was Christopher's first night with a real babysitter. Not Oma, not his aunt, but a real-life, underage babysitter. Since she's the daughter of his <i>Tagesmutter</i> at day care, she was someone he already knew, and it sounds he like had a very good time <i>and</i> went to bed on time. Considering all the preperations we had to make, though, the event Mama and I attended was a bit of a letdown.</p>
