<p>Yesterday we spent the day in Eckernf√∂rde, visiting with Mama's cousin Rudi visiting from New Zealand. He had left Germany as a boy in the 1950's, and after decades renewed contact with his German relatives, so that we are now seeing him for the 3rd time in 4 years. Mama has a convention in Sydney on her calendar for 2004, so she might get a chance to return the favor. Rudi was regretting missing the <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyleague/story/0,10069,805946,00.html">National Rugby League final</a> (and will be disappointed that New Zealand lost). But I know how he feels, seeing as the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/3348777.html">Twins won their playoff series</a> while I was asleep.</p>
