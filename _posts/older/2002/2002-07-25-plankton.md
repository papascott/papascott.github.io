<p>Note to self: <a href="http://iowa.weblogger.com/2002/07/24">Iowa John</a> saw a presentation on a PHP framework called <a href="http://www.sea-incorporated.com/index.php?_p=xmlContent&_xml=plankton">Plankton</a>. It looks like something I could use starting last week. Take a look at it when you get to work. <b>Later</b> Looks promising, very object-oriented, with classes for basic tasks like HTML, DB, XML. The documentation is still incomplete, so for now learning means poking around yourself. It can't be mastered in a day, but maybe in two or three? I'll keep an eye on it.</p>
