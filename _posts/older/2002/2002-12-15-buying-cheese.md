<p><a href="http://iowa.weblogger.com/2002/12/14">Iowa John</a> tells a story about buying cheese, and deciding between the fancy imported gouda and the ordinary domestic cheddar. I could tell a similar story, except here the cheddar is the fancy imported cheese, and the gouda is the cheap domestec stuff. </p>
<p>The same could go for cars, for Chryslers and BMWs. Well, almost :-).</p>
