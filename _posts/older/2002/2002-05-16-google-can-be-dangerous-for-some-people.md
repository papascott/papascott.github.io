<p>Extremely strange but true: <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/05/15.html">Der Schockwellenreiter</a> Jörg Kantel (perhaps Germany's best known blogger,  <a href="http://focus.de/F/2002/19/Internet/tagebuecher/tagebuecher.htm">recently profiled</a> in <a href="http://www.focus.de">Focus</a> magazine) found out that some people are too dumb to use Google. To sum up in English: His boss was sent a mail asking why his institute employs a pedophile named Erik Möller as IT head. But there is no Erik Möller employed there, and the IT head is Jörg. What happened? Erik Möller is a journalist who wrote a story <a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/inhalt/co/4158/1.html">'Children are Pornography'</a> on the politcs of censorship in Germany. The said nitwit did a Google Search on 'Erik Möller pädophil", which pointed to an entry in Jörg's forum (citing a different article by Mr. Möller). The dumbhead thought that Jörg's picture was that of Mr. Möller. clicked to reach Jörg's resume, and mailed the accusation to his employer. Jörg is considering legal action.</p>
<p>The lesson. Some people believe everything they think they read in the Internet, and cannot be distinguished from idiots.</p>
