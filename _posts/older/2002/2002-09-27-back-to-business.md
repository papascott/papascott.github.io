<p>Politics are going domestic again, so that means things are returning to normal. The newly elected parties are raising trial baloons over which taxes to raise, after promsing before the election not to raise any taxes. And the Union led Bundesrat refused to approve the Red/Green anti-corruption law, apparently because they are pro-corruption?</p>
<p>My employer is not doing as badly as MobilCom, which has been abandoned by sugar-daddy France Telecom and today announced it will have to cut 50% of its ca. 5000 work force. After all, this is now third time my employer has been on the brink, and we haven't fallen over yet. But maybe I'll go part-time for the 3 months instead of taking the pay cut. A few hours of extra Christopher time per week are worth far more than any stock options, I think.</p>
