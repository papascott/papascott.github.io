<p>Spiegel: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,183199,00.html">Zuwanderung: Union sagt Gespräche mit Koalition ab</a> (CDU/CSU call off immigration talks with coalition). The Union would like to block the bill without having to take any blame, so they can use immigration as a campaign issue. The government is counting on a couple of Union co-ruled Länder to defect in the Bundesrat.<br />
