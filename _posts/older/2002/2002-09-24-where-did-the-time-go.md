<p>Christopher's sick, Mama's out of town, and I should be at work already, but I'm not. I stayed home with Christopher yesterday. The thing is, he doesn't realize he's sick, so I had to keep reminding him that he has to keep his socks on, he can't go outside, and maybe he should take a nap (he didn't). Today he is sleeping in. He's well enough to go to the Tagesmutter, once he wakes up, but now it's already past 9, I wouldn't make it to the office until 10:30, and would have to leave right at 4.  My boss has offered to be flexible at such times, and today I think I'll take him up on it. At worst I'd take a vacation day from next year. So, gotta go, I hear stirring in Christopher's room....</p>
