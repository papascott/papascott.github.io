<p>comment on faz in english now weekly by papascott:<br />
i just noticed that the english edition of the frankfurter allgemeine (<a href="http://www.faz.com">http://www.faz.com</a>) is now updated only weekly instead of daily. too bad. they were often the only english-language source for current german news, and i'll miss them now that the election is heating up. i guess from now on i'll have to write my own news.<br />
