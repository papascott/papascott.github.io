<p>I'm happy. <a href="http://www.veseg.de/">SEG</a> has released new firmware for my Hollywood II DVD player that makes the region code setting configurable. I can now watch those DVDs I picked up in the States on my last couple of trips. Mama will be overjoyed (actually not; she and I don't have the same taste in movies).</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> If you can read German, <a href="http://www.dvdboard.de/forum/showthread.php?postid=228883#post228883">this entry</a> at dvdboard.de gives the details on changing the region setting.</p>
