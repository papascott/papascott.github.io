<p>IWon: <a href="http://money.iwon.com/jsp/nw/nwdt_rt.jsp?cat=USMARKET&src=201&feed=reu&section=news&news_id=reu-l29305613&date=20020129&alias=/alias/money/cm/nw">German opposition prepared to drop A400M court bid</a>. I don't really get this. Sure the government is trying to buy more planes than they budgeted. The opposition isn't opposed to the additional planes, they just want to embarass the government by reopening the budget. But involving the Constitutional Court?<br />
In the US, the government gets shut down all the time due to budget squabbles, and the Supreme Court never steps in.<br />
<a href="http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?x31207647">Update</a> The government has delayed the legal commitment for the additional planes until next year, and the oppostion has withdrawn their suit. In other words, both sides have declared victory and gone home.</p>
