<p>Maybe public life will get back to normal in the next day or two, now that the World Cup is over with Brazil defeating Germany 2-0. A just result. Germany played their best match so far, controlling midfield, but were unable to penetrate the box and left openings for Brazil at their own end. Yesterday's match for 3rd place (Turkey over South Korea 3-2) was more entertaining, but I guess our boys at <a href="http://www.worldcupblog.com">World Cup Blog</a> were asleep for that one.</p>
<p>(I'm still getting my templates here straightened out. Updating my daily archive is timing out before completion, and I'm trying to find a way around that. Until I do, the referals page will also be incomplete.)</p>
