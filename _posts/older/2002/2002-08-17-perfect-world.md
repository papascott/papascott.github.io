<p>Some moments the world seems perfect. Like last evening. When the weather is good, Hamburg is one of the nicest cities in the world. Of course, the weather is good only 10 days per year. But last night the weather was perfect. 25&deg;C. sunny. slight breeze. We took Christopher and his grandparents to the <a href="/2000/07/23/1313.php">Hamburger Dom</a>, where he rode the kiddie train at least 10 times. And driving home, the rush hour traffic had dispersed, the sun-roof was open, the radio was blasting, and I thought to myself that the moment was perfect. And it was.</p>
