<p>This is a sad day for humanity. Christopher can now crawl out the crib by himself. Nobody is safe anymore. Nobody.</p>
<p>My brother Steve turns 36 today... Happy Birthday!</p>
<p>On the Euro front, my last DM coins are now gone, and my last outdated currency is a single 50 DM note. <a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub=&#123;B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88&#125;&doc=&#123;0A8FA8E3-017E-4C42-8ED3-84D9DC903CC0&#125;">German banks are packed</a>, much more than expected, full with people willing to wait hours to change all the cash in their wallet at once and be done with it. </p>
<p>I thought on New Years Day that we were over jet lag, but yesterday both Christopher and I were very out of sorts for our first day of work/day care. Today is better.</p>
<p>Is it just me, or are <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a>/<a href="http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/">blogtracker</a> missing a lot of updated sites lately? For example. <a href="http://www.curry.com">Adam Curry</a> seems not to be showing up at all, and today's page flip for PapaScott was missed.</p>
