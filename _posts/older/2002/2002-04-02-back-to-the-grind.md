<p>Party's over, it's back to work today after the four-day weekend. One thing I'll be checking out at the office is the new Codeweavers <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/office/">CrossOver Office</a>. Our developers all run Linux, but need Windows for Notes and to view the occasional Word document (they don't need full MS Office licenses). We've been running <a href="http://www.citrix.com">Citrix</a> servers up to now, but that's expensive and they tend to max out at 25 users. If CrossOver works out, we might get a few dozen licenses to run Notes clients. And if <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio</a> will work with it, I'll get one for home.</p>
<p>Speaking of Citrix, I finally got the Citrix client to work on FreeBSD. I should have known, it's a <a href="http://www.freshports.org/port-description.php3?port=201">port</a>!</p>
