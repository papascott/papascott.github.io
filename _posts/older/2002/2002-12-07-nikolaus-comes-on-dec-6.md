<p>Yesterday was <a href="http://www.training-for-germany.de/tips99/tip11.htm">Nikolaus Day</a>, the morning when St. Nikolaus comes and fills your boots with chocolate (if you've been good), or just a branch (if you've been bad), or both (if you've been in-between). We forgot all about it, so we had no boots out for Christopher. We tried to make up for it by opening up one of his presents last evening, a double-decker train station for his wooden set. </p>
<p>Have I mentioned that all of his presents this year will come from E-Bay? Does that make us evil parents? </p>
<p>Also of note: Christopher used the toilet at home for the first time yesterday! That's no great accomplishment for him, he's been practicing at day care for over a week. It is an milestone for his parents, who finally got him to the bathroom in time. Yes, parents need toilet training, too.</p>
