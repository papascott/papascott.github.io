<p>FAZ: <a href="http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&doc={249DDD80-238E-4617-9CC4-485A5133E87B}">Bavarian Politicians Miffed Over Transrapid Funds</a> "The battle for federal funding for the Transrapid magnetic-levitation rail system intensified over the weekend after German Transportation Minister Kurt Bodewig announced that the lion's share of the planned  euro 2.3 billion ($2 billion) subsidy would go to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with far less going to a competing project in Bavaria." If the Bavarians hadn't built the Munich airport so damned far away from the city, they wouldn't need any Transrapid to get people there! (Disclaimer: Mama is a frequent flyer to Munich.)<br />
There's speculation that if the Dutch build a line from Amsterdam to Gronigen, that the Germans will then extend the line through Bremen to Hamburg. Now that would be nice!</p>
