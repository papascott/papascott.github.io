<p>Today is one of those days when we would sell our child to gypsies (er, I mean <a href="http://www.holocaust-trc.org/sinti.htm">Sinti and Roma</a>) if they would offer us a price. Any price. Although I'm sure with his parent-beating, hair-pulling, tantrum-thrhowing, sand-tossing, I-have-no-idea-what-I-want antics, they'd bring him right back and demand a refund.</p>
