<p>PapaScott Headquarters is moving starting today... from the upstairs office to the basement guest room. The office is just too tight on space for both me and Mama to work and for Christopher to play at the same time. And a wireless card should enable us to continue to share our Internet connection... at least I don't think there's too much steel and concrete in the way. Otherwise <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Mama will have to do without,</span> er, I mean I'll have to run a cable to connect the rooms.</p>
<p>Anyway, first step is to move 4 bookshelves with about 20 m of <a href="http://www.ora.com">animal books</a> (and a few others) down 2 flights of stairs.</p>
