<p>FUD to the left of us, FUD to the right. FUD all around us, it's an ugly sight. That's how it was at work today. The <i>Betriebsrat</i> is going to ask for some assurance that those who agree to pay cuts won't be laid off at the end of the quarter. I don't expect management to give a concrete response, but in this case, even no response is a very understandable response, whether what we are being asked to give up is just a drop in the bucket or a drop on a red-hot stone.</p>
