<p>No English link yet, but the HypoVereinsbank in Munich has agreed to buy Kirch's share of the Axel Springer Verlag for &euro;1BN, keeping the troubled media firm solvent for the moment. Rupert Murdoch has to wait for his takeover of Kirch until this fall, when Murdoch has option to sell back his share of Premiere World to Kirch for close to &euro;2BN.</p>
