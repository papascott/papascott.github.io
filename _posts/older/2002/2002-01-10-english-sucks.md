<p>Python author <a href="http://diveintomark.weblogger.com/">Mark Pilgrim</a> <a href="http://diveintomark.weblogger.com/2002/01/10">explains a pluralization script</a> he posted... "(W)ords that we borrowed wholesale (from Latin)... are generally problematic, as it's difficult to tell (without simply listing them) which ones follow Latin rules and which do not. For instance, the plural of "radius" is "radii", but the plural of "genius" is "geniuses". "Consortium" becomes "consortia", but "premium" becomes "premiums". English sucks." Actually, English doesn't suck... it's just that there's more than one way to do it, so it's more like perl than python. For a more python-like language, try German! ";->"</p>
