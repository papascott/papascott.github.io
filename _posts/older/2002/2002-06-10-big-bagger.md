<p>The highlight of Christopher's day is  the huge backhoe blocking the street downhill from our house, parked for the night. (So I guess someone is really going to build in that horse pasture.) He's taken me down to look at it 3 times already this evening, and now that he's asleep, he's probably dreaming of driving the big backhoe when he grows up.</p>
