<p><a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20021114">Garrett reminded</a> me and <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/002791.shtml#002791">Karl</a> of <a href="http://www.retroweb.com/prisoner.html">The Prisoner</a>, which I haven't seen in ages (not since I've been in Germany, I've never heard it mentioned here.) Back when I was in high school, the local public TV station would broadcast it Sunday nights right after Monty Python. Extremely appropriate. And I see the complete series is available on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004U8MR">DVD</a>.</p>
