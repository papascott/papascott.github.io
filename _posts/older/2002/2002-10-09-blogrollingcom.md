<p><a href="http://blo.gs">blo.gs</a> has been slow lately. I've noticed a bunch of people now using <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com/">blogrolling.com</a>. It looks like they have added a lot of features that I like, such as chronological sorting and an RSS feed. They update more often, and they seem to have no restriction on how often I pull the feed. So I'm giving them a try. I'm importing their HTML directly for now, rather than groking RSS, but it still doesn't look bad at all.</p>
