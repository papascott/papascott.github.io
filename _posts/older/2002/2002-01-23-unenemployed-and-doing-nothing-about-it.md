<p>This is was quick 2 paragraphs in the <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/contents/ha/news/politik/html/220102/01ARB226.HTM">local paper</a>: a study by the Employment Ministry found that of Germany's 4.3 million unemployed, 25% are making no efforts whatsoever to find work. On the other hand, 50% are making 'intensive' efforts to find a job.</p>
