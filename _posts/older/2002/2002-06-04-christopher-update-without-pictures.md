<p>I finally managed to get our Nikon CoolPix to the repair shop today. Hopefully in a couple of weeks we'll once again be able to provide anxious grandparents with Christopher pictures. His vocabulary is expanding by leaps and bounds, especially with respect to animals and heavy machinery. But airplanes are still tops on his list of favorite things.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we're losing another colleague at work (they're buying a house in the country and she wants to have another baby), and we've elected an elections board, the first step on a long road in installing a worker's council (which seems to entail all of the bureaucracy and internal politics of a union, but without the dues).</p>
