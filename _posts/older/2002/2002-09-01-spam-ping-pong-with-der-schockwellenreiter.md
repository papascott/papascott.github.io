<p>Sometimes spam can be funny. A few weeks ago, I got a Klez-infected spam  forged from  'der  at shockwellenreiter.de'. I thought that was funny so I told <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/">Der Schockwellenreiter</a> about it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, my Spam Bouncer caught a Klez-infected bounced mail. Someone had forged <em>my</em> address in a spam to 'der  at shockwellenreiter.de', and Jörg either manually or automatically bounced it ('X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.482)'), but it bounced to me and not to the Klez-infected spammer (in Russia? 'Received: from mx5.mail.ru (mx5.mail.ru [194.67.57.15])...). </p>
<p>So now I guess it's Jörg's turn again to spam me.</p>
