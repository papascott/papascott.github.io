<p>I haven't found an English link  yet, but the main national story today is a study of government 'Arbeitsämter' (Employment Offices) by the federal 'Rechnungshof'. In the study, some 70% of job referrals claimed by the Arbeitsämter were 'incorrect', meaning the job seeker found the job by himself. So if the Arbeitsämter are not finding jobs for the unemployed, what <i>are</i> they doing?<br />
<b>Update</b> FAZ has the story this morning: <a href="http://faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&amp;doc={75F0D98B-CB94-4A2F-9152-F524DC646757}">Auditors Say Federal Labor Office Falsified Statistics</a><br />
<b>Update</b> BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1803000/1803966.stm">German jobless total tops four million</a>, a statistic which is unfortunately correct.</p>
