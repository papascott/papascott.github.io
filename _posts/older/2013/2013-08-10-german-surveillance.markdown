<p>All the talk of the "NSA Affair" in Germany reminds of a time when we were definitely spied upon by the German government.</p>
<p>In the early '90s we were visiting a relative in Bonn, which was still the German capital. We were exploring the government district and were admiring the <em>Bundeskanzleramt</em>, the Chancellor's office, occupied at the time by Helmut Kohl. We were outside the entrance gate, and behind the <em>Bundeskanzleramt</em> was an office building with the distinctive 3-pointed Mercedes star.</p>
<p>One of us mentioned how utterly appropriate it was that a symbol of German industry was looking down upon the Chancellor's office when suddenly the loudspeaker on the gate crackled.</p>
<p>"The Star of Bethlehem."</p>
<p>That was the absolute highlight of our trip to Bonn.</p>
