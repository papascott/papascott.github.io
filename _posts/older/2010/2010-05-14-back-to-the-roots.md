<p>Christopher and I are spending the Ascension holiday weekend alone. Frauke and her brothers have taken their mother on a short trip to her mother's birthplace, organized for her 80th birthday. I wrote a bit <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/05/08/determination/">about her for 75th birthday</a>.</p>
<p>She was born in a village in what at the time as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margraviate_of_Brandenburg">Mark Brandenburg</a>, and now is western Poland. She was a miller's daughter, and the house and the mill pond still exist. I mentioned <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/08/tel-aviv/">her last visit 10 years ago</a>, but this time she can show the place her children. They've been invited by the present residents for coffee this afternoon.</p>
<p>This is an occasion for immediate family, so Christopher and I stayed behind. I'm sure we'll have a chance to see the place for ourselves sometime in the future. We're keeping ourselves well occupied... yesterday we saw the <a href="http://www.tut-ausstellung.com/en/hamburg/the-great-tutanchamun-must-see-exhibition.html">King Tut exhibit in Hamburg</a> and experienced Avatar in 3D, and have further adventures planned for today.</p>
