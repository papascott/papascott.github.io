My vote is already in and counted. If you don't know how to vote from overseas, the <a href="https://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/">Overseas Vote Foundation</a> can help you get started. You might still have a chance to get in your vote for tomorrow, or at the very least, be set to go for the next election. The procedure is different from state to state, but they can help you out.</p>
