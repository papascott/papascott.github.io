<p><a href="http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/produktfinder.html#/veggieburger"><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/McD_PM_20100216_Veggieburger_180x103.jpg" alt="McD_PM_20100216_Veggieburger_180x103.jpg" border="0" width="180" height="103" align="right" /></a>I'm a bit late on the uptake here, since it's been on the menu for over 2 weeks now, but the best <a href="/archives/2009/10/21/marketing-non-secrets/">Marketing Non-Secret</a> we heard about last October was the <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/produktfinder.html#/veggieburger">Veggieburger</a> which has now debuted in Germany.</p>
<p>There are a lot of vegetarians in Germany, and several years ago McDonald's offered a larger vegetarian burger, the Gemüse-Mac, which had a small but loyal fan base. However, it just didn't sell well enough to fit into the production system. Either they were made to order, meaning you had to wait 6 minutes at a minimum, or the sandwiches were held well over the 10 minute holding limit, and you can imagine how that tasted (not good).</p>
<p>In the meantime McDonald's here has implemented a made-to-order system (BOP in McJargon) for deep-fried products, so we can now better offer a fresh but low-selling product. And the market for vegetarian sandwich is still there and growing, particularly among young women, and vegetarians cannot live on salads and french fries alone.</p>
<p>The new Veggieburger now headlines <a href="/archives/2009/11/12/marketing-non-secrets-3/">the relaunched SMS line</a>, along with the Cheeseburger and the Chickenburger. The deep-fried patty is based on potatoes, with carrots, red bell peppers, corn and onions, with a creamy sauce, lettuce and cheese. It's not a low-calorie sandwich. The calories per 100g (250) is the same as the Cheeseburger, but the Veggieburger is 20% heavier so has more total calories (360 vs. 300). It tastes alright, I think, although when I have 300 calories to spare on a snack I'd personally take a Cheeseburger. :-)</p>
<p>As businesspeople we're happy with how the product is starting out. Sales are in the neighborhood of the Hamburger, and it's attracting a target group that wouldn't be so inclined to visit us. The price of 1.10 means we've broken the 1 barrier, and we can see how the guests react.</p>
<p>There are no TV spots yet for the Veggieburger, but it's pictured briefly in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGzdP41MKrw">this cute spot</a> for SMS. Even for non-German speakers, I think the dialog is clear (the father is going to McDonald's and asks if she wants anything). Don't think the spot would fly in the States, though... :-)</p>
