<p><a href="/archives/2005/12/04/in-front-of-the-dakota/">Five years ago</a> I wrote this:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/8898300/?pageid=rs.NewsArchive&amp;pageregion=mainRegion&amp;rnd=1133704411142&amp;has-player=true" title="RollingStone.com: John Lennon : Lennon Lives Forever : News">It was 25 years ago</a> <strike>Wednesday</strike> Thursday that John Lennon was killed. Has it really been that long? It's an event (like the <a href="/archives/2003/01/28/on-this-day-challenger/">Challenger explosion</a>) that I remember vividly and that changed how I felt about myself and the world. I had just started college, I was working at the student radio station at the U of M. Ihad the Sunday morning shift, so I was on the air for the world wide minute of radio silence 6 days after his death.

<p>Good thing my blog has a search function, otherwise I might have written pretty much the same thing today, except now it's been 30 years. And now I can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n73GFvAyIjs">link to the broadcast</a> where I first heard the news, from Howard Cosell on <a href="http://nfl.fanhouse.com/2010/12/08/monday-night-football-today-isnt-close-to-what-it-once-was/">Monday Night Football</a>, Miami vs New England, December 8, 1980. "It's just a football game."</p>
