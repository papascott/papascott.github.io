<p>Time to bring PapaScott into the new decade (if you believe decades begin in '0 years and not '1 years, that is). I was going to write about how this is the first new year in business that we weren't rushing around with new things, but I guess it's a bit late for that now.</p>
<p>We got caught on the edge of the snow storm that <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,671186,00.html">hit northern Germany</a> for the weekend, making things really bad on the Baltic coast (<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-50586.html">Spiegel Online has some pictures</a>). Only about 10 inches of snow, but the wind made the roads no fun yesterday. School was cancelled in all counties near us, so Christopher gets a snow day today.</p>
<p>The German media doesn't know much about broadcasting weather warnings. Every podunk American local TV station has weather radar that shows the exact location of incoming storms. Here they can announce SHOCK HORROR DRAMA SNOW DISASTER is on the way, but can't say where, exactly. We got better storm information from a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/regenradar/id293654490?mt=8">free iPhone app</a> than from the public TV networks we pay for.</p>
