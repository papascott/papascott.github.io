<p>Why PapaScott?</p>
<p>The oldest remaining shards of what would be become PapaScott date back 10 years to <a href="/blogger99.html">August 1999</a> and were posted with <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, a shiny new technology at the time.</p>
<p>In 1999 we were pregnant with Christopher, and we were calling each other cute names like MamaMaus and PapaScott. And when I <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/05/it-worked/">started</a> a site on the brand spaning new <a href="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1999/12/08/editthispagecom.html">edithispage.com</a>, it didn't take long for me to start calling it PapaScott, even after Christopher was <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/27/christopher-ryan-hanson/">born</a> later that month. The name fits, even today.</p>
<p>So why PapaScott? Why not?</p>
