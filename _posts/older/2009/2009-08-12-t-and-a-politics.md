<p>I'm sorry, but when I saw these two posters yesterday, I knew they just were begging to be combined in a single post. The poster on the right has managed to hit a taboo-trifecta (race, nudity, homosexualtiy) with maybe even more taboos I haven't noticed (bad nail polish?).</p>
<p>Two great tastes that go great... no, I won't finish that thought.</p>
<p>(Left: Berlin CDU Bundestag candidate Vera Lengsfeld, "We have more to offer", seen at <a href="http://50percentdna.blogspot.com/2009/08/merkel.html">50% of my DNA</a>. Right: Local Green poster in Kaarst, NRW, "The only reason to vote black", seen at <a href="http://www.amiexpat.com/2009/08/11/racist-tasteless-or-provocative/">AmiExpat</a>)</p>
