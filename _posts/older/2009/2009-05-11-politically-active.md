<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3522786088" title="View 'photo-6' on Flickr.com"><img src="4.static.flickr.com/3364/3522786088_e4f4621b8f_m.jpg" alt="photo-6" border="0" width="240" height="180" align="right" /></a>In a moment of weakness after a week of working middle-shifts, Frauke agreed to take Christopher for an outing this past weekend... only after promising the trip did she see where he wanted to go: to a demonstration in Hannover against policy of the current education ministry. That's a cause we can agree with, but taking up an entire Saturday with a bus trip to Hannover? And, yes, Christopher insisted on taking the bus.</p>

I did however bring to two of them to the bus pick-up point at 9:30 Saturday morning. We managed to get Christopher to compromise on taking the bus there, but to take the train back.</p>
<p>And they had a good crowd. 10000 demonstrators (mostly teachers and students) <a href="http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/10.000-demonstrieren-gegen-Schulpolitik">protested plans to impose a shortened Abitur in the "Gesamtschule"</a> (combined schools, like we hope to have built in Jesteburg) and the general lack of funding for education.</p>

They were back by 4 pm, giving Christopher plenty of time to mow the lawn before dark and letting Frauke relax a little bit on her day off and enjoy an outdoor cook-out by yours truly. </p>
<p>The following day was Mother's Day, and Frauke celebrated by doing something she loves... planting flowers, in this case at her restaurant at Hamburg Winsener Strasse. </p>
