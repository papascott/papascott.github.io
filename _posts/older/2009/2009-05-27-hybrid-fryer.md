<p>Just to show that we not only make <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/04/15/stripes-from-paris">sexy investments with French models</a> (not to be confused with promotions with <a href="http://www.abendzeitung.de/leute/108462">German top models</a>), this morning at our restaurant in Dibbersen we installed the new <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/04/15/stripes-from-paris">low-oil-volume (LOV) fryer</a> that we've been planning for over a year, replacing a double vat with a new triple vat.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3570794066" title="View 'Hybrid Fryer' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3641/3570794066_cebd1281e2.jpg" alt="Hybrid Fryer" border="0" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Astute readers will note that this is not the Frymaster model we were considering last year, but is instead manufactured by <a href="http://www.hennypenny.com/">Henny Penny</a>. The principle is however the same. The low-oil-volume vat holds just half the volume of a traditional fryer, so we only have to heat half as much oil. To maintain the quality of the oil, the fryer automatically filters the vat after 12 cooking cycles (normally a vat is filtered once daily), and tops itself off when the vat starts to run low.</p>
<p>Think of the fryer as just like a hybrid car... the tank is smaller and we have to fill it less often, so we save energy and money. We're looking for both good performance and good gas (er, I mean oil) mileage.</p>
