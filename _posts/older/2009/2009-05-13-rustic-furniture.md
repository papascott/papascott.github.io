<p>Seeing <a href="http://www.martinisfortwo.com/2009/05/movin-on-up.html">Diane's report</a> of moving her "super-sized, American-made furniture" from Mannheim to Barcelona reminded me that today was a minor expat milestone for us. Today we got rid of the last remaining bits of American furniture we had brought with us back in 1990. It was a bulky oak dining room set that Germans would politely describe as "rustic". We had tried selling it a few years ago, but found no takers. It's been in the basement since then, and as part of our long-term 2009 basement project it landed on the pile of "Sperrm&uuml;ll" that was to be picked up today.</p>
<p>(As an aside, how would one refer to "Sperrm&uuml;ll" pickup in English? My father would call it the "dray service", but that's a quaint 19th century term that's a bit of an inside joke in our family. "Junk pickup" &agrave; la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_and_Son">Sanford &amp; Son</a> maybe?)</p>
<p>However, the furniture will not end up at the dump. The table was picked up a couple weeks ago by a flea-market collector whom we had called to take a look at our stuff. And the 4 chairs disappeared from the pile on the street yesterday, one day before today's pickup. Sperrm&uuml;ll moves in mysterious ways.</p>
