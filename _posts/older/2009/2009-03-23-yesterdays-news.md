<p>Yesterday morning we attended a rally in support of a new school in Jesteburg. I got recruited as a drummer, we were at the front of the march, and the drummers ended up in <a href="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/abendblatt-demo.pdf" title="abendblatt_demo.pdf">full color in the Hamburger Abendblatt</a>. That's me with the white cap and the grim expression on the far left. <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2009/03/23/1095300.html">The story</a> (without photos) is also on the Abendblatt website.</p>
