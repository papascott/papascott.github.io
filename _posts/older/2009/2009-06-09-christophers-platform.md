<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3611248234" title="View 'IMG_0164' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3313/3611248234_6ca0540c2e_s.jpg" alt="IMG_0164" border="0" width="75" height="75" align="right" /></a>All the news about elections (European and upcoming German) reminded Christopher of two things. One, because of his dual citizenship, he can vote twice as often as either of his parents. Secondly, if he were to run for German Chancellor*, he would campaign for the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>More schools</li>
<li>More help for victims of natural disaster, and research to prevent such disasters</li>
<li>Energy conservation, less oil and coal, more wind and solar</li>
<li>Abolish war</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds like a solid platform, but the devil is going to be in the details.</p>
<p>*Yes, we realize he previously <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/11/05/yes-we-can-in-2036/">announced his candidacy for the US Presidency</a>. We'll issue a statement when we know which is correct.</p>
