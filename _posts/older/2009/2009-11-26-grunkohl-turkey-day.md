<p>We've never gotten in the habit of celebrating American Thanksgiving here in Germany, but as I <a href="http://twitter.com/papascott/status/6079791888">mentioned on Twitter</a> today, by coincidence we are going out for a traditional meal this Thanksgiving evening. The local <em>Wirtschaftsrunde</em> (chamber of commerce, sort of) is holding their annual <em>Gr&uuml;nkohl</em> dinner. I've never had it, and I suspect that Frauke is taking me along to the dinner not just to keep her company, but so that we can split one portion and she only has to eat half as much.</p>
<p>According to the Internets, <em>Gr&uuml;nkohl</em> translates as "curly kale" and is a north German dish often served with <em>Pinkel</em> (small sausages) (no, not <a href="http://dict.leo.org/?search=pinkeln"><em>pinkeln</em></a>, that's something else). Judging from this <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr&uuml;nkohl#Eigenschaften">picture from Wikipedia</a>, the vegetable content of the meal is actually quite small...</p>

<p>Wish us luck, or at least <em>Guten Appetit!</em></p>
<p><strong>Update after the fact:</strong> The <em>Grünkohl</em> was in fact very tasty! <a href="/archives/2009/11/26/grunkohl-turkey-day/#comment-40308">Details in the comments below</a>.</p>
