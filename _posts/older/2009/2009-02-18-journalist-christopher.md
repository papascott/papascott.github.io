<p>While helping (well, actually watching) me clean out our basement, Christopher discovered Frauke's typewriter (which he immediately dubbed an "antique") and asked if he could try it out. This evening we let him at it.</p>

<p>After experimenting a bit, he put in a fresh sheet of paper and spent over an hour preparing a "report" on snakes, with lists of species of snakes, what they eat, what eats them, and where they are found. </p>
<p>Afterwards he declared that, unlike us, he does not need a computer to print things out, he can just do it himself.</p>
