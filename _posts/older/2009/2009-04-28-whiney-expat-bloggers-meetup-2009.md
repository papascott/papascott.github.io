<p>This year's Whiney Expat Bloggers Meetup will be September 5th and 6th in Munich.</p>
<p>Selecting the place and date was about as long and complex as selecting a presidential candidate, but that's just how we Americans are. We're now working on an agenda.</p>
<p>This year we have an online forum at <a href="http://www.expatbloggersingermany.com/">http://www.expatbloggersingermany.com/</a> to help organize the meetup. Access is password only, but any blogger (does Twitter count? or a GeoCities page?) can apply, and non-bloggers can get read-only access.</p>
