<p>If&nbsp;Christopher were an experienced fisherman, he'd tell the world he caught this crappie on Lac qui Parle Lake last weekend. But he's too honest for that. We didn't get a bite during our short time on the ice, which was cut short on account of an incoming snow storm. This fish was caught by our host the night before. Thanks to my brother's friend Gary and his family for having us out.</p>
