<p>We had a chance to visit the new restaurant on Sunday. There's now security watching over the site, but he was nice enough to let us in for some pictures. Here's the front counter and kitchen area.</p>

<p>Here's the lobby. The pipes coming out of the floor will be McCaf√©.</p>

<p>Looking towards the front door. Behind the walls to the left will be the restrooms and recycling room.</p>
