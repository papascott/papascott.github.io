<p>OK, it's not really bacon, just low-fat diced ham, but this recipe from our <a href="http://www.myline24.de/">My Line fitness program</a> has become our favorite way to eat Brussels sprouts, even as a main dish! The original recipe is metric, the American equivalents are approximate.</p>
<p>500 g (1 lb) Brussels sprouts<br />
1 onion, chopped<br />
1 Tsp olive oil<br />
50 g (2 oz) diced ham (3% fat)<br />
dash soy or Maggi sauce<br />
75 ml (1/3 cup) broth<br />
50 ml (1/4 cup) dry white wine<br />
a pinch grated nutmeg<br />
1-1/2 Tsp low-fat cooking cream<br />
1 stem fresh marjoram, chopped</p>
<p>Wash Brussels sprouts, steam for 7 minutes. Heat olive oil in a frying pan, lightly brown the diced ham, add onions and fry until translucent. Stir in Brussels sprouts. Add broth and white wine, cover, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, nutmeg and cooking cream, sprinkle with fresh marjoram, and serve immediately.</p>
