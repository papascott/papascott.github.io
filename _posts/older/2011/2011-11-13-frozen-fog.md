<p>I was impressed by the view from our back window this morning. The lawn was frozen and the fog was thick and this leafless tree seemed to be spiting it all. It's November, and the damp cold should come as no surprise. The heat is on and we've started lighting the wood stove in the evening. The holidays will be here before we know it, and we're talking about next year like it's just around the corner instead of the distant future. </p>
