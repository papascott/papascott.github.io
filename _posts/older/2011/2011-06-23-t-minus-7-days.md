<p>The front door already looks pretty good.</p>

<p>The lobby needs a little work, though.</p>

<p>And this is going to be our McCaf√©?</p>

<p>I'll spare you the pictures from the kitchen. To us it looks like total chaos. But the construction experts tell us everything looks good for a week before opening. We're crossing our fingers until Monday, when we officially take over the site.</p>
<p>Let's take a look outside. We have a nice Playland for the kids to crawl through. Just yesterday it was still packed on pallets on a truck.</p>

<p>And it's always good to have asphalt in the Drive-Thru lane before the cars come.</p>

<p>But it seems the general contractor has some understanding for our logo. That's a very good sign!</p>

<p>But I almost forgot... the best thing is, our electric drive Smart has arrived. It will look better once we paste a bunch of Golden Arches on it! But we'll show it off on Sunday at our local Stadtlauf (city run).</p>
