<p>Forgive me, readers, for I have sinned. It's been over five weeks since my last post</p>
<p>Our summer "vacation" was a busy as we suspected it would be. The restaurant in Rade, the truck stop store without a truck stop, is as busy as we hoped it would be. The self-serve "Easy Order" kiosks are in but are not being frequented that much yet (around 3% of guests). I suspect most people walk by not knowing what they are. Our first store in Dibbersen has been holding its own, down just a bit from last year despite having the brand new store just a few km away. </p>
<p>However it was our store in Harburg that gave us the nicest surprise. A couple of weeks ago we found our neighboring Burger King had subtly changed.</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/non-bk.jpg" alt="Non bk" border="0" width="500" height="373" style="float:right;" /></p>
<p>It had become a non-Burger King. Apparently BK had cancelled their franchise. The restaurant is still open as a generic burger joint, but it doesn't look open and we're getting a surprise plus. Now we just need to get staffed to match.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we had sent our son to my parents in Minnesota for 3 weeks, after the success of his Easter voyage. He arrived just at the peak of the heat wave (110°F), but it was cooler at the lake and he pretty much caught all the sunfish he could get (final count over 60). I flew over for the last few days of his visit to catch up with my folks and bring him home. It was nice to get a couple of days of sanity time. </p>
<p>Today school starts, our son is in the 6th grade, and our schedule gets back to "normal", whatever normal turns out to be this fall.</p>
