<p>We've been busy this month, as usual. When you have to the stress of owning a business, then the holiday stress that comes in December is almost relaxing by comparison.</p>
<p>But now the the holidays are almost here, we have 4 days to celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>Christmas Eve</strong> we'll to try avoid any last minute grocery shopping. We've have a simple dinner of Ragout Fin, then take Oma to the afternoon service at St. Michaelis in Hamburg, then return home for cookies, presents, and <em>Gl√ºhwein</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas Day</strong> is relatively quiet. No guests, just some fondue in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Christmas Day</strong> we're cooking goose for all the in-laws! Big Petersen Christmas party at our house. Presents and music galore (back in October the kids recorded a couple of songs for Oma which my brother-in-law has professionally mixed).</p>
<p><strong>3rd Christmas Day</strong> is Christopher's birthday. We're taking him out on the town for the new Sherlock Holmes movie, a last walk through the Hamburg Christmas market, and dinner at the roller-coaster restaurant <a href="http://www.schwerelos-zeitlos.de/"><em>Schwerelos &amp; Zeitlos</em></a> (Weightless and Timeless), where your meal rides on rails to your table. We'll see how that works.</p>
<p>Then it will be the 28th already, nearly time to get ready for New Year's Eve. Happy Holidays, no matter how many days you celebrate!</p>
