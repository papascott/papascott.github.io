<p>We arrived to find a <em>maître d'</em> at the door, a table set in a quiet corner with candles, flowers and tablecloth, a printed menu, and a hostess ready to take our order.</p>

<p>We chose to split the special of the day, the <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/produktfinder.html#/steakhouse_classic">Steakhouse Classic</a> in the current promotion as a McMenu with 2 side salads, a side order of Chicken Sticks, and a vintage 2012 Cola Light (Cola Zero for me) to drink. We passed on desert, deciding instead on an Espresso Macchiato to round off the meal.</p>
<p>All in all it was a very nice gesture and great fun, and many thanks to our crew for the idea and the invitation. However, it got us thinking: maybe other guests would enjoy an exclusive, fun and special candlelight dinner at our McDonald's? Maybe it's something we could offer…</p>
