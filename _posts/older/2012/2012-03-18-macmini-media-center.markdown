<p>For my 50th birthday, I decided to splurge a bit on my present. After all, you only turn 50 once (although admittedly one could say the same for 49 or 51). I decided to get myself a fancy DVD player.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/papascott/image/upload/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/macmini2011silver.jpg"  alt="Macmini2011silver"  border="0"  width="480"  height="270" /></p>
<p>As you notice, it's not really a DVD player. For one thing, there's no place to insert a DVD. For another, it's actually a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">MacMini</a> computer with full HDMI output.</p>
<p>I had made a couple of attempts before to attach a media player to our TV. The latest attempt was a WD TV Live, to which you attach an external hard disk or connect to network shares. The user interface leaves much to be desired, and networking for us (over a powerline interface) worked hit or miss at best.</p>
<p>The monkey wrench in the works is that we still have an analog TV, a 10-year-old 32" Samsung I can barely lift. We're going to renovate our living room Real Soon Nowâ„¢ (first intended for 2010, now possibly in 2014), and we'll get a new TV when we have that done. The Samsung has only 2 SCART inputs, which makes attaching multiple devices rather difficult. Given the analog TV, the HDMI output goes to waste (for now). All our video is standard definition, anyway, so attaching a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B002CBN81S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=papascott-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B002CBN81S">HDMI-to-analog converter</a> doesn't degrade anything.</p>
<p>A pleasant surprise with the Mac Mini is that networking over powerline works just fine. I can control it from my MacBookPro with <a href="http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/">Remote Desktop</a>, it can stream files from elsewhere on our home network just fine, I can rip DVDs to it from other computers or start <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a> on it to convert ripped DVDs to more useful formats. To start movies in the living room we've got a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-roeu/remotes/universal-remotes/devices/8717">Harmony One</a> remote that can be paired with the Mac Mini.</p>
<p>As for the software, I knew in advance I'd be wanting <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/">Plex</a>, which is so cool I'll be writing a whole separate post about that.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> There are a number of good tutorials on setting up a Mac Mini Meia Center. For me a good starting point was the <a href="http://www.yousephtanha.com/blog/2011/02/09/mac-mini-media-center-project-part-1/">Mac Mini Media Center Project</a> series by <a href="http://www.yousephtanha.com/blog/">Youseph Tanha</a>.</p>
