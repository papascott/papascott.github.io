<p><strong>I don't get 5 weeks vacation.</strong> Or 6. Or 4. In Germany there's a <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesurlaubsgesetz"><em>Bundesurlaubsgesetz</em></a> that regulates vacation time for employees. The legal minimum is 4 weeks per year, although most industries have contracts that call for more. Our employees get 5 to 6 weeks vacation, depending on longevity, as set in our <a href="http://www.bundesverband-systemgastronomie.de/ueber-den-bds/tarifabschluss.html"><em>Manteltarifvertrag</em></a>.</p>
<p>But as a business owner you're on your own. And our business tends to be busiest when other people are enjoying themselves (weekends, school vacations and holidays). We tend to take a couple days off time and again rather than a bunch of days in one piece. The work is always waiting for us when we get back.</p>
<p>Next week, though, we are heading to Minnesota for a couple of weeks. The cell phones are staying home.</p>
