<p>(Note: the name of the series has been updated to more accurately reflect the spirit in which it's intended.)</p>
<p><strong>I don't miss American food.</strong> It seems every expat blogger goes through a phase where they're missing some type of food from home, usually something heavily processed and extremely unhealthy. Comfort food. Some expats never snap out of it.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because our business is food (my wife says to add that you're all welcome to buy all the comfort food you want from us!), or because I learned economics and understand supply and demand, but I was never all that emotionally attached to food from home. If there's something you miss, learn to make it (or a close approximation) yourself.</p>
<p>And you can find peanut butter and Oreos at pretty much any German supermarket these days.</p>
