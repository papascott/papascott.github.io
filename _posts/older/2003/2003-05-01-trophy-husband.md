<p>I'd show my wife this Fortune article on <a title="Fortune.com - America's Most Powerful Women in Business - Trophy Husbands" href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/women/articles/0,15114,370514,00.html">stay-at-home husbands</a> who make it possible for their wives to pursue high-level careers, but she'd probably ask me why I don't have breakfast ready for her when she gets up. (via <a title="Ministry of Propaganda - 01/May/2003: Role reversal" href="http://www.ministryofpropaganda.co.uk/oldpropaganda/00000359.shtml">Ministry of Propaganda</a>)</p>
<p>By the way, as I predicted yesterday, she did spend the entire day today behind the counter at her new location, which was very busy.</p>
