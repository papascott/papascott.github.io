<p>Wouldn't you know. As soon as the weather gets warm (above freezing) and Mama's off on her first trip of the year, I get the flu. Nothing serious, the usual headache and sore throat that ibuprofin and pinot grigio can handle in the short run, but enough to come home early. My co-workers don't like working with folks who are infectious. Of course, Christopher doesn't issue sick days, but there's always the <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005UQZ6">Kleine Eisb√§r</a> to keep him occupied.</p>
<p>No, Alwin, I'm not serious about mixing OTC drugs with alcohol.</p>
