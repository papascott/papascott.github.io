<p>To follow up on <a href="/2003/05/10/2224.php">Smoking for Health Care</a>, it's being reported today that the proposed &euro;1 cigarette tax <a href="http://www.heute.t-online.de/ZDFheute/artikel/21/0,1367,WIRT-0-2048021,00.html">will not be imposed all at once</a> on  January 1, but will instead be introduced in stages of 40, 30 and 30 cents. The government otherwise fears a drastic drop in cigarette use and an impact on expected revenue from the new tax.</p>
<p>That's refreshing honesty, albeit a bit cynical. The government would rather have smokers die than quit. Just make sure you buy a few cartons extra before you go.</p>
