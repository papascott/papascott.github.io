<p>Christopher's favorite picture right now is this poster of the steamship <a title="Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia - - Deutschland" href="http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/ships/html/sh_026600_deutschland2.htm">Deutschland</a>, which we have hanging in our hallway for obvious sentimental reasons. Every evening on his way to bed, he has to sit on the stairs for 2 or 3 minutes and admire the <em>big ship</em>, with four <em>smokestacks</em> and an <em>anchor</em>. </p>
<p>The Hamburg-Amerika Linie is today called <a href="http://www.hapag-lloyd.com/">Hapag-Lloyd</a>, and they still sail ships. And fly tourist jets (although they recently sold the airline to <a href="http://www.tui.com/en">TUI</a>). Christopher would approve of both lines of business.</p>
