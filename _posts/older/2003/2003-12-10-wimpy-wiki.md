<p>Having been inspired by Simon Williston's post on using a wiki for <a title="Simon Willison: Simpler content managment" href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/12/05/simple">simpler content managment</a>, I've set up a <a title="PapaScottWiki" href="https://www.papascott.de/tavi/">read-only wiki</a> of my own as a public notebook for my work. There's not much there yet, but maybe I can all my technical-oriented posts there, thus saving this space for important stuff like Christopher pictures.</p>
