<p>The Abendblatt had an article today on how <a title=""Komm rein und finde raus"" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/09/18/209322.html">English ad slogans are not understood by German consumers. Of the 12 slogans they listed, only 2 were understood by more the half the readers, and the median was 25%. A number of people thought they understood the slogans, but actually did not (the Douglas slogan 'Come in and find out' was incorrectly thought to mean 'Come in and find the exit'). The worst undersood slogans were Mitsubishi's 'Drive Alive' ('Survive the trip'), Siemens' 'Be inspired', and RWE's 'One Group. Multi Utilities', to which even a native English speaker can only say 'Huh?'</p>
