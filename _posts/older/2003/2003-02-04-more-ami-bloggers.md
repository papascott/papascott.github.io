<p>After assuming for the past three years that I was the only American blogger in Germany, in the past few days I've discovered two others. One is <a href="http://amiland.blogspot.com/">Amiland</a>, by Anonymous (though I'd guess from the content (s)he either writes or translates professionally). The other is <a href="http://rwallace.blogspot.com/">Ground Plums &amp; Gun Smoke</a>, by Rick Wallace from the Baumholder Military Community in Rhineland-Pfalz. So Armin Grewe now has couple more entries for his <a href="http://www.ministryofpropaganda.co.uk/blogging-abroad.shtml">Blogging Abroad</a> page.</p>
