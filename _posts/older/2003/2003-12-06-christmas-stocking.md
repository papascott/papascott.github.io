<p>Grandma sent Christopher a Christmas stocking. Since he's not familiar with American Christmas customs, he thought he had to wear it.</p>
<p>We'll set it out for the <a href="http://www.training-for-germany.de/tips99/tip11.htm">Nikolaus</a> tonight. He's coming to our house a day late this year, and he's been informed to expect a stocking instead of a shoe. (The exact date doesn't matter, since Christopher is already a few days ahead with his Advent calendar.)</p>
