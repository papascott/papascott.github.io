<p>As happens <a href="/2000/02/09">year</a> <a href="/2001/02/09">after</a> <a href="/2002/02/09">year</a>, today I turn another year older. We're spending the afternoon baking muffins, since my co-workers will be expecting treats from me tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Update</b> It was not really my intent to fish for birthday greetings, but thanks for all the well wishes! In appreciation, here's our muffin recipe (my apologies for the European units).</p>
<p><b>Mama's Banana-almond-chocolate Muffins</b><br />
150 g (1-1/2 cups) flour type 405 (all-purpose)<br />
100 g (1-1/4 cups) slivered almonds<br />
2 tsp baking powder<br />
1 pinch salt<br />
1 package vanilla sugar (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)<br />
2 eggs<br />
150 g (2/3 cup) softened butter (or margarine)<br />
150 g (2/3 cup) sugar<br />
4 cl (3 tbsp) Amaretto (or 1 vial Amaretto essence)<br />
1 sliced banana<br />
60 g (2 oz.) chocolate flakes</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 180&deg;C (350&deg;F). Mix the flour, almonds, baking powder and vanilla sugar, and set aside. Beat the eggs, sugar and Ameretto until foamy, and slowly add butter. Mix in the flour mixture, then add the banana and chocolate flakes. Fill muffin forms 2/3 full and bake 20-25 minutes. Makes ca. 1 tray.</p>
