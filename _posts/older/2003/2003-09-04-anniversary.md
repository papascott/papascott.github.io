<p>In honor of the 20th anniversary of the <a href="/2001/09/06/">grounding</a> of the company and the <a href="/2002/09/07/">formation</a> of a more perfect union, the founding members of the firm will be on <a href="/2003/07/13/">retreat</a> for the following few days to reflect on the firm's past and its prospects for the future. The Marketing and Public Relations activities of the company will be on hiatus during this period, but the firm will be happy to serve you in the usual manner again on Monday. The firm thanks you for your patience. Have a nice day.</p>
