<p>On a day like today, nobody should care that I am home sick and miserable. Or that tomorrow I have to choose between the lesser of two evils, between going to work sick or staying home with Christopher and Oma (i.e. my mother-in-law).</p>
<p>I need to get well by Saturday, since Christopher and I are taking the ICE train to Berlin! Mama has a one day break between meetings, and she has invited us to her luxury hotel suite. </p>
<p>ZDF has just admitted that they have nothing new to report, but they continue to broadcast their special report anyway.</p>
