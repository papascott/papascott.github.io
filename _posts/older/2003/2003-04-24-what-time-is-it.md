<p>I'm still not in the swing of things. Mama had an early meeting this morning, so I was to take Christopher this morning, However,  I overslept by a full 2 hours, which of course wreacked total havoc on our tight weekday schedule.</p>
<p>At least, thanks to Easter Monday, it's a short 4-day work week. So is next week, thanks to May Day. One can get used to 4-day weeks rather quickly. I think I say that every year at Easter.</p>
