<p>I'm glad the <a title="Amiland" href="http://amiland.blogspot.com/2003_02_09_amiland_archive.html#88809910">Amiland</a> reads the German papers so I don't have to. He mentions a report from the <a title="USA stoppen Investitionen in ihre deutschen StÃ¼tzpunkte" href="http://www.wams.de/data/2003/02/09/40345.html">Welt am Sonntag</a> that the US Dept of Defense has halted investment at US bases in Germany, in particular planned construction at the air bases at Ramstein and Sprangdahlen. A hospital planned for Sprangdahlen will likely be built in Hungary.</p>
<p>Even if relations were currently good between Germany and the US, I wouldn't regard moving bases to the east a bad thing. The new NATO members are closer to potential action and can use the help more than the rich Germans. It might give a new purpose to NATO which currently seems directionless, which right now can't even decide how to come to the aid of Turkey in the event of war.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I live in the former British Occupation Zone, and therefore my local economy would not be affected one iota by an American pullout.</p>
