<p>Some blogs (<a title="BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis" href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_04.html#003598">BuzzMachine</a>, <a title="The Command Post - Iraq - German PM Schröder regrets words that hit U.S.-German ties" href="http://www.command-post.org/archives/005913.html">The Command Post</a>, <a title="USS Clueless - Schroeder apologizes" href="http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/04/Schroederapologizes.shtml">USS Clueless</a>) have cited a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/World/reuters20030419_155.html" title="Schroeder Regrets Words That Hit U.S.-German Ties">Reuters report</a> of a <a title="Kanzler: 'Dann lasst uns streiten!' - DER SPIEGEL - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,245358,00.html">Spiegel interview</a>. The Reuters article reports that the interview "is the furthest Schroeder has gone in trying to mend fences with the U.S.":</p>
<blockquote><p>"I deeply regret there were exaggerated comments -- also from cabinet members of my previous government," Schroeder told Der Spiegel magazine when asked if there were "grounds for self-criticism" for damage he caused to U.S.-German relations.<br />
The declaration was the furthest Schroeder has gone in trying to mend fences with the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>Except that Schröder's words were nothing new. He's been saying the same thing for weeks now. Note that he's not regretting anything that he said himself, only that there had been "exagertated comments"... also from the US, I presume. The German press is not reporting the interview as any change in foreign policy. Indeed, Spiegel has the interview filed under domestic news, as the main theme is Schröder's struggle with his own party over his economic reforms. The rest of the press isn't mentioning the article at all.</p>
<p>Maybe Reuters' man in Berlin should go out looking for real news instead of excerpting Spiegel articles.</p>
