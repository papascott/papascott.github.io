<p>One thng I've found while blogging is that it's impossible to know in advance what posts will get links. Some posts that I think are important and interesting don't get noticed at all, while some throwaway remark will generate lots of comments and links. </p>
<p>Or even start a new meme, like my <a href="/2003/07/qlinks.php#002426">joke link</a> to <a href="http://entenhausen.blogplan.de">entenhausen.blogplan.de</a> last week. After seeing the third or fourth city with a <a href="blogplan.de">blogplan</a>, I thought to myself 'next thing you know they'll put one up for Entenhausen' (the home of Donald Duck in German), and I put up a Quick Link. That same morning, the makers of blogplan <i>did</i> put up a map of Entenhausen, giving me <a href="http://wiesel.h-blog.org/archives/000169.html">credit</a> for the 'idea' (do I get royalties as well?), and it now has <s>nearly</s> over 60 blogs entered (PapaScott is on the dolphin).</p>
