<p>When I first <a title="PapaScott: Not-so-latent Antisemitism" href="https://www.papascott.de/2003/10/31/2674.php">posted</a> about the anti-semitic remarks by CDU Bundestag member Martin Hohmann, I thought it would be a back page story that would be forgotten the next day. I even tried to push the story to other blogs to make sure it would not go unnoticed. How wrong I was. Pressure has built on the CDU leadership to go beyond censuring Homann, especially after Defence Minister Struck <a title="BBC NEWS | Europe | German forces 'not anti-Semitic'" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3245039.stm">fired</a> the general in charge of Germany's special forces (KSK) for supporting Hohmann. </p>
<p>The CDU leadership has now buckled, and has  <a title="BBC NEWS | Europe | Party expels MP over Jewish row" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3259179.stm">started</a> the process of expelling Hohmann from the Bundestag faction and the party. Late, Frau Merkel, but not too late. You can take your ear off the ground now.</p>
