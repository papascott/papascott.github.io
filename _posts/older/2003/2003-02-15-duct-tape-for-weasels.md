<p>According to this <a title="BW Online | February 14, 2003 | Duct Tape: On a Roll" href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/feb2003/nf20030214_6029_db016.htm">Business Week article</a> (via <a title="Ministry of Propaganda - 15/February/2003: Duct Tape boom" href="http://www.ministryofpropaganda.co.uk/oldpropaganda/00000142.shtml">Ministry of Propaganda</a>), duct tape sales are up 200 to 300% since being recommended by Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge. And the market leader for duct tape in the US is a subsidiary of the German company Henkel. So is anybody calling for a boycott of German duct tape?</p>
