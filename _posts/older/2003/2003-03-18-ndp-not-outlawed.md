<p>Almost lost in the international news, the Federal Constitional Court in Karlsruhe <a title="ABCNEWS.com : Germany Throws Out Bid to Outlaw Party" href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/World/ap20030318_595.html">threw out the government's case</a> to outlaw the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party. After being <a href="/2002/01/23/115.php">stalled for over a year</a>, the case was tossed out on a rather significant technicality, namely that at least 30 of the party's 200 national and state leaders were paid police informants. It was thus impossible to for the court determine how much of the party's activities were instigated by informers for the government. </p>
<p>Interior Minister Schilly and the state ministries are pinning the blame on each other. In the end, the various ministries didn't know about the other's informants. Federalism doesn't work if you don't talk to one another. And the NDP lives on.</p>
