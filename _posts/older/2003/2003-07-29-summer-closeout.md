<p>I wouldn't have thought that the beginning of the summer close-out sales in German retail would be news to anyone other than the pensioners who line up   for bargains when the stores open, but <a title="Marstonalia: German gov't ditches rules on 'end of season sales'" href="http://marston.blogspot.com/2003_07_27_marston_archive.html#105942176186118863">Marstonalia</a> found it worthy of mention. Not that he was thinking of flying across the Atlantic for 60%, but because the Schr√∂der cabinet has proposed doing away with the regulation of such sales. While Marsonalia finds the regulation symbolic of a "German commitment to principles beyond commerce", most of the German press sees such regulation of retailers as blatant protection of small shops and retail unions and against the interest of consumers. Yesterday I chose to shop in a way that would please neither German retailers nor German unions. I bought a PDA on ebay, well after 8 pm and for much less than retail.</p>
