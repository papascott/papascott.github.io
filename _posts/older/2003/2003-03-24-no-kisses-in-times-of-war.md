<p>The pop duo t.A.T.u. performed on "Wetten Dass" on Saturday, and kissed rather passionately on stage. ZDF turned the cameras away... because of the war in Iraq! A network spokesman was quoted in the <a title="Es gibt doch zwei Rudi VÃ¶ller" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/03/24/137560.html">Abendblatt</a>. "It wasn't appropriate for a family show. And the mood of the broadcast was set by the war. We wanted everything to be somewhat 'softer'." </p>
<p>(Note the use of the 'New German' term 'softer' by the spokesman. As is usually the case with English words inserted directly into a German sentence, I have no idea what it's supposed to mean.)</p>
