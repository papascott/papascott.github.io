<p>As an experiment I've reactivated my <a title="truantville" href="http://tru.antville.org/">old antville weblog</a>  to do some posting in German. I imagine that my posts there will be a lot different than what I post here, since I won't have to write a paragraph of background information for a 4 word punch line.</p>
