<p>Our <em>Tagesmutter</em> is out of town for a conference, and MamaMaus is covorting on Malta, so I'm home alone with Christopher. Actually, I'm splitting the time so that today I have Christopher and his best friend Janik, while tomorrow they are both at Janik's house. Janik just started first grade, so we pick him up at school at 11:30 (yes, that's the wonderful German half-day school system). Wish me luck on surviving the afternoon! </p>
<p>Needless to say, attending the <a title="Meeting tonight by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com" href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/001664.shtml">Blogger Treff in Hamburg</a> this evening is out of the question.</p>
