<p><a title="BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis" href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_08.html#004426">"wir sprechen Amerikan"</a> is from a post about languages on the upcoming California ballot, but it is closer to the truth than you might think. In Germany, the language we speak in the US is often referred to as "Amerikanisch", as if it has nothing to do with English. Even better is to be referred to as a "US-Amerikaner", which even though it incorporates the beloved letters 'USA', to me sounds like PC mumbo-jumbo. I mean, even though there is North America and South America, there does not exist an 'America' of which the US is a subset. Please, just call me 'Ami'!</p>
