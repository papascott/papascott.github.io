<p>With his Grandma here for two and a half weeks, Christopher has now visited <a title="Willkommen beim Wildpark LÃ¼neburger Heide" href="http://www.wild-park.de/">3</a> <a title="Willkommen im Serengetipark!" href="http://www.serengeti-park.de/">animal</a> <a title="Tierpark Hagenbeck" href="http://www.hagenbeck.de/">parks</a> in the past 10 days &lt;insert obligatory photo of Christopher feeding elephants here&gt;. I think he is starting to suffer from animal park overload. He now has a dozen toy animals set up throughout the living room and kitchen for his jungle safari jeep tour, complete with special effects and very loud narration. And it is way past his bedtime.</p>
