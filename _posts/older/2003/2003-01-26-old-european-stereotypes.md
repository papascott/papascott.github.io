<p>In their reporting on the 40th anniversary of the <a title="Economist.com" href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1545760">Elys√©e treaty</a> (and before the Rumsfeld remarks on 'Old Europe'), our <a href="http://www.ndrinfo.de">local news radio station</a> interviewed people in Paris about their stereotype of Germans. The best answer they saved until the end.</p>
<p>"The typical German is just like the typical Frenchman. They always know better and never listen."</p>
