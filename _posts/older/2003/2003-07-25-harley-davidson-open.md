<p>Not only is this weekend supposed to have the longest traffic jams of the year (thanks to school vacation beginning in both Bavaria and Baden-WÃ¼rttemburg), but now 200,000 Harley fans have descended on Hamburg for the final stop of the <a title="Harley-Davidson | 100th Anniversary | Open Road Tour | Hamburg" href="http://www.harley-davidson.com/AN/100/ORT/HAMB/en/hamburg.asp">Harley-Davidson  100th Anniversary Open Road Tour</a>. And what do Harley fans do when they arrive in Hamburg? They cruise the Reeperbahn, what else? For those of us whose offices face the best known street in the city, on a <s>hot</s> very warm day when you have to keep the windows open, it was, well, hell on wheels. And the commute home was no picnic either.</p>
