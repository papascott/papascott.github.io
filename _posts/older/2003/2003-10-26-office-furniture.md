<p><a title="Design Sitzgruppe Leder schwarz + Glastisch !" href="http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2355639505"><img alt="ledersitze.jpg" src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/10/ledersitze.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" align="right" /></a>Mama is selling her office furniture... or at least the cold, sterile leather set that she inherited from her predecessor and is somewhat inpractical for holding meetings. So, on <a title="Design Sitzgruppe Leder schwarz + Glastisch !" href="http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=2355639505">ebay</a> it goes, couch, 4 chairs, and a glass table, all to the highest bidder. Wouldn't they look great in <em>your</em> office? The leather couch also makes a wonderful changing table, as we know from experience. And since the set must be picked up at her office in Hamburg, you'll have the chance to meet Mrs. PapaScott up close and personal. Bidding ends in 8 days, put in your bid today!</p>
