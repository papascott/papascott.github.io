<p>We were busy all day yesterday hosting our annual German Fourth-of-July grill party. Lately, however, it has not been all that annual. In fact, our last one was in 1998 (it was cold and rainy, and Germany lost to Croatia in the World Cup)Then came pregnancy and baby, and then we were just out of the habit.</p>
<p>This year was also cold and rainy, but were able to stay under the carport in relative comfort. We had twice as much food and drink as we needed, except the California red wine. And we ended up at 1am with a heated 3-way discussion of the German reaction to the Iraq war and conspiracy theories on MÃ¶llemann's death (I was listening, not discussing, on both counts). So I guess it was a successful party.</p>
