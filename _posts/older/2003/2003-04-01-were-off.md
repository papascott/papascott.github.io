<p>Well, actually, we're leaving tomorrow for Floida, but the computers at home are getting turned off now. Maybe I'll post from Florida, maybe I'll even post from the flight over (we're taking the Lufthansa route where inflight WiFi is being tested), or maybe I won't post at all until Easter when we return.</p>
