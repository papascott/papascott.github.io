<p>Yech. The ice and snow had been gone for 3 weeks, until today. The snow returned, with wind and temperatures near freezing, just in time for evening rush hour. My 60 minute commute from work to day care and home took nearly 3 hours.</p>
<p>Christopher's grandparents will be disappointed to hear that the OshKosh overalls they gave him for Christmas already have a hole worn in the knee. They are the only pants he ever wants to wear, so I guess we will have to find a way to patch them from the inside. He doesn't like patches on the outside.</p>
