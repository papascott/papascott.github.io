<p>Some of the students quoted in the Spiegel Online article (also on p 46 of this week's print edition) on <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,240473,00.html">exchange students in the US</a> that I <a href="/2003/03/17/2125.php">posted on earlier</a> have <a title="TASTE - Presse-Infos" href="http://www.tastenet.de/spiegel.html">responded</a>. Their comments were taken out of context, and they are in fact having a great time during their school year in the States. And Der Spiegel is apparently suffering from an extreme bout of anti-Americanism. Thanks to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0113064/">The Cartoonist</a> for pointing out the link!</p>
