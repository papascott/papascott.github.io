<ul style="list-style-type: disc;list-style-position: inside;">
<li>Others may blog about not wanting to blog... I just do it, with the exception of some Christopher pictures and a few quick links. Father, forgive me, it has been over two weeks since my last real post.</li>
<li>Maybe it's because I'm irritable, due to carbohydrate withdrawl. Losing weight is easy, I've done it dozens of times. This time I really mean it. Really, I do.
</li>
<li>I probably won't make the Blogger-Treff in Hamburg next week, since Mama is in Malta all week, and we have no day care Thursday and Friday.</li>
<li>I want the new G4 iBook.</li>
</ul>
