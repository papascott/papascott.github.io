<p>I haven't mentioned the tragic end of the space shuttle Columbia, since so many others have and I don't have much to add about how I feel, other than what I already wrote about <a href="https://www.papascott.de/2003/01/28/2083.php">the Challenger anniversary</a>. Christopher is of course too young to understand, and he gets excited when the news shows yet another tape of a shuttle launch, since it shows both a <span xml:lang="de" title="airplane" style="border-bottom: dotted 1px; font-style: italic;">Flugzeug</span> <u>and</u> a <span xml:lang="de" title="rocket" style="border-bottom: dotted 1px; font-style: italic;">Rakete</span>. I'm just happy that there are no pictures of wreckage that he can recognize, then I don't have to explain <span xml:lang="de" title="airplane broken" style="border-bottom: dotted 1px; font-style: italic;">Flugzeug kaputt</span>, and that there is no way to make it <span xml:lang="de" title="all better" style="border-bottom: dotted 1px; font-style: italic;">wieder heil</span>.</p>
