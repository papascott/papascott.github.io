<p>The ghost of Schill continues to haunt the coalition in Hamburg. He was quiet for a while after having been <a title="PapaScott: No Mercy" href="https://www.papascott.de/2003/08/19/2519.php">tossed</a> <a title="PapaScott: Schill Out" href="https://www.papascott.de/2003/08/21/2522.php">out</a> of the Senate by Mayor von Beust. Last weekend he was re-elected as the state party chair. </p>
<p>In the past week, however, he has returned to his old self, attacking von Beust, his successor Interior Minister Nockelmann. A new role in this coalition is unthinkable, given that von Beust has sworn to never again sit at the same table as Schill.</p>
<p>For his party, one week of the new-old Schill was enough. The  national party board has <a title="Schill-Rauswurf: In Hamburg wackelt die Koalition - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,277266,00.html">dismissed Schill as state chair</a>. It's now <a title="Noch'n Blogg.: Schill als Hamburger Landesvorsitzender abgesetzt" href="http://lumma.de/mt/archives/000751.html#000751">very possible</a> that Schill will form his own faction in the Hamurg BÃ¼rgerschaft, take a couple of supporters with him, and force new elections. Stay tuned.</p>
