<p>We accidentally tuned in to the <a title="RTL.de" href="http://www.rtl.de/musik/musik_819362.html">DDR Show</a> (with a mostly silent Kati Witt and, um, some blond guy) last night (ZDF was running soccer, so Heute Journal was running late). Now I can answer the question of whether 'Ostalgie' shows trivialize the brutal dictatorship of the DDR with an unqualified 'yes'.</p>
<p>They did have ex-FM Genscher together with a couple who were among the several thousand who had camped out at the West German embassy in Prague back in 1989 and were allowed to emigrate. The couple thanked Genscher for his actions back then. Shouldn't it have been the other way around?</p>
