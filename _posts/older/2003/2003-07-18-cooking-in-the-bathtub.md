<p>A warning for young parents: in the hands of a three-year-old, an ordinary kitchen ladle can become a deadly weapon. Christopher has been on a cooking kick lately. He likes to stir the spaghetti sauce while it is simmering, and to ladle out the portions (under strict and watchful supervision, of course). So now the ladle is his personal property, and this evening he plucked it out of the dishwasher and took it with him upstairs. Within minutes, the bathroom floor was covered with a a dangerous film of soapy water, and the planned bath was cancelled for safety reasons.</p>
<p>He's now playing in this room with <a href="/2002/10/27/1956.php">papa</a> and baby snake. How sweet.</p>
