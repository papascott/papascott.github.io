<p>Keep in mind that the three big news stories of this weekend were the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the rejection by the Turkish parliament of the deal to allow the US to attack Iraq from Turkey, and the destruction of the first Samoud missiles by Iraq. Here then were the top headlines in this morning's local paper <a title="Hamburger Abendblatt Online" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/">Hamburger Abendblatt</a>:</p>
<p>* Poll disaster for SPD in the North (local elections in Schleswig-Holstein)</p>
<p>* Fall of an Idol (footballer Oliver Kahn admits having affair while wife is pregnant)</p>
<p>* Ja Ja Juliette (semi-finals of 'Deutschland sucht den Superstar', a form of 'American Idol')</p>
<p>For comic relief, a report on private detectives seeking out workers who fake sick was also mentioned on the front page... on Rosenmontag, the highlight of Karneval (which is not celebrated in Hamburg).</p>
