<p>Everyone and their mother has already linked to it, so it's no use to mention the announcement for <a title="Six Log: Six Apart Milestones" href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/04/six_apart_miles.shtml">TypePad</a> by the makers of Movable Type. But it will be cool to see how Movable Type can scale to a full-blown web hosting service, and whether Ben and Mena can make money doing it.</p>
