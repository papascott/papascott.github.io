<p>Mama's PC is getting a long-needed software update, a nice fresh Windows 2000 Pro. Yes, anyone named <acronym title="she who must not be named">Voldemort</acronym> must be using Windows 2000. We finished the chicken-and-egg driver phase (i.e. you need a network driver to connect to the Internet, but to get the driver you need to be on the Internet) and the 30MB-of-security-updates phase. We still need to find the printer and audio drivers, install her aps, and make the desktop pretty.</p>
<p>I'd love to give her Linux, but her job as Voldemort requires that she work with tools of the devil like Word documents and Excel sheets. And she doesn't feel like learning a 2nd OS, and I don't blame her.</p>
