<p>Yet another <a title="Europe pines for big-spending US tourists | csmonitor.com" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0818/p07s01-woeu.html">'where have all the US tourists gone'</a> article noted by <a title="Instapundit.com:" href="http://www.instapundit.com/archives/011030.php">Instapundit</a>.  Funny how these articles never mention Germany. I've seen statistics that the number of US visitors is down, but haven't read anyone complaining. The German tourist industry industry seems more concerned with keeping German tourists at home. </p>
<p>Even though Hamburg is a big tourist town, I've never noticed very many Americans among the foreign accents. Maybe it's because the main attractions are theater and sex (er, I mean, night life), both in the German language.</p>
