<p>A number of folks (well, ok, two) at BlogTalk referred to me as a German blogging pioneer. It made me feel old, but it did earn me a number (two) of beers. My blog cred may not go back as far as that of Rebecca Blood (April 1999), who gave a keynote in Vienna, but I did try out Blogger for a few weeks later that summer. And, surprise, surprise, the <a title="Maus Newsletter" href="https://www.papascott.de/blogger99.html">Maus Newsletter</a> is still in the Blogger database. Just for fun, I decided to publish it (slightly edited for spousal privacy). </p>
<p>This is not actually the <a title="PapaScott: Old Times" href="https://www.papascott.de/2001/09/10/1538.php">first time</a> I've rediscovered my old Blogger page, though. I guess I have the right to dig it up evey 2 years.</p>
