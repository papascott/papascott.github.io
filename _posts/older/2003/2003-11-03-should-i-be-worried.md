<p>My wife will be attending a costume party on a <a title="Everything about the Maltese Islands - Malta, Gozo and Comino" href="http://www.visitmalta.com/">Mediterranean island</a> this week, put on by her employer. <a title="Calpundit: Absolutely, Your Honor, It Was a Legitimate Business Expense" href="http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002551.html">Should I be worried?</a></p>
<p>At least her party has a pirate theme instead of <a title="MSNBC: It?s My Party ..." href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/987944.asp?0cv=KB10&cp1=1">ancient Rome</a>.</p>
