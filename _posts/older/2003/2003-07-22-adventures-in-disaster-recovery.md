<p>Today I found out what happens on a virtual server when the disk space is full and a piece of spam mail arrives.</p>
<ol>
<li>The spam gets filtered to the spam folder</li>
<li>The mail cannot be saved, so return to sender</li>
<li>The sender is the spam filter, namely me. Send an error message via mail</li>
<li>The mail cannot be saved, so return to sender</li>
<li>Repeat <i>ad infinitum</i></li>
</ol>
<p>At which point I opted to resize my diskspace. 45 minutes later, we were back online.</p>
