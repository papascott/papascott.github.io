<p>Christopher has apparently decided he doesn't like staying up late anymore, and has unilaterally changed his sleep schedule. His routine has now shifted by 90 minutes, so instead of going to sleep at 9 and waking up at 7, he now goes to sleep at 7:30 and wakes up at 5:30. It's like he's now 2 time zones ahead of us, and as you can imagine this has thoroughly confused our morning routine. We've been getting up at 5:30 anyway, so it's not like we're having to get up earlier. It's just that we were used to peace and quiet in the morning. No longer.</p>
