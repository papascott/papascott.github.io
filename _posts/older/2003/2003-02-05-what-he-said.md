<p>I'm feeling a bit under the weather, so I'll just point again to <a title="" href="http://chicagoboyz.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_chicagoboyz_archive.html#88551052">Ralf Goergens</a> (who must be <em>very</em> happy about the SPD's recent defeat, since he's been writing a lot lately :-). He explains why that despite Franco-German unilaterialism and the Aznar letter, the EU isn't going to be weakened by the Iraq issue. Because subsidizing cows is too important to be left to politics.</p>
<p>He's also right that the US tends to take the EU much too seriously. Let me try to explain... the EU is just like NAFTA, except with a parliament. And a flag. And a hymn. A very <a href="http://www.italcultusa.org/DCeuhymn.html">good</a> hymn, I might add, and composed without any EU subsidy at all.</p>
