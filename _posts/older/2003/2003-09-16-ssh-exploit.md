<p>I hate <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/09/16/1327248.shtml?tid=126&amp;tid=172">patching SSH</a>. Especially when the exploit is announced just as I am leaving work. So do I try to apply the patch from home, or do I wait until morning?</p>
<p>I selected apply from home, and of course the ssh daemon killed my connection and wouldn't let me back in. Nuts.</p>
