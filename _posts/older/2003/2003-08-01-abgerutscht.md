<p>This week I got the Springsteen <a title="Amazon.de: Detailseite Musik: The Rising (Special Tour Edition CD   DVD) [DOPPEL-CD]" href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008XUUH/qid=1059761945/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_10_1/302-8532796-2015238">Special Tour Edition DVD</a>, with 5 songs from The Rising. Christopher really likes it, especially when Bruce slides across the stage ('Das m√ºssen wir Mama zeigen!'). I'm glad it includes Dancing In The Dark, since we missed the finale of his concert in Hamburg (we had to hit the road to pick up Christopher from the babysitter before midnight).</p>
