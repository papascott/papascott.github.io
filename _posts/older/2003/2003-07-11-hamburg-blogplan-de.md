<p><a href="http://hamburg.blogplan.de/"><img alt="blogplan.jpg" src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/07/blogplan.jpg" width="175" height="147" border="0" align="right" /></a>Thanks to <a href="http://lumma.de">Nico's</a> intern <a href="http://wiesel.h-blog.org/">Sven</a>, we bloggers in Hamburg now have a <a href="http://hamburg.blogplan.de/">blogplan</a>, where we can track each other by the nearest U/S-Bahn station. Over 50 blogs have been entered.</p>
<p>I actually live quite a ways south of Hittfeld, but Buchholz isn't in the Hamburg transit system (yet). I work at station St. Pauli, my wife's office is near Mundsburg, and our first apartment in Hamburg was exactly halfway between Barmbek and Alter Teichweg.</p>
