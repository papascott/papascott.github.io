<p>I hate CSS. And I don't care about RSS. </p>
<p>I'd just like to have an RSS feed that everyone is happy with. (And I'd like to include extra information for my own use, so I can, say, have an RSS file for each entry and archive I publish, and use those files instead of Movable Type templates to generate each web page. But that's futuretalk.)</p>
<p>But after my feed was <a title="Don Park's Blog" href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/06/23.html#a615">shamed by Don Park</a> as an example of funky RSS (and he used another f-word several times to express how he feels about funky RSS in general), I decided to defunkify my feed (starting with the <a href="http://www.mediagap.org/mt/mt-rss.txt">template</a> by Alexander Barnes Dryer <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/23#When:8:13:39AM">mentioned by Dave Winer</a>). The result of my effort for now is <a href="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/index_xml_250603.txt">this template</a>.</p>
<p>Now my head is spinning, a dangerous condition this early in the morning, and I can confirm that thinking about RSS causes severe brain damage. And my feed is only <em>mostly</em> defunkified, because I still have a content:encoded element because, well, I like having all the markup. So I still don't pass the <a href="http://www.thereisnocat.com/funkidator/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.papascott.de%2Findex.xml&mode=funkidate&funkidate=Funkidate Me%21">Funkidator</a>. </p>
<p>This still won't make everyone happy. That's why I think <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RoadMap">Sam Ruby's initiative to create a new common format</a> is a good thing, not because I care about RSS (I don't), but because it will help prevent brain damage.</p>
<p><b>Update</b> Brad Choate has a <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/001639.php">template</a> he hopes will pass the 'Dave' test.</p>
