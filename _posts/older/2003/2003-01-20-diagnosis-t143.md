<p>Mama went to the doctor today. The ligament in her ankle is not completely torn, so surgery will not be necessary, but the ankle was still too swollen to apply the gel cast today. She'll get that on Wednesday. Meanwhile she is taking Arthotec for the pain and swelling as well as a set of injections against thrombosis. She can slide up and down the stairs, so she's sleeping upstairs again. She go back to work next week, but probably won't be able to drive for another week after that.</p>
