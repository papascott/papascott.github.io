<p>Last week at <a href="http://windsofchange.net/">Winds of Change</a> I saw the <a title="Winds of Change.NET: Guest Blog: Stories from Germany (scroll to chaplain's story)" href="http://windsofchange.net/archives/003361.html">story</a> of German Bundeswehr soldiers saluting injured American soldiers arriving from Iraq, as reported by an American chaplain. Today, I saw the same story (translated into German) on <a title="Abendblatt.de: Wiedersehen in Ramstein" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/04/28/153344.html"> page 4 of our local paper</a>. The Abendblatt reported that it had been forwarded by email to a reader in Hamburg. It's nice to see the story in a German paper, but blogs were faster!</p>
