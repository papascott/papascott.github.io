<p>Nothing was found, and the information may not have been as concrete as officials in Hamburg had implied. <a title="tagesschau.de : Kein Sprengstoff in Hamburg gefunden" href="http://tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID2806070_NAV_REF1,00.html">Federal Interior Minister Schily</a> said last night that he regrets that the police action in Hamburg prematurely made the warnings public. Hamburg officials may be nervous as a result of the ongoing political turmoil in the city; the parliament dissolved itself yesterday to clear the way for early elections in February.</p>
