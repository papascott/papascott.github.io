<p>After reading at <a title="generation neXt ____ Weblog -- Story: DVDs leihen" href="http://www.x-ploration.de/weblog_1384.php">generation neXt</a> that  <a href="http://www.amango.de/">Amango</a> (a German DVD-rental-by-mail service a l√° <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>) has an entry level offer for 9,90 Euro per month (for 1 DVD at a time), I decided to check them out. They're located in Hamburg, so we should get quick turnover. I'm spoiled by the German post, though... I was disappointed that the first DVD arrived after two days instead of overnight. But if the service is decent, I'm sure we'll upgrade to the standard package (3 DVDs at a time for 19,90 Euros).</p>
<p>The other German Netflix clone <a href="http://www.netleih.de/">Netleih</a> also has a 9,90 Euro deal (4 DVDs per month, 2 at a time).</p>
