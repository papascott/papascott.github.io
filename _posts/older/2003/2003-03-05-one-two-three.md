<p>Call me gruesome, but when I heard yesterday that <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/04/obit.buchholz.ap/">the actor Horst Buchholz had died</a>, my first thought was the hope that the frantic Billy Wilder comedy <a title="One, Two, Three (1961)" href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0055256">One, Two, Three (1961)</a>, starring Buchholz and James Cagney, would be televised. Sure enough, it's showing right now on BR. </p>
<p>OK, the film mostly stars Cagney, as a hyperactive Coca-Cola executive in post-war pre-Wall Berlin. For example, he's trying to close a deal with the Russians. They offer him a Cuban cigar.</p>
<p>"We made a deal with Castro. He sends us cigars, we send him missiles."</p>
<p>"You're being cheated! This cigar is badl!"</p>
<p>"So are the missiles."</p>
<p>You'll have to see the movie yourself to know how Cagney "learns umlauts" with his German secretary. Sitzen machen!</p>
