<p>After continuously reading the past months in warblogs how Europe no longer matters, I am <a title="Innocents Abroad" href="http://innocentsabroad.blogspot.com/2003_01_26_innocentsabroad_archive.html#90249402">amused</a> to now <a title="Cato the Youngest: January 26, 2003 - February 01, 2003 Archives" href="http://www.catotheyoungest.com/archives/week_2003_01_26.html#000633">see</a>  various blogs taking country counts of European countries 'for' (10) and 'against' (5) us. Diplomatic efforts are now furiously underway in Lichtenstein, San Marino, the Vatican, Andorra, and the Grand Duchy of Fenwick to further stack the counts. Maybe we can take call-in votes from the TV audience like at the Eurovision Song Contest. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, is anyone taking count of countries in the Americas? Maybe the Iraq question can be put to the Organization of American States for majority vote. Or to the panel of the latest TV reality series.</p>
