<p>The controversial exhibition Körperwelten (Body Worlds) by Prof. Gunther von Hagen is opening in <a title="BODYWORLDS-Current exhibition Hamburg" href="http://www.koerperwelten.de/en/pages/ausstellung_hamburg.asp">Hamburg</a> this week, and showing through 4 January. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the exhibition is at the former Erotic Art Museum on the Reeperbahn, Hamburg's red-light and entertainment main street. I'm personally looking forward to the chance to see the plastinated human bodies for myself, and it will be something special to show to my mother when she comes to visit her grandson next month. I personally believe that while the human spirit is holy and should be revered, the human body is not.</p>
