<p>As is befitting my mood on the pending war in Iraq, I've starting reading <a title="Der Brand. Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940-1945" href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3549071655"><em>Der Brand</em></a> (The Fire), the account by historian JÃ¶rg Friedrich of the Allied bombing of German cities in World War II (<a title="Germans Revisit War's Agony, Ending a Taboo" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/15/international/europe/15DRES.html">mentioned</a> this past weekend in the NY Times). The book has been controversial outside Gemany for supposedly <a title="A cure for amnesia" href="http://www.theage.com.au/handheld/articles/2003/03/15/1047583738545.htm">implying</a> that the bombing of German cities was a war crime. I'm going to try to judge for myself. It's heavy, slow reading. I hope I make it to the end.</p>
