<p>Last Easter, just after we returned from our Florida trip, I over 106 kg. I started an Atkins diet, and in 4 weeks I was down to 99 kg. But after 6 weeks I started getting bored with it, and got off  the wagon in early June. </p>
<p>Then 3-1/2 weeks ago I stepped on the scale and I was back up to 101.6 kg. I decided to start  Atkins again. This morning I was at 96.9 kg, so altogether in 2 stretches I've lost nearly 10 kg, or over 20 lbs.</p>
<p>I'm documenting this success for myself, in case I should get bored with it again. I'd like to get down to 85 kg if I can.</p>
