<p>Today is Labor Day in the States, and it is thus somehow appropriate to report on  Germany's second largest and most troubled union <a title="IG Metall: Homepage mit Nachrichten" href="http://www.igmetall.de/">IG Metall</a>, which elected a new chairman in an extraordinary session yesterday. That the traditionalist Jürgen Peters would be elected had already been decided in a smoke-filled room. That he would receive the vote of only 66% of the delegates was a surprise.</p>
<p><a title="almost a diary: Smug for a day." href="http://tschwarz.freepage4you.de/aad/archives/000931.php">Tobias</a> and <a title="Cum Grano Salis" href="http://cumgranosalis.blogspot.com/2003_08_31_cumgranosalis_archive.html#106235580407051312">Hans</a>  (trust me on the links, I can't get either to work at the moment) have already commented on the (ir)relevance of unions in  modern German politics. I can only point to the <a title="heute.t-online.de - IG Metall leidet unter Mitgliederschwund" href="http://www.heute.t-online.de/ZDFheute/artikel/26/0,1367,WIRT-0-2040026,00.html">ZDF archive article</a> from April 2003 on declining membership in the IG Metall. Of their 2.64 million members, 8% are youth (students and apprentices?), 24% are pensioners, and 300,000 (6%) are unemployed. That means of that 2.64 million, 38%, or over 1 million, <em>do not work</em>.  (I'm not even counting full-time union and workers' council functionaries...)</p>
<p>Only 290,000 members are in the eastern states, so it is no surprise that the strike in the east for the 35-hour work week failed so miserably.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that when the unions came out against Schröder's reforms, the Chancellor simply laughed in their collective faces?</p>
<p>Disclaimer: IG Metall also represents workers in the computer software industry. They would be 'my' union if I were inclined to join, and they helped organize the worker's council at my employer.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> <a title="Lilli Marleen" href="http://www.lillimarleen.blogspot.com/2003_09_01_lillimarleen_archive.html#106245045868991069">Lilli</a>, an active SPD member, is also somewhat doubtful about Peters.</p>
