<p>Sloppy editing at <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/english">Deutsche Welle</a> is turning a domestic <a title="ABC News: Germany Says Smallpox Report Exaggerated" href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/World/ap20030216_1608.html">budget and turf dispute</a> into an <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/feb0303.html#021803121pm">international</a> <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2003_02_16_dish_archive.html#90339870">incident</a>. The oppostion is asking the health minister why she is stockpiling smallpox vaccine (and outdated vaccine at that) when the interior minister says there is no threat of a smallpox terrorist attack . DW-World <a title="DW-World: Ministers Play Down Threat of Smallpox Attack" href="http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1430_A_781802_1_A,00.html">reported</a></p>
<blockquote><p>In the interviews, two German government ministers let readers know that there is little danger now that that [sic] American-hating terrorists could unleash the smallpox virus on the German population.</p></blockquote>
<p>This could imply that a goal of Germany's anti-war policy is to appease terrorists. As <a title="Amiland" href="http://amiland.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_amiland_archive.html#89333861">Amiland</a> points out, there is nothing in the original interviews that even remotely suggests this. No, this is just domestic politics as usual, nothing to see here.</p>
<p>Then again, as <a title="NY Times Op-Ed: Behind the Great Divide" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/18/opinion/18KRUG.html">Paul Krugman</a> says (as cited by <a href="http://tschwarz.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_tschwarz_archive.html#%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2089343424">Tobias Schwarz</a>), maybe the media in Europe and the US are reporting from such completely different perspectives as to make any understanding totally impossible.</p>
