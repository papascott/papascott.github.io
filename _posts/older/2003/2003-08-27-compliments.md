<p>Mama's coming back tonight from a 3-day business meeting in Munich. Father and son will be both happy to see her. I, for one, will trying apply what Lyssa said about <a title="Lyssas Lounge - Die Kunst des Kompliments" href="http://lyssaslounge.diaryland.com/030823_15.html">women and compliments</a>. After so many years of marriage, however, it's hard to come up with new ones, and the easy thing to do is to take things for granted and just not bother. And I've certainly been guilty of that. So, Mama, you are <a title="Read Lyssa for explanation" href="http://lyssaslounge.diaryland.com/030823_15.html">rock and roll</a>. </p>
<p>Except that in a personal relationship, I don't suppose that compliments given via a public weblog really count.</p>
