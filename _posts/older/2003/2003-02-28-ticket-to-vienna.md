<p>I don't really have a proposal ready for my <a title="BlogTalk - A European Weblog-Conference" href="http://blogtalk.net/">BlogTalk</a> paper on <a href="https://www.papascott.de/2003/02/11/2098.php">warblogs for Euro-weenies</a>, but since today is the deadline for proposals I threw together what I had and sent it in. I was heartened to see that <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/">JÃ¶rg Kantel</a> submitted <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2003/02/28.html#00577">"a bunch of unconnected notes"</a>, which I bet I can match in unconnectedness. (Then again he's a keynote speaker, and I was just invited to make a proposal.) I did manage to quote a line from <a title="Lost in time, and lost in space, and meaning" href="http://www.rockyhorror.com/">Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>, and I'm not sure if I should do the whole thing in a Rocky Horror theme, or just include random film quotes (the scorpion line from Lawrence of Arabia <a title="Thy mother mated with a scorpion!" href="http://vowe.net/archives/003043.html">mentioned today</a> on vowe.net would be fitting as well). But I guess the proposal has to be accepted first.</p>
