<p>Rather late at our grillfest last weekend, my wife and I impulsively decided to head someplace warm and romantic for our 20th anniversary in September, since our day care provider (under the influence of the California red wine, I'm sure) offered to look after Christopher for that weekend. This would be a second honeymoon, except that we never really had a first honeymoon. Our first thought was Rome, and checking the prices and the flight schedules it looks very good. Now, I've never been to Italy at all, and Mama only once to Verona, so I'll ask my readers. What's essential to see and do (and eat and drink) in Rome for if one is there for 48 hours? No rental car, and no hangovers, please.</p>
