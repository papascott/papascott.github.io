<p>It's going to be warm again today, so we're heading for the <a href="http://www.travemuende.de">beach</a> (early, so we beat the traffic). </p>
<p>Christopher is still asking to see the Springsteen video to watch Bruce slide. Is he too young to be watching music videos? Not if it's <em>good</em> music.</p>
<p>I, too, was a <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> <a href="http://papascott.typepad.com/">beta tester</a>. I didn't look at it that closely, since I'm not looking to replace my present hoster (namely, me). But I did make a couple suggestions in regards to color-blind users. They're opening up to the general public tomorrow, and if anyone wants a 20% discount for 'friends of beta-testers', let me know and say you're my friend. I'm allowed to have 20 friends.</p>
