<p>Christopher's Grandma has been here since Friday, and the two are inseparable. He even insists on sleeping in her bed. She doesn't seem to mind  As for language, Christopher understands Grandma's English perfectly, but Grandma has some trouble with Christopher's German, but he manages to make himself understood.</p>
<p>No pictures for now. Our <a href="https://www.papascott.de/1999/12/07/1167.php">nearly 4-year-old Nikon Coolpix</a> suffered (yet another) 1 meter fall to the floor a couple of weeks ago. It's not designed for the kind of stress, and it's not worth the price of repair. A <a title="Canon PowerShot A70" href="http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/a70-60/index.html">replacement</a> is on its way.</p>
