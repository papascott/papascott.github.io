<p>On the autobahn this morning, a plastic pallet fell from a truck onto the road. Hardly a notable event, except that it occurred directly in front of me. I was unable to avoid the obstacle, and thus drove over it. My right front tire did not survive the encounter, and neither did the wheel. Just to make things interesting, my spare was flat as well. </p>
<p>All's well that ends well. The auto club pumped up the spare, I limped into my local <a href="http://www.atu.de">ATU</a>, left them my car and took the bus to work. I now have 4 spanking new tires. And dirty fingernails. And am short 2 hours on my time sheet at work.</p>
