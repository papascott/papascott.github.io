<p>Ten days after her injury, Mama is now able to hobble across the room without crutches. She's able to handle Christopher in the morning, so I've gone back to my normal work schedule. She's back at work, staying in the office. We imagine that next week she'll be able to drive again. </p>
<p>All in all she's been a very good patient. I've only had to remind her a couple of times to take it easy. She's gotten good treatment from her next-door neighbor (a physical therapist) and her sister-in-law (a <em>Heilpraktikerin</em>, or nonmedical practitioner). She's only seen her doctor once.</p>
