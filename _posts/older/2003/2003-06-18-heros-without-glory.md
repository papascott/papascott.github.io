<p><img title="Nieder mit der Regierung - Down with the Government" alt="Documentary photo of girl holding sign in Leipzig, 17 June 1953" src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/heldenohneruhm.jpg" width="300" height="218" border="0" /></p>
<p><a href="http://heldenohneruhm.de/">Helden ohne Ruhm</a> is a fascinating documentary of the 1953 uprising shown in ARD last night. It features interviews with demonstrators, VoPos, Soviet soldiers, and widows. It's being rerun tonight (RBB) and tomorrow (SWR) if you missed it. The photo is from newly discovered footage from Leipzig. The girl holding the sign was imprisoned until 1962.</p>
