<p>A poster advertising <a href="http://www.axe.de/">'anti-hangover' shower gel</a> is gracing the city this week. That alone is weird enough to warrant a post, but even stranger is the tagline (with apologies to <a title="Code The Web Socket" href="http://ahawkins.org/weblog.php">Alwin</a>): Need help in the morning? The nurse waits in your shower! </p>
