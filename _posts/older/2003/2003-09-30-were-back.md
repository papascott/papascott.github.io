<p>We're back from Cologne. Christopher loved Phantasialand. We told him that we would be staying at the Dragon City (which he knows from Jim Knopf), since the hotel had a Chinese theme, and he was able to find plenty of dragons. At the park itself, he had to ride the monorail 4 times to see the (machanized) mammoth and dinosaurs.</p>
<p>On the way back, we stopped at the cathedral in Cologne just to see some architecture that's not part of a theme park. And we did not stop at the chocolate museum. Maybe next time.</p>
