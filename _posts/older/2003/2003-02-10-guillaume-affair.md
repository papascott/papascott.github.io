<p>Is there a mole in the Chancellor's office? Only an enemy agent could propose releasing to the press a supposed Franco-German plan to send UN peacekeepers to Iraq while the US Defense Secretary is in Germany, without informing the Americans, or the French, or anyone else in NATO, or the Defense Ministry, or the Foreign Ministry, or even Joschka Fischer, or anyone other than the Chancellor himself. And two days later, everyone denies that such a plan ever exisited.</p>
<p>But Germany no longer has any enemies. Who would hate Germany, who would hate Gerhard Schr√∂der so much as to launch such an evil plan. The only one that could hate the Chancellor that much would be.... could be... must be... Oskar Lafontaine!</p>
<p>Unless it were... Rudolf Scharping?</p>
