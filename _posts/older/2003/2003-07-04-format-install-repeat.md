<p>I don't do anything serious in Windows, I just use it to play around. So I am rather proud that, without even trying, I managed to screw up my XP installation to the point that it no longer is able to boot (some kernel file is missing or damaged). I think I rebooted while the windows updater was running, or did something else equally as stupid. There's nothing there I really want to keep, so I'll just wipe it out and start again. I should really stick to stable operating systems, though.</p>
