<p>Interestingly, yesterday I noticed two completely unrelated posts mentioning "The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum" at <a title="Marstonalia" href="http://marston.blogspot.com/2003_06_01_marston_archive.html#200396629">Marstonalia</a> and <a title="steffanie.net | logblogwhatever...: Katarina Blums förlorade heder" href="http://www.steffanie.net/blog/arkiv/000659.html">logblogwhatever</a>. Brett's post was on how the film has lessons for the US today on dealing with terrorism, Steffanie's post was in Swedish, but I suspect she's reading the book by Heinrich Böll in the original German.</p>
