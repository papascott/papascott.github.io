<p>We had a nice evening last night at our first ever <a title="Heiko Hebig | hebig.com | BlogMeet Hamburg, blogging live" href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/001098.html">BlogMeet Hamburg</a>. Nine of us us altogether, and except for Heiko, I didn't 'know' anyone until last night. The group was quite diverse, including two people from the local blogging start-up <a href="http://www.20six.de/">20six</a> and a couple of diarists from <a href="http://www.diaryland.com/">Diaryland</a>, who find it amazing that some of us blog under our real names. Of course I didn't note names or URLs, although Heiko took pictures. I'm already looking forward to next time, someplace quieter where it's easier to talk. (By the way, I never paid for my drinks. Do I owe anyone?)</p>
