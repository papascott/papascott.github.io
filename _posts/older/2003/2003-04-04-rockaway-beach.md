<p>"It's not hard, not far to reach<br />
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach"</p>
<p>Actually, we are at Indian Rocks Beach, just south of Clearwater, Florida. Luckily they don't "blast out the disco on the radio" like in the Ramones song. Sunny, quiet, and connected, thanks to a $10 one-month account at <a href="http://www.budgetdÃ­alup.com">Budget Dialup</a>, which is working more reliably than the big-time provider Mama uses to dial into her employer's VPN.</p>
<p>I was going to get a pre-paid card for my spare cellphone (Motorola Timeport, cost &euro;13 used)  for the two weeks, but US cellular service is so expensive and confusing, I think I'll just pay the roaming charges for my German provider for the few times I'm going to call. </p>
<p>By the way, the WiFi on the Lufthansa flight was out of service, although they offered plain-old-ethernet. Mama used up her battery reading her mail at work, and they only offered electrical sockets in business and first class. Sitting in economy with a three-year-old is not a optimal environment for using a notebook anyway. Despite the fears of World Wide Klein, Lufthansa did not lose any of our luggage, but we only had two suitcases.</p>
