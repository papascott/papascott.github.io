<p>Arlo Guthrie: "We got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump.  So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the city dump.</p>
<p>"Well we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the dump saying, 'Closed on Thanksgiving.'  And we had never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.</p>
<p>"We didn't find one. Until we came to a side road, and off the side of the side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the cliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile is better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw our's down.</p>
<p>"That's what we did, and drove back to the church, had a thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep and didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone call from officer Obie.  He said, 'Kid, we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it.' And I said, 'Yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope under that garbage.'...</p>
<p>"'Kid, whad'ya get?'  I said, 'I didn't get nothing, I had to pay $50 and pick up the garbage.'" <a title="LYRICS - Alice's Restaurant" href="http://www.arlo.net/lyrics/alices.shtml">continued</a></p>
