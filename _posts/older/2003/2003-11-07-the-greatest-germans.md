<p>The evening news on ZDF was pre-empted for 'Unsere Besten', the poll of the 100 Greatest Germans based on a similar program on BBC. Even though the names were not limited to the 20th century, there was still a huge hole from the Nazi period. For those who are interested how Germans view their own history, the top 10 in alphabetical order are</p>
<p>Konrad Adenauer<br />
Johann S. Bach<br />
Otto v. Bismarck<br />
Willi Brandt<br />
Albert Einstein<br />
Johann W. Goethe<br />
Johannes Gutenberg<br />
Martin Luther<br />
Karl Marx<br />
Hans &amp; Sophie Scholl</p>
<p>All seem worthy, but I'd personally vote for the Scholls, founders of the White Rose resistance during the Third Reich.</p>
