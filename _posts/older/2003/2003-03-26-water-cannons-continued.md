<p>Today the <a href="https://www.papascott.de/2003/03/25/2134.php">police action from Monday</a> appears in a better light. The police apparently warned demonstrators for 20 minutes that water cannons would be used before breaking up the protest. The <a title="SchÃ¼ler-Demo: Erste Anzeigen" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/03/26/138306.html">Abendblatt</a> reports that only two official complaints of police misconduct have been filed. Meanwhile, official investigations have been launched... both into the police action itself, and whether teachers encouraged students to skip school and participate in the protest.</p>
<p>One still has to wonder... throughout Germany there have been massive, peaceful student protests against the war. Only in Hamburg did the protests turn violent. Can you tell us why, Senator 'Law-and-Order' Schill?</p>
