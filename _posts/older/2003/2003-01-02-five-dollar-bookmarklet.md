<p>About the time my New Year's hangover was starting, Phil Ringnalda had come up with a <a title="phil ringnalda dot com: Five dollar bookmarklet" href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002438.php">Five dollar bookmarklet</a> in response to my <a href="https://www.papascott.de/2002/12/31/2056.php">authoring app</a> post. While hacking the MT bookmarklet is a cool idea, and it's handy to know where to do it, it's not really what I had in mind. Of course, I didn't really say what I had in mind. I just made a throwaway cute comment about a two-bit bookmarklet not expecting anyone to take it seriously. </p>
<p>However, if I were designing the million dollar authoring app, off the top of my head, I would expect it to:</p>
<ul>
<li>warn me if I were submitting invalid HTML</li>
<li>suggest tags and attributes that my post may be missing</li>
<li>allow me to drag and drop links into my post</li>
<li>check if the links are on my blogroll, and allow me to add them if they are not</li>
<li>check if the links have RSS feeds, and if so allow me to add them to my aggregator</li>
<li>run with the browser and OS of my choice</li>
</ul>
<p>That's what I was thinking of when I said that a bookmarklet wasn't up to the job. Maybe <a title="Ranchero Software: NetNewsWire Pro 1.0b4" href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/probeta/">NetNewsWire Pro</a>, a news aggregator with posting capability, will become something like this, or <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> can be scripted to do it, or maybe it will be an <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mozilla/">XUL app for Mozilla</a>. Or maybe I'm just dreaming. I don't know.</p>
