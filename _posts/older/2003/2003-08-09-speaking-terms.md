<p><a title="President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld Discuss Progress in Iraq" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/08/20030808-1.html">THE PRESIDENT:</a> "I want to say something about Afghanistan. Germany has taken a very active role in Afghanistan and we're very thankful for that. As NATO steps forward, Germany has assumed a big responsibility. And we really appreciate the German participation. And the reason I bring that up is, is that that's a change from six months ago. And not only is Germany's participation important, it's robust, more robust than we would have anticipated. I look forward to thanking Chancellor Schroeder for that."</p>
<p>All politics aside, it makes me feel a lot better when the president of my native country is on speaking terms with my adopted country. </p>
<p>And, if you're a German unhappy with the current American president, you should be happy too, since Germany has a much better chance to influence American policy when they are speaking (slim) than when they are not (none).</p>
