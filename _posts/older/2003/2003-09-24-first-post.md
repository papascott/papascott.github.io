<p>Note Christopher's toys on the floor, and the box for Papa's new toy on the table in the background.</p>
<p><b>Update</b> Disclaimer: Mama insists I point out that the Lacoste shirt is a hand-me-down from her nephew, and nothing that we would ever have bought ourselves. And Christopher sends special greetings to his Grandpa in Minnesota. Don't forget the honey medicine!</p>
