<p>Just so you know, on the new BMW 500 series the on-board computer monitors the tire pressure for you. But if you ever change the tires (for example, for winter), you have to re-initialize the system. Otherwise the computer will warn you of a flat tire when you have none. That can be very disquieting when doing 200 on the Autobahn. Just so you know.</p>
