<p>Yesterday was the first day of school in Hamburg after spring vacation, but 20,000 students decided to skip class and protest the war. The march attempted to reach the gates of the US Consulate, and <a title="Erst wars friedlich, dann gabs Gewalt - Diskussionen Ã¼ber Polizeieinsatz" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/03/25/137948.html">things</a> <a title="Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | Anti-war protests span the globe" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/antiwar/story/0,12809,920898,00.html">got</a> <a title="novinite.com" href="http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=20874">ugly</a>.
