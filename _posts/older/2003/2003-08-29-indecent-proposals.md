<p>If you're bored and want to practice your German, you can try to make indecent proposals to Eve, the avatar at <a title="YelloStrom" href="http://www.yellostrom.de/">YelloStrom</a>, until she throws a hissy fit and leaves. Or just enter  "zieh dich aus" ('take off your clothes') in the 'Ihre Frage' field and click OK. Don't worry, Eve is always safe for work. More hints for insulting Eve are at <a title="H-BLOG: Zieh dich aus!" href="http://h-blog.org/archives/000410.html">H-Blog</a>.</p>
