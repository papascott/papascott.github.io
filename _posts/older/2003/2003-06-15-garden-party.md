<p>As part of the celebrations of <a href="https://www.papascott.de/2003/06/11/2338.php">Voldemort's birthday</a>, today we are holding the semi-formal garden party for the relatives <em>(mit Erbtante)</em>. Reception with glass of Frexinet at 3pm, coffee and cake at 4pm, light snack at 5:30pm, and hopefully by 6:30pm they get the idea it's time to leave. Tip for hosting such an event: open the first bottle of Frexinet at noon. The perspective is then much brighter.</p>
