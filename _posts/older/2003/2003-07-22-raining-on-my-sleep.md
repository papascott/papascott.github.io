<p>I still insist that 'hot' begins at 40Â°C, but the last couple of days have been 'very warm'. All that energy in the atmosphere has just been discharged in the form of a thunderstorm that chased us from our bedroom in the attic. Drizzle pattering on the skylights might be romantic, but a downpour certainly is not.</p>
<p>We've booked our flight and hotel (burning up some of Mama's Lufthansa miles) for our anniversary getaway to Rome. Lilli <a href="/2003/07/13/2419.php">asked</a> what we're interested in seeing there. Well, we have a cheap guidebook, so we know what the main attractions are. Mama is a militant non-Cathlolic, so we don't need to see the Vatican. We mostly want to stay outside, explore, and catch some atmosphere. And we'd appreciate any tips like 'If you're in Rome for a weekend, you've just got to do <i>this</i>'.</p>
