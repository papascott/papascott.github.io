<p>Today is the 60th anniversary of the beginning of Operation Gomorrah, the firebombing of Hamburg by the British that after 10 days left 40,000 dead, over 1 million homeless, and scars that the city still bears today. A memorial service was held today in the bombed-out <i>Nikolaikirche</i>, today a peace memorial, with Mayor von Beust and the British Ambassador. Our local paper <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de">Hamburger Abendblatt</a> has been running a daily series since Saturday on the bombing, but is only putting text on their web site, no pictures. The series asks the question that cannot be answered and is even more relevant today: When good fights evil, how evil can good allow itself to become?</p>
