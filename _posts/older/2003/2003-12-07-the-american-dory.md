<p>Christopher's Christmas package from Minnesota arrived yesterday. And, I admit it, I just had to take a peek... at the Finding Nemo DVD. Since the film was just released in Germany, it will be months before the DVD is available here. But it's OK. I'm an American citizen. I'm <em>allowed</em> to view Region 1 DVDs.</p>
<p>My main suspicion was confirmed, namely that <a href="http://www.brainpool.de/en/stars/engelke/">Anke Engelke</a>, the German voice of Dory, is a thousand times better than whoever did the original American Dory. But I was also disappointed. Dory's best line ('Kennen wir uns?', when she doesn't recognize Marlin the first time) is a dud in English ('Can I help you?').</p>
