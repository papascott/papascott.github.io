<p>Update: Mark has now <a title="How to hide CSS from Safari: solution [dive into mark]" href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/12.html#how_to_hide_css_from_safari_solution">found</a> a bug to hide CSS from only Safari. He's not quite correct, of course, since the bug also hides CSS from <a title="Konqueror" href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>, which also uses KHTML. But then he tested on only <acronym title="Windows, Macintosh">devilish operating systems</acronym>, and not on systems that are <acronym title="Linux, BSD">good and pure</acronym>.</p>
