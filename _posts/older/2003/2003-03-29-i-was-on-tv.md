<p>According to <a title="Burningbird: Two years of weblogging" href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001022.htm">Burningbird</a>, a link to PapaScott was shown on the NBC Nightly News. They did a piece on warblogs and showed a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=warblogs">Google search</a> where a <a href="/2003/02/11/2098.php">PapaScott page</a> is entry number 3. </p>
<p>Who cares that my paper on warblogs wasn't accepted for the <a href="http://www.blogtalk.net/">BlogTalk conference</a>. I was on TV! Did I look good? Did my hair look alright? Is this something I can put on my resum√©?</p>
