<p>On this anniversary, there are some reminders that all that is violent and evil in the world is not al-Qaida. <a title="BBC NEWS | Europe | German 'neo-Nazi plot' investigated" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3098064.stm">The arrest in Munich of neo-Nazis in possession of 1.7 kg of TNT</a>, or <a title="Guardian Unlimited | The Guardian | Swedish foreign minister dies after stabbing" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1039822,00.html">the stabbing death of Anna Lindh in Stockholm</a>. Or, as a reminder of evil in times past, <a title="Leni Riefenstahl, Filmmaker and Nazi Propagandist, Dies at 101" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/09/obituaries/09CND-RIEF.html?ex=1063771200&amp;en=457e2481312cdf2e&amp;ei=5062">the death of Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl</a>.</p>
<p>Freedom makes us vulnerable, and free people are always at risk. The 'war on terror' won't change that, regardless if the result is win, lose or draw. Maybe it's a mistake to even call it a 'war'. I wonder, if by focusing exclusively on an enemy that inflicted such a painful wound 2 years ago, whether we risk losing sight of other enemies of our freedom, or risk giving up our own freedom in exchange for a false sense of security, or even becoming ourselves the very evil that we are convinced that we fight.</p>
<p>And yet living in freedom is more secure than living under tyranny.</p>
