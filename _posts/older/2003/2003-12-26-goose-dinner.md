<p>Chrismas isn't even over yet, but we are already getting ready for the next <a title="PapaScott : Christopher Ryan Hanson" href="https://www.papascott.de/1999/12/27/">big event</a>. As has been our tradition for the past 4 years, we will once again have <a title="PapaScott : Birthing Christopher" href="https://www.papascott.de/1999/12/30/">goose dinner</a> on December 26th. This year we have a goose breast, with red cabbage from the freezer, and potatoes for the non-Atkins eaters. And we have a story to tell to Christopher.</p>
