<p>I was taken by the new clean design at <a title="From the Orient" href="http://www.dellah.com/orient/">From the Orient</a>, and I decided to adapt it for myself. Since <a href="/2003/01/08/2066.php">I hate editing CSS</a>, I really like the fact that the <a href="/orient.css">stylesheet</a> is very minimal.</p>
