<p>We had a privacy issue crop up in regards to PapaScott, and I took the archives down until I could think of a good solution. Now they are back up, and I've made a subtle change so that certain people looking for a certain thing won't find it here. I won't tell you what it is. It's a privacy issue.</p>
