<p>Today's Economist print-edition article on <a href="http://www.economist.com/World/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4174513" title="German foreign policy | Rebalancing, not realigning | Economist.com">German foreign policy</a> (subscribers only): "What many in Berlin dread most is that Edmund Stoiber, boss of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), insists on being foreign minister. That would give him a top post, but let him stand above the political fray: it is easier to be popular as foreign minister than as, say, finance minister. Yet Mr Stoiber would hate the travelling, says one insider: 'He doesn't even like to leave Bavaria.'"</p>
