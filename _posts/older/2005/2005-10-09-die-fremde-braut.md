She also tells the story of her own family who came to Germany when she was 10. This post is a reminder to myself to read the book. She's also speaking this week at the <a href="http://www.goethe.de/ins/us/bos/en806935.htm" title="Goethe-Institut Boston - Welcome to the Goethe-Institut Boston">Goethe-Institut in Boston</a>, and a short review is at <a href="http://www.signandsight.com/booksthisseason/109.html" title="Politics - signandsight">signandsight</a> (scroll down).</p>
