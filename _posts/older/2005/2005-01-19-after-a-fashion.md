<p>Strangely enough, I haven't seen any German blogs mention the <a title="BBC NEWS | Europe | Man 'confesses' to Munich murder" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4179807.stm">murder</a> of Munich "fashion guru" Rudolph Moshammer, only expat bloggers, and all located in the <a title="Eamonn Fitzgerald's Rainy Day: Mosi & Daisy: a gaudy Gaudi" href="http://www.eamonn.com/archives/001663.html">free</a> <a title="blondelibrarian: And a Little Dog Too!" href="http://www.blondelibrarian.net/blog/archives/2005/01/and_a_little_do.html">state</a><br />
of <a title="My Expatriate Odyssey: Big News in Germany" href="http://expat-odyssey.blogspot.com/2005/01/big-news-in-germany.html">Bavaria</a>, where Moshammer was quite a local celebrity. </p>
<p>Then again, up north we have to put up with Dieter Bohlen, so I don't think we have it any better. He makes the news with hit-and-run encounters, be they with <a title="Bohlen &uuml;ber Fahrerflucht: 'Ich dr&uuml;ck' mich doch nicht vor so etwas' - Panorama - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,337246,00.html">parked cars</a> or <a title="http://www.google.de/search?q=dieter+bohlen+teppichluder" href="http://www.google.de/search?q=dieter+bohlen+teppichluder">carpet saleswomen</a>.</p>
