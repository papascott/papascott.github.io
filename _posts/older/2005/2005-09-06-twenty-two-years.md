<blockquote>We went down to the courthouse<br />
and the judge put it all to rest<br />
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle<br />
No flowers no wedding dress</p></blockquote>
<p>That was twenty-two years ago. Tonight we are getting together after work, leaving Christopher with his Oma, and driving off together to.... a parent-teacher meeting at the kindergarten that neither of us really wants to attend.</p>
<p>We really know <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/09/06/">how</a> <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/06/">to</a> <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/07/">celebrate</a> <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/09/08/">our</a> anniversary, don't we? Or <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/06/">not</a>.</p>
