<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2005/02/20" title="Andrea's Weblog: Sunday, February 20, 2005">Andrea</a> passed the Five Questions meme on to me. Good thing I've been paying attention, I had my answers ready.</p>
<p><strong>1. Total amount of music files on your computer:</strong><br />
<code>moneyball:~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music shanson$ du -sh<br /> <br />
6.5G</code></p>
<p><strong>2. The last CD you bought was:</strong><br />
Depends on what you mean by CD...<br />
The last physical CD I bought was Christmas music for Christopher: "Weihnachten im Kindergarten" by Rolf Zuckowski. The last album I bought at iTunes Music Store was "Gold Medal" by The Donnas last November. The last album I bought at allofmp3.com was "Greatest Hits" by The Bangles last week. </p>
<p><strong>3. What is the song you last listened to before reading this message?</strong><br />
"My Love Will Not Let You Down" by Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p><strong>4. Write down 5 songs you often listen to or that mean a lot to you.</strong><br />
"The River" by Bruce Springsteen<br />
"Best Friend's Girl" by The Cars<br />
"When U Were Mine" by Prince<br />
"Mach Die Augen Zu" by Die &Auml;rzte<br />
"Nur Getr&auml;umt" by Nena  </p>
<p>These are all "I've lost my love and now I've lost my mind" songs, except for Nena. And "Downbound Train" would a more fitting Springsteen song, but I like "The River" better.</p>
<p><strong>5. Who are you going to pass this stick to? (3 persons) and why?</strong><br />
Don't know yet... most everyone I read has already done this.</p>
