<p>Noticed looking at the CD charts at the music store today: Of the <a href="http://stat.allofmp3.com/ratings/charts.shtml?action=DEalbums">top 10 albums in Germany</a>, 7 are by German artists, including 5 of the top 6. The only US album is 50 Cent at number 7. Of the <a href="http://stat.allofmp3.com/ratings/charts.shtml?action=AMERalbums">top 10 albums in the US</a>, only 4 appear in the German Top 50 at all (2 in the high 40s, just barely making it). So I guess German music really is making a comeback.</p>
