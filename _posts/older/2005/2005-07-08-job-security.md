<p><a href="http://chicagokarl.de/2005/07/07/artland" title="">Chicago Karl:</a> "People here in Germany don't get it. I don't want job security that comes from seniority or because my employer isn't allowed to fire me. I want job security provided by an economy that is dynamic enough so that if I do lose my job, I can just go out and find another one."</p>
