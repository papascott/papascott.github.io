<p>Two items from <a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2005/03/23.html" title="John Robb's Weblog">John Robb's Weblog</a> today: one from the New York Times on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/23/international/americas/23mexico.html?ex=1269234000&en=b5d823dd65308c42&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland" title="The New York Times - International - Americas - At Mexican Border, Tunnels, Vile River, Rusty Fence">an elaborate tunnel discovered at the Mexican border</a>, and another on <a href="http://lashawnbarber.com/archives/2005/03/15/interviewi/" title="La Shawn Barber's Corner &raquo; Interview with John Smallberries, Minuteman Project Volunteer">a citizens' militia in Arizona</a> to patrol the border.</p>
<p>This is related to <a href="http://useful-sounds.de/pivot/entry.php?id=160" title="Then they came for the bloggers. | Useful Sounds - Nicole Simon's english [blog|podcast]">Nicole Simon's indignation</a> at the treatment of legitimate travellers entering the United States. That policy, considering the ease with which drugs and terrorists can enter the country from Mexico, is a big sham. And as Nicole points out, people are indignant enough to not travel or work in the US at allow. That's tourist money, business, talent and knowledge that is permanently lost to the US.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to the Times, 80 migrants per year are found dead on the US side of the fence at the Mexican border. Less than 200 Germans were killed during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_wall#The_years_of_the_Wall">the entire history of the Berlin Wall</a>. Which border is more dangerous?</p>
