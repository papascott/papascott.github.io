<p>Like <a href="http://fistfulofeuros.net/archives/001263.php">Tobias</a>, I wish that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin's Law</a> (that any discussion should be ended once anything is compared to Hitler or the Nazis) would be enforced more strictly in German politics, and in <a href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2005/05/goebbels_would_.html">weblogs about Germany</a> as well. (Although strict enforcement in Great Britain would probably shut down the entire tabloid press... which may not be such a bad thing.)</p>
