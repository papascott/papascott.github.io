<p><img alt="redjack.gif" src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/redjack.gif" width="239" height="147" align="right" />We can testify from personal experience that the <a href="http://www.playmobil.com/">Playmobil</a> web site is a fantastic sales builder. Ever since Christopher discovered the online games, it's even more popular than <a href="http://www.superrtl.de/">Super RTL</a> (children's TV channel half-owned by Disney and scourge of responsible German parents). His current favorite is <a href="http://www.playmobil.de/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/de/-/DEM/PM_ViewAbout-Start;sid=fddynYMWMftylMGqlWCxEt_DDX3t4I9T_Ys=?PM_Template=Static%2fgames%2fScreenshots%2fGame13_redjack%2eisml&PHL=RED%20JACK%20-%20DER%20SCHRECKEN%20DER%20L%FCFTE&PLS=0" title="Red Jack - Der Schrecken der L&uuml;fte">Red Jack</a>, in which you aim a cannonball-riding pirate to land in a rowboat. I think that might be teaching Christopher about geometry and physics, but Mama doubts that a 5-year-old can understand much about angles and acceleration.</p>
