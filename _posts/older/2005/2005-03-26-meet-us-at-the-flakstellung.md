<p>Tonight is the annual Easter Fire here in town, the biggest event of the year. Like every year, I got a chuckle from the announcement that it would be held at the <em>Flakstellung</em>. There are no signs or anything, you just have to know that that's the hill outside of town where the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=flak" title="Dictionary.com/flak"><em>Fl(ieger)a(bwehr)k(anone)</em></a> (anti-aircraft artillery) was located during the war.</p>
<p>Or just wait until the bonfire is lit, and follow the smoke.</p>
