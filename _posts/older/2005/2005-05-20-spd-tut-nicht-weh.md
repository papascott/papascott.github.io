<p>The best comment I've heard on Sunday's election in NRW is the fake radio spot in today's <a href="http://www.radiohamburg.de/neu/audio/comedy/radio_hamburg_bundestagskantine_330.mp3"><em>Bundestagkantine</em></a> (MP3, 2.2MB, link will probably disappear tomorrow) in the style of <a href="http://www.wdrmaus.de/"><em>Sendung mit der Maus</em></a>. "Steenbruck is already Minister-President, he knows he can't do it; the dumb R&uuml;ttgers would need to learn that for himself." Or something like that.</p>
