<p><a href="http://www.neilarmstrong.de/weblog/2005_01_01_archive.html#110641950058229935" title="German For Beginners: Bild">German For Beginners</a> on the <em>Bild Zeitung</em>: "Bild is the most popular newspaper in Germany, it's kind of right-wing, a bit down-market and features semi-naked females - it would be instantly recognisable to Britons as 'The Sun with Umlauts'... The newspaper is, and I want to be kind here, absolute and utter crap."</p>
<p>Except of course that The Sun puts its girls on Page 3, while Bild puts them on the front page under the fold. Bild has a deal with McDonald's where you can buy the newspaper in the restaurant, with the latest edition displayed at the entrance. As customers leave the restaurant, they see the back of the paper, and are thus treated to an upside-down Bild-Girl behind glass.</p>
