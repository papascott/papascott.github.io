<p>Duncan rambles on  how we bloggers (among others) <a title="My Expatriate Odyssey: Just me< rambling on about media bias..." href="http://expat-odyssey.blogspot.com/2005/02/just-me-rambling-on-about-media-bias.html">keep ourselves dumb</a>.</p>
<p>> We <span style="font-style: italic;">choose</span> to believe the hype, the conspiracy theories, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">outright lies</span><br />
that are fed to us by the media on a daily basis, and we bloggers seem<br />
quite willing to embellish which ever brand of bias we prescribe too... ItÂ’s too much fun to <span style="font-style: italic;">bash</span> George Bush, and it remains to be too much of a blog traffic <span style="font-style: italic;">magnet</span> to just give up. The same holds true with bashing Hillary. It is, therefore, no surprise that <span style="font-style: italic;">dis</span>information is the literature of choice in the 21st century, as it was in the 20th, and the 19th.</p>
