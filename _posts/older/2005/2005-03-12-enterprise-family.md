<p><a href="http://stern.de/magazin/heft/index.html?id=537409&nv=sb" title="Unternehmen Familie - stern.de"><img alt="stern_familie.jpg" src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/stern_familie.jpg" width="162" height="222" align="right" border="0" /></a> Is is just me, or is there something (or someone) missing from the Stern cover photo for the article <a href="http://stern.de/magazin/heft/index.html?id=537409&nv=sb" title="Unternehmen Familie - stern.de">"Enterprise Family: How modern women manage everday life"</a>? This to me sums up everything that's wrong with the German attitude towards families and children (although I must admit I was so pissed off by the cover that I haven't bothered to read the article).</p>
