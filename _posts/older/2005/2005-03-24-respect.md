<p><a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004373.html" title="Respect for Web Developers (by Jeremy Zawodny)">Jeremy Zawodny:</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>The problem for me, of course, is that the technology has advanced 4-5 years since I swore it off. That's a lot of time on the web.... "I'm pretty smart, but this shit is hard."... I think a lot of people who've been doing "web stuff" long enough think that web developers are the same as the "HTML monkeys" we use to refer to back in the day. That couldn't be farther from the truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>True. That's why I switched from web development to systems administration. Cross-system <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vi</a> compatibility is a lot easier to deal with than cross-system browser (in)compatibility. (Not to mention that I have no design sense at all.) I'll let the experts like <a href="http://couchblog.de/webpropaganda/">couch</a> and <a href="http://www.ichbinharmlos.de/blog/">fab1An</a> make the sites look good. I'll stick to keeping them running.</p>
