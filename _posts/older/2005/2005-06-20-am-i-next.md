<p>Seeing <a href="http://www.sethb.com/weblog/archive/2005/06/iowans_in_iraq.html" title="Seth-Tech: Iowans in Iraq">Seth's post</a> about a Washington Post story on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/19/AR2005061900928_pf.html" title="'Am I Next?'">Iowa National Guard unit in Iraq</a>, a unit which has had 20% casulties, reminded me that the Guard unit from my hometown has been deployed there as well. I've been gone too long to know any of them, except for a kid I used to babysit (he's now 35, a teacher and father of two).  The Economist this week noted that <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4085684" title="The war on terror | That not-winning feeling | Economist.com">opinion in the US is shifting</a> against the war. I wonder whether the deployment of so many Guard units has something to do with that, citizen soldiers being called away from home.</p>
