<p>A lot of people seem to be using my <a href="/archives/2004/09/01/export-from-wordpress/" title="PapaScott: Export from WordPress">Export from WordPress</a> script. Since I'm not using WordPress right now, I haven't been maintaining the script. A better alternative might be the <a href="http://epierce.blog.usf.edu/?p=15" title="Eric Pierce: WPexport 0.2">WPexport</a> plugin by Eric Pierce, since, unlike me, he regularly exports WordPress blogs (for students at the University of South Florida).</p>
