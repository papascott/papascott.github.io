<p>It turned out the <a href="/archives/2005/08/09/bad-tickets/" title="PapaScott &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Bad Tickets">luxury lounge HSV tickets</a> for the match against Bayern weren't so bad after all. We did have seats outside, so we didn't have to stay in the lounge. And the home team <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/soccer/wires/09/24/2080.ap.eu.spt.soc.german.roundup/index.html" title="SI.com - Hamburg ends Bayern's record streak with 2-0 win">ended up winning</a>, beating Bayern for the first time since 1996.</p>
<p>It was my first HSV match <a href="/archives/2004/11/25/monkey-noises/">since 1990</a>. I was very impressed by the atmosphere in the AOL Arena this time, and I'll probably go again (even without the luxury business lounge).</p>
<p>Today's tickets were a gift for Mama's nephew, a huge Bayern fan (who was of course deeply disappointed by the result). Christopher and I were supposed to chaperone, but when Christopher turned out not to be interested, we had a <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2107" title="HSV olÃ© [Lummaland - das Weblog]">ticket left over</a>. <a href="http://frederikesophie.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=226" title="HSV-Mampf [Frederike Sophie]">Rike</a> seemed to enjoy the buffet.</p>
