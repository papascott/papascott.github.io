<p>My wife's home state Schleswig-Holstein held elections today, and it looks like <a title="BBC NEWS | Europe | German poll setback for Schroeder" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4281751.stm">Red-Green has been defeated</a>. The polls showed the SPD 3% ahead of the CDU, but the latest count shows the CDU 2% ahead. Was there really a 5% swing at the last minute, or were the polls wishful thinking from the media?</p>
<p>Interesting that education was a major issue in the campaign, with the CDU for the traditional 3-tiered secondary school system, and the SPD for a unified system more like that in the US. Apparently the German voters are more comfortable with the old system, and I doubt that a change in school system will be a campaign issue this year or next.</p>
