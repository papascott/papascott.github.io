<p>What's worse than the office building management planning a power shutdown from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm on Saturday (and you have vital systems in the building that need to be restarted)?</p>
<p>It's when on Thursday the building management decides to change the shutdown to 5:00 to 7:00 pm, and it's perfect grill weather.</p>
<p>At least I don't have to drive in, since my boss bravely volunteered to turned things back on. I just have to make sure everything works. But I'd rather be grilling.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Power was restored 2 hours later than promised, throroughly ruining our evenings. Of course the machines didn't come right up, Nico had to reset the router. One machine <em>still</em> doesn't have power... that has to wait until Monday. Oh joy.</p>
