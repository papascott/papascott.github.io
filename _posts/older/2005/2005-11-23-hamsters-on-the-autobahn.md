<p>Today on the way to judo Christopher started singing the <a href="http://www.radiohamburg.de/">Radio Hamburg</a> jingle... and we weren't even listening to Radio Hamburg. He then said he wanted to be a radio announcer, and proceeded to give a traffic report. On the Autobahn 7 traffic was being held up by hamsters on the roadway, and the police were asking motorists to avoid running over the hamsters.</p>
<p>He then said it was just a joke, and that there weren't really any hamsters on the autobahn. Too bad that radio announcing seems to be a <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/003521.shtml" title="Random radio by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com">dying profession</a>. I don't even listen to Radio Hamburg, although Mama sometimes turns it on. The parody this morning of Angela Merkel singing Dancing Queen on her first day in office was kind of cute, though.</p>
