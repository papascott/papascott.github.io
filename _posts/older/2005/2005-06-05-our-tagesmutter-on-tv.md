<p><a href="http://www.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/8/0,1872,2307112,00.html" title="ZDF.de"><img alt="sandbox.jpg" src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/sandbox.jpg" width="118" height="88" border="0" align="right" /></a> Christopher's former "day care mother" Heidi was featured today (along with Family Minister Renate Schmidt) on German TV in a <a href="http://www.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/8/0,1872,2307112,00.html" title="ZDF.de - Mit Tabletten ruhig gestellt"> story about home day care in ZDF</a>for the Mona Lisa program. Even if you can't read German, her picture in the sandbox leads the story on the web page.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the story was rather sensationalist, how a unregulated Tagesmutter in Munich used sleeping pills to control the toddlers in her care. Heidi was presented as what a Tagesmutter should be, as well a spokesperson for her professional organization. The film team spent several hours with her, so maybe they will use the material for a future report. Today she was shown for one minute, at the most.</p>
<p>The story, however, ended on a sexist note, as the reporter noted how many working women depend on Tagesm&uuml;tter... as if fathers had no interest in day care at all.</p>
