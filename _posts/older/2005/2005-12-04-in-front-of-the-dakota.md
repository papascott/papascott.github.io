Has it really been that long? It's an event (like the <a href="/archives/2003/01/28/on-this-day-challenger/">Challenger explosion</a>) that I remember vividly and that changed how I felt about myself and the world. I had just started college, I was working at the student radio station at the U of M. Ihad the Sunday morning shift, so I was on the air for the world wide minute of radio silence 6 days after his death.
