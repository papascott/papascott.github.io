<p>To anyone following the company, it's old news that <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_15/b3928086_mz054.htm" title="Wal-Mart: Struggling In Germany">Wal-Mart is struggling In Germany</a>. But a side comment is interesting. "Rivals continue to chuckle about the customer reaction when, initially, Wal-Mart offered services such as grocery bagging. It turned out that Germans didn't want strangers handling their groceries. And when clerks followed orders to smile at shoppers, male customers took it as a come-on." <a href="http://www.ministryofpropaganda.co.uk/2005propaganda/20050404-inspiration.shtml" title="Ministry of Propaganda - 04/Apr/2005: I Need Inspiration">(via Ministry of Propaganda)</a></p>
