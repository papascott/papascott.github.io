<p>In Actual Fact has a <a href="http://www.inactualfact.com/?p=49" title="Advice For The Frequent Flyer">good lost passport story</a>. I'd have a good one too, from a few years ago, but I didn't know it was lost. A couple days after returning from a trip to the States, I couldn't locate my passport. It couldn't be that far away, I obviously had it in my hand when I entered the country. I assumed I had misplaced it when unpacking, and that it would eventually show up.</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks, it hadn't shown up, and I submitted an application for a replacement to the consulate. They called me to say that they had my old passport, so I wouldn't need a new one. Someone had found it at the airport parking lot and had put in a mailbox, and the post sent it to the consulate. Which goes to show that sometimes when something is missing, maybe you really have lost it.</p>
