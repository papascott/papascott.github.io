<p>The <a href="http://www.airbus.com/en/">Airbus</a> plant in Hamburg-Finkenwerder is looking for members of area sports clubs (for example <a href="http://www.blau-weiss-buchholz.de/schlagzeilen/airbus-testen.html" title="Airbus A380 testen">Blau-Weiss Buchholz</a>) to participate in an evacuation test of the <a href="http://www.airbus.com/en/aircraftfamilies/a380/">A380</a> to be conducted in January. The test is to evacuate over 850 passengers the aircraft via the emergency slides within 90 seconds. Applicants must be between 18 and 60, be of normal weight and must pass a medical check. Those accepted will receive 60 Euro, food and a free tour of the plant. (via <a href="http://www.kreiszeitung-wochenblatt.de/">Nordheide Wochenblatt</a>, our weekly shopper)</p>
