<p>It's dangerous to watch news channels with the sound turned off. I glanced at <a href="http://www.n24.de/">N24</a> this afternoon, and they were scrolling headlines from Kyrgyzstan while showing pictures of Peter Harry Carstensen. My first thought was that mobs had stormed the <em>Landtag</em> in Kiel and had forced the the CDU leader into exile. </p>
<p>Given everything that's happened in Schleswig-Holstein the past few weeks, the thought isn't really that far fetched.</p>
