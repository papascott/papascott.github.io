<p>We've just recovered from a massive network outage at blogg.de (as well as the other sites hosted by nu2m.de). We were down for about 6 hours. All interfaces on our router would freeze immediately upon restart, and it took me a while to figure out the cause (it wasn't the router, so I wasted a couple of hours working on that). Everything now seems to be back up. The hard part will be figuring out why it happened and keeping it from happening again.  </p>
<p>I'm the sole admin in Hamburg, and it's been a long, lonely evening.</p>
