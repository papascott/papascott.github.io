<p>Christopher is busy tracing letters in his Laura's Star alphabet book.</p>
<p>Right now Christopher totally enthralled by the <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3831500053">Lauras Stern</a> series of books (available in English as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/188844424X">Laura's Star</a>), in which Laura finds and mends a fallen star. He now dreams of flying in a cardboard rocket, just like Laura.</p>
