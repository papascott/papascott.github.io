<p>I could ask today what operation is more dangerous, guarding a polling place for the Iraqi election, or supervising a carload of 5-year-olds for Christopher's <a href="http://www.fuxis.de/">birthday party</a>. But such a question would be crude, rude and politcally totally incorrect.</p>
<p>I'm not wearing any body armour, I like living on the edge.</p>
