<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/09/sports/baseball/09cubs.html?8hpib" title="Red Sox Arrive to Remind Cubs Who's Left Holding Curse Now - New York Times">Red Sox play in Wrigley Field for first time since 1918</a><br />
<blockquote> In the middle of the sixth inning Tuesday night... the (black) cat bolted from its underground quarters, crossed in front of the Cubs' dugout and leapt into the third-base box seats before security guards could corral it... Cubs Manager Dusty Baker discounted the significance of the appearance of the black cat Tuesday night because it had white paws...</p></blockquote>
<p>This is almost as weird as current German politics. Maybe Schr&ouml;der should start releasing black cats from the Kanzleramt.</p>
