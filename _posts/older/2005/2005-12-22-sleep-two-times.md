<p>Christopher is excited that he only has to sleep two more times until Christmas Eve. Mama and I both agree that we'd rather have another week.</p>
<p>Our Christmas card features the <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/11/26/snow-day/" title="PapaScott &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Snow Day">sled photo</a> from last month. We've done our cards the past few years at the <a href="http://www.cardstore.com/asp/usps/">USPS CardStore</a>, and they mail them for us, too.</p>
