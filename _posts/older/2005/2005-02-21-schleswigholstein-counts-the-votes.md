<p>That's what I get for going to bed early. The official count came out at midnight, and the CDU-FDP have fallen short of a majority by 70 votes. Of the 69 seats in the state parliament, they have 34 to 33 for SPD-Green. </p>
<p>The 2 remaining seats belong the SSW, the Danish minority party exempt from the 5% clause. They won't join a coalition, but would tolerate a minority government. The SSW supports a Scandinavian model for economic and education policies, and are more likely to support a SPD government.</p>
