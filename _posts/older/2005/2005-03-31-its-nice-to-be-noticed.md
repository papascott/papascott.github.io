<p>It's great to make a mistake at work, and then later read in my RSS reader <a href="http://blog.it-luemmel.de/archives/2005/03/31/wo-isn/" title="Krank?: Wo isn">that someone noticed that I screwed up</a>. Yes, blogg.de was down for half an hour. When my boss starts blogging about my screw ups too, then I'll know I'm really in trouble. </p>
<p>For the record, when you add an alias to a network interface and then <a title="Making a Virtual Alias show up with "ifconfig"" href="http://portal.suse.com/sdb/en/2005/02/dcon_alias_labels.html">all of your aliases disappear from ifconfig, you shouldn't panic and assume that you've destroyed your network configuration. If you do panic, you might do something stupid, and then you will really need to drive to your ISP and restart your server.</p>
