<p>In <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html" title="How to Start a Startup">How to Start a Startup</a> Paul Graham explains that formalities aren't so important when starting a company, except: "A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care about the paperwork there, and that there's more of it. Which helps explain why there are not more startups in Germany." <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/005807.html">(via vowe)</a></p>
