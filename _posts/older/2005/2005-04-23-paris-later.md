<p>Since Christopher will be on the North Sea for his <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/04/06/practice-for-freetime/" title="PapaScott: Practice for Freetime">Kindergarten Freetime</a> this week, I could very well have arranged to attend the <a href="http://www.lesblogs.typepad.com/">Les Blogs</a> (that's Les as in French, not Les as in lesbian) conference in Paris on Monday. But since we've never been to Paris, it would be somehow unfair to go to Paris without my wife, wouldn't it? (Although the first vision I have of going to Paris with my wife is losing her like in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0095174">Frantic</a>... would I go jumping on roofs like Harrison Ford to look for her? Let's hope I never have to find out!)</p>
<p>Anyway, I suspect our first trip to Paris will not be a romantic second honeymoon, but rather a visit with Christopher to see the <a href="http://www.disneylandparis.com/">mouse</a> at Disneyland Paris.</p>
