<p>The good news is: I don't have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2">Diabetes mellitus type 2</a>. The flip side is: I'm well on my way to getting it unless I change my lifestyle, fast.</p>
<p>My sister-in-law is a <i>Heilpraktikerin</i> (alternative practitioner) together with her husband, and I've been helping them with their website <a href="http://www.naturheilzentrumdrochtersen.de/">Naturheilzentrum Drochtersen</a>. She's started offering a <a href="http://www.stoffwechselprogramm.com/" title="gesund & aktiv - Pers&ouml;nliches Stoffwechselprogramm">weight-loss program</a> based on optimizing metabolism, and suggested we both start the program together. My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">Body Mass Index</a> is 35, so I could use such a program quite badly (I'm 174 cm tall, I'll let you do the math).</p>
<p>The first step is a comprehensive blood analysis, so she stopped by a couple weeks ago and took our weights and a dozen vials of blood. Among the blood tests was glucose, and mine was at 129 mg/dl, over the healthy maximum. A big yellow flashing warning signal.</p>
<p>To make sure I didn't really already have diabetes, I went in yesterday for a sugar load test. Drink a cup of sugar water on an empty stomach and check the glucose after 1 and 2 hours. My glucose was way too high after 1 hour, but was OK again after 2 hours. My pancreas is still working, but it's under stress.</p>
<p>I now have a list of about 40 foods I am allowed to eat, all with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index">glycemic indices</a> of 50 or less. I need to eat at least 750 g of vegetables and drink 3.5 l of water per day. I need to plan at least 4 hours between meals, and eat no carbohydrates on an empty stomach. I need to take vitamins and spoonful of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linseed_oil">linseed oil</a> daily. And I need to exercise. I've invested in a pair of <a href="http://www.karstadt.de/produktAnzeigen.do?pfad=2973+748244+748245+748269&pid=2556242" title="Asics Gel Foundation Plus">running shoes</a>, and I've started using them.</p>
<p>Since the initial blood test I've lost nearly 2 kg, so it looks like I'm on the right track.</p>
