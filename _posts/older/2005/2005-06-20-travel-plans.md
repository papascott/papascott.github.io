<p>In case anyone is tracking our movements...</p>
<p>* 9-10 July we'll be in Berlin for our <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/04/09/berlin-postponed/">postponed</a> family weekend getaway<br />
* 20 July-3 Aug we'll be in Minnesota visiting family, fishing, relaxing, and maybe catching a couple of ball games<br />
* first week of May 2006 Mama has a conference in Orlando; hopefully we can tack on a couple weeks vacation around that</p>
