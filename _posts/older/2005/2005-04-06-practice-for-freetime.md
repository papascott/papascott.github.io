<p>Tomorrow Christopher's Kindergarten group will be staying there overnight. It's a warm-up for their trip at the end of April, what they call <em>Freizeit</em>, or Freetime, when the group will spend a week at St. Peter Ording on the North Sea. </p>
<p>That's right, in 3 weeks Christopher will be away from home for 5 days.</p>
<p>We weren't sure what to think when we first heard the idea. Four- and five-year-olds, away from home for a week? Isn't that a bit young to be away from one's parents for so long?</p>
<p>But that's exactly the point, to give the kids a sense a sense of accomplishment, to present this with a real problem, a difficult task, and all the tools they need solve it. These are all kids with real handicaps or problems of one sort or another, and self-confidence is a vital ingredient to help them deal with them.</p>
<p>Anyway, tomorrow is the warm-up. They go swimming in the afternoon, go out to eat in the evening (Christopher is ordering fish sticks), and return to their classroom to sleep. We parents are supposed to bring them breakfast the next morning (we are to bring sliced cheese), then bring the kids home since experience shows that they will be too excited (and too tired) for kindergarten that day. </p>
<p>So what are we going to do without Christopher tomorrow evening?</p>
