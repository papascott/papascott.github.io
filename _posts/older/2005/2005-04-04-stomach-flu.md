Every so often the kindergarten sends a slip home telling us that some sickness is making the rounds. Chicken pox, measles, ringworm, flu; anything that kids can get, it's on the list.</p>

Now for the first time, Christopher brought the disease home along with the checklist. He's sick with stomach flu. Probably only a one-day affair, but I was supposed to meet the Telekom at our ISP this morning. Hopefully my colleague didn't mind too much the wake-up call to fill in for me.</p>
