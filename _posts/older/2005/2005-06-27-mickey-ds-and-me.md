She <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/090804G.html">lost weight and improved her cholesterol</a> after 30 days of McDonald's. I imagine the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/">National Review</a> and the <a href="http://cei.org/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a> always stick up for poor defenseless corporations, but the point remains that you can eat stupid anywhere, not just at McDonald's. <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/05/06/8729.html">(via kottke)</a></p>
