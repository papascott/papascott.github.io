<p>Funny, when I first tried to publish the VPN post yesterday, I kept getting the strange error 'Precondition Failed'. PapaTech is hosted at <a href="http://textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>, and it turns out they do some very aggresive filtering with mod_security, including the names of certain Unix commands like 'ssh', 'wget', and 'echo' which can be used in HTTP requests to run commands on unsecure servers. The side-effect is it's not possible to mention 'ssh' (without quotes)  on a site hosted at TextDrive.</p>
<p>Actually, at TextDrive you can <a href="http://kb.textdrive.com/article/disabling-mod_security" title="TextDrive Knowledge Base: Disabling mod_security">disable mod_security in your .htaccess file</a>, or even modify the stock ruleset, but it doesn't work if you proxy lighttpd in front of their Apache, like PapaTech does.</p>
