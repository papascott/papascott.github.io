<p>So I too am helping Google to <a title="Google Blog" href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">Preventing Comment Spam</a> by jumping on the rel="nofollow" bandwagon. Not that's going to prevent much of anything. If comment spam is anything like email spam, we're going to see four waves, each exponentially bigger than the one before: the originators, the copy-cats, the script-kiddies and then the robots. Only the first wave is smart. The rest will never notice that comment spam is no longer doing them any good, and won't bother to quit.</p>
<p>So what actual good does being indexed by Google do me anyway, other than sending me copy-cats, script-kiddies and robots to click on my Google ads?</p>
