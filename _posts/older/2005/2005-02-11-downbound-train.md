<p>Sometimes Hamburg reminds me of a <a title="Downbound Train: brucespringsteen.net: Bruce Springsteen" href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/DownboundTrain.html">Bruce Springsteen song</a>:</p>
<p>> I had a job, I had a girl<br />
> I had something going mister in this world<br />
> I got laid off down at the lumber yard<br />
> Our love went bad, times got hard<br />
> Now I work down at the carwash<br />
> <em>**Where all it ever does is rain**</em><br />
> Don't you feel like you're a rider on a downbound train</p>
