<p><a href="http://typo.papascott.de/">PapaScott on Rails</a>. An experiment. About time I start checking out this <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> fad...</p>
<p>Actually, getting Rails and FastCGI to work at my hoster wasn't all that tough. And as for <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/">typo</a>, there's a few issues to deal with after converting the WordPress database, but I could make it work if I wanted to. And maybe I want to.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've taken down the test Typo blog, but I'm now using it at <a href="http://www.papatech.de/">PapaTech</a>.</p>
