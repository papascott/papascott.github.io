<p><a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/020337.php" title="Instapundit.com">Instapundit: The Sitzpinkler Phenomenon</a> (first <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/019951.php" title="Instapundit.com">mentioned</a> <a href="http://andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_12_19_dish_archive.html#110351921564999523">here</a>) may explain why Americans don't take Germany or German politics very seriously, since the main thing they remember about Germany is the strange toilet. Then again, didn't these Americans wonder what the toilet-bowl shaped brush next to the toilet was for? </p>
<p>And as for Sitzpinkeln itself, if you're man enough to stand up, you're man enough to clean up... otherwise you should remain seated. Right?</p>
