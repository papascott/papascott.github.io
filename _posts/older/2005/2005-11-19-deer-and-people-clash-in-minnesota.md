<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/11/18/urban.deer.ap/index.html">CNN.com - Deer andÂ people clash in Minnesota</a>, right in St. Paul, since in urban areas there are no predators and no hunting. Too many deer is a problem around here too, although it hasn't been as bad the past few years thanks to the unseasonably cold winters.</p>
