<p>The polls haven't yet closed in France for the referendum on the EU Constitution, but Spiegel Online says <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,358084,00.html" title="EU-Referendum: Hohe Wahlbeteiligung in Frankreich - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten">High Turnout in France</a> and that while the opponents had been leading the polls, the lead has "melted away".</p>
<p>Given Spiegel's record on citing polls in the <a href="/archives/2005/02/20/schleswigholstein-votes/">last</a> <a href="/archives/2005/05/22/spd-loses-big-in-nrw/">two</a> German state elections, I take it that means the constitution will decisively lose. I've decided that's probably a good thing. Europe needs to catch its breath.</p>
