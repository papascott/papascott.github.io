<p><a href="http://www.inactualfact.com/?p=155">inactualfact</a> wonders today why all English-language movies and TV series shown here are dubbed into German. I <a href="/archives/2000/08/13/ginger-rennt/" title="PapaScott » Blog Archive » Ginger Rennt">used to be bothered</a> by this, but I'm not anymore, probably because most movies I watch these days are on DVD with an English soundtrack. Anybody want a useless Fargo DVD with German soundtrack only? </p>
<p>What does bother me is that for many movies the title is completely changed in German. How is anyone supposed to know that North By Northwest in German is <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=papascott-21%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.de/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00005A3G5%2526tag=papascott-21%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00005A3G5%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">"The Invisible Third"</a>, or that Animal House is <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=papascott-21%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.de/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00005S6SL%2526tag=papascott-21%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00005S6SL%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">"I Think a Horse Kicked Me"</a>, just to name two examples. You'd think for Animal House they'd at least come up with something with food fights or cucumbers.</p>
<p>As for why everything is dubbed, I imagine it's because it's always been done and now the German audience expects it. Or maybe because the Nazis wanted everything in German. Who knows.</p>
