<p><a href="http://ameisendorf.de/index.php?itemid=326" title="ameisendorf.de: Das Jammern hat sich gelohnt">Thorte's post on the new elections</a> reminded me of the fact that if we were playing <a href="http://aries.mos.org/sixdegrees/">six degrees of separation</a> with German politicians, I'd be closest to Bavarian Interior Minister <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnther_Beckstein">G&uuml;nther Beckstein</a>, the most right-wing politician holding high office in Germany. That might be enough to save my butt when the <a href="http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/theclash/clampdown.html">clampdown</a> comes, but I doubt if I'd be able to help anyone else.</p>
