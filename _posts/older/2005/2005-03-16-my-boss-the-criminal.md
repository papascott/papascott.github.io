<p>I was thinking about going to CeBIT yesterday <a title="Meet & Greet auf der CeBIT [Lummaland - das Weblog]" href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1410">to meet Nico and Heiko</a>, but I didn't have a babysitter (or a suit), and besides, I can meet Nico and Heiko in Hamburg anytime I want (at least when I have a babysitter).</p>
<p>Good thing, since on the train back to Hamburg Nico had a <a title="Ende einer Dienstfahrt [Lummaland - das Weblog]" href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1412">small disagreement</a> with the conductor about his ticket, refused to pay full price, and ended up being handed over to federal agents at the next station. There were <a title="C. Panzer und W. Laux by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com" href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002929.shtml">witnesses</a>.</p>
<p>The stories are in German, but the short moral is that if you upgrade your BahnCard, the Deutsche Bahn may consider tickets booked with your old BahnCard to be invalid. Or not. You might be better off driving. Or flying.</p>
