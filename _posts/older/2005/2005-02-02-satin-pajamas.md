<p>Yesterday the winners of <a title="The Satin Pajama Awards" href="http://fistfulofeuros.net/afoeawards.php">The Satin Pajama Awards</a> were announced at A Fist Full of Euros. I didn't <a href="/archives/2005/01/22/quote-unquote/">mention</a> them until now because I was actually nominated for Best Weblog By An Expatriate and I didn't want to increase my chances of winning (I blog to please myself, not anyone else), although judging by the results (12 out of 659 votes) I didn't have anything to worry about. <a title="Lyssa's Lounge" href="http://www.lyssaslounge.de/peepshow/">Lady Lyssa</a> won Best Weblog from Germany, so the voters obviously have good taste. If you're looking for some good European weblogs, or even a <a title="Au Texas, tout le monde est fou sauf moi" href="http://pasfolle.blogspot.com/">French weblog from Texas</a>, check out the results.</p>
