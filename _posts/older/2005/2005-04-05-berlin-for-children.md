<p>We'll be taking a quick trip to Berlin for the weekend... hopefully the good weather will hold up. We'll get a U-Bahn pass and check out some of the <a href="http://www.berlin-tourist-information.de/english/sightseeing/e_si_berlinprogramme_kinder.php" title="Berlin Tourist Information - Sightseeing">tours for children</a>.</p>
