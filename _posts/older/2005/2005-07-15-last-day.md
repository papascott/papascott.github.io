<p>Yesterday was Christopher's last kindergarten day for the year. It was a bit sad since the two leaders of his clique won't be coming back, and it was also the last day for his favorite <i>Zivi</i> (<a href="http://www.dict.cc/?s=Zivildienstleistender" title="conscientious objector performing community service"><i>Zivildienstleistender</i></a>). Today was the end-of-year fest, and now he has 3-1/2 weeks off. Next year his group will have 8 instead of 9 kids, and the funding for kindergarten will be reduced proportionally (thanks to Christian Wulff's social budget cuts in Niedersachsen... funny how he dropped out of the news after new elections were proposed). </p>
<p>Now Christopher can look forward to flying to see Grandma and Grandpa, and going fishing in Grandpa's boat. Mama and Papa are looking forward to that too.</p>
