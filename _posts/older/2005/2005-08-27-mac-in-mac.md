<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/macmini.jpg" border="0" height="64" width="120" alt="macmini.jpg" align="right" /> On vacation I bought an iPod Shuffle. I couldn't plug it into my old PowerBook, so I had to get a Mac Mini <a href="http://www.cyberport.de/webshop/?DEEP=1005-129">(1.42 GHz / Combo Drive)</a>. </p>
<p>Seriously 'santana' (as in <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlbpa/players/6441">Johan</a>) will be a nice companion to the 500 MHz PowerBook <a href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1638&amp;tag=papascott-21&amp;creative=6742&amp;path=ASIN%2F0393324818">'moneyball'</a>. It has some amenities that moneyball lacks, and is small enough to move around the house if I want to use it upstairs. Managing music will be easier with a single machine for both Slimserver and iTunes (syncing an iPod via 802.11b is a pain). And thanks to <a href="http://www.redstonesoftware.com/vnc.html" title="VNC">OSXvnc</a> I don't even have to sit in front of santana to use it.</p>

<p>Setting up santana was pretty boring. Just plug in a mouse and keyboard (PC keyboard works just fine) and it works.</p>
