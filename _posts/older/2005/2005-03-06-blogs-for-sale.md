<p>Catching up on my reading, I noticed at <a href="http://philringnalda.com/blog/2005/03/such_a_deal.php" title="phil ringnalda dot com: Such a deal">phil ringnalda</a> that Jim Winstead is <a href="http://blo.gs/for-sale.php">selling blo.gs</a>. Too bad, I've used <a href="http://blo.gs/">blo.gs</a> ever since it started, it's still one of my favorite web services, and I'd have paid for a premium service had one ever been offered. blo.gs would be a nice fit for <a href="http://blogg.de/">blogg.de</a>, seeing as nu2m.de is a php/mysql shop. But I'm not sure <a href="http://lumma.de/">Nico</a> wants to expand his empire (and his bandwidth costs) outside the German-speaking blog(g) world.</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck to you Jim, and thanks for all the fish.</p>
