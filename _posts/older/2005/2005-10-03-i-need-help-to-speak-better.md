<p>This evening in the bathtub Christopher suddenly told Mama, "I need help to speak better." This is the first time he's spoken so directly to us about his stuttering.</p>
<p>It's a big step for him, and very timely. His speech therapist has suggested that the time is right for us as parents to become directly involved with his therapy, for us to start attending some sessions and actively participate. We know that she's told him that "Mama and Papa want to help". It's a wonderful sign that he trusts us and himself enough to ask directly.</p>
