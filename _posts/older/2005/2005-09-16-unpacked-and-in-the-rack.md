<p>Just so Nico knows that I take good care of the <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2047" title="Hochkantserver [Lummaland - das Weblog]">toys</a> he buys for me. The bottom two are a week old, the top two are new today. (The locks are just for show, the keys are all in the glove compartment.)</p>
<p>This is my first experience with Dell servers. They are nice and easy to install, I'll take more anytime.</p>
