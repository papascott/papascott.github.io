<p>"An auto-transporter has <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jackknifed&amp;defid=101058">jackknifed</a> in the construction area on the Autobahn A1 between Maschen and Hamburg. The A1 southbound is completely closed, northbound only 1 lane is free. Commuters to Hamburg are advised to completely avoid the A1 and take the A7..." Days like this make me glad I no longer commute.</p>
