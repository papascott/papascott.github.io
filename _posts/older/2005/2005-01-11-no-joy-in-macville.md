<p><a href="http://ahawkins.org/2005/01/11.html#a296" title="code: theWebSocket; : code: theWebSocket;">code: theWebSocket: There is no joy in Macville</a> Well, I can see that the Apple old-timers can't be real happy that Apple is turning into a electronic <a href="http://www.abercrombie.com/">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> outfitter for the iPod generation. On the other hand, can't you see yourself with a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">miniMac</a> or three on your desk?</p>
