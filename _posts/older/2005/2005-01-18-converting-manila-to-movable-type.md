<p><a href="http://q.queso.com/">Jason Levine</a> has now published his script for <a title="QDN: Converting Manila to Movable Type" href="http://q.queso.com/archives/001587">converting Manila to Movable Type</a> (which can then be converted to anything else). He helped <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/">Susan</a> convert 6 months ago (<a href="/archives/2004/06/22/converting-manila/">when I couldn't</a>), and I'm glad his recipe is now available for everyone.</p>
