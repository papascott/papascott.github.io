<p>In the "Sport is stranger than real life" department, in a particularly <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/0,1518,388956,00.html">chippy Bundesliga match</a> last night between Duisburg and K&ouml;ln, the Duisburg coach starts arguing with an opposing player on the sidelines (strange enough). The coach then gives the player a head butt, turns to the TV camera, and falls theatrically to the ground. This is soccer, not American football, nobody's wearing any helmets! Even if you don't read German, you can see the pictures at <a href="http://www.allesaussersport.de/archiv/2005/12/06/schabigster-schauspieler-ever-norbert-meier/" title="allesaussersport &raquo; Sch&auml;bigster Schauspieler e.v.e.r.: Norbert Meier.">allesaussersport</a>.</p>
