<p>We just trimmed our wild roses down to the ground and had several trees removed, and we've discovered things in our backyard that we had forgotten we had. Like natural light. And neighbors.</p>
<p>Update: Here are a couple of 'before' pictures that show how high the roses were. They grow like weeds, so in a year or two they'll be that high again.</p>
