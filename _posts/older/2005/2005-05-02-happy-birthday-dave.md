<p><a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/05/01#aBirthdayRequest">Dave Winer turns 50</a> wants us to push up his Technorati rank as a birthday present. No problem, Dave. Happy birthday, and enjoy your new decade. And remember that <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/05/27/first-impressions-from-amsterdam/">little baby you met in Amsterdam</a> a few years ago? He's now 5 and just <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/05/01/toothy-grin/">lost his first tooth yesterday</a>. So we are all getting older.</p>
<p>Whatever you think of Dave's tone, I've found him to be right more often than not. And it was because of <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">Frontier</a>, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> and EditThisPage.com that I got into web scripting and weblogging, and thanks to that I have the career I have today.</p>
