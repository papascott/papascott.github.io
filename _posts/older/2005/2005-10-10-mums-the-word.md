<p>You know there's some serious action going on under the covers when politicians hide from the press. That's currently the case here, where 3 weeks after the election the Union and SPD are now meeting secretly "under 8 eyes" to hammer out the framework of a grand coalition. There's still some squawking coming from the understudies, but the main players are <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4325600.stm">keeping their mouths shut</a>. </p>
<p>The press thinks it knows what the cabinet could look like... Merkel as Chancellor, SPD with 8 ministries. Whether Schr√∂der can get over his ego to be Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister remains to be seen (my guess is no). But once they start talking to the press again, we'll know they're done. Maybe today.</p>
