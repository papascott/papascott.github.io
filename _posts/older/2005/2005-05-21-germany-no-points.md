<p>It's 10:30, have they started the announcing the votes at the Eurovision Song Contest yet? I'm not turning on the TV until I'm sure the music is over. I only want to watch the results.</p>
<p><strong>Update 0:26:</strong> That title wasn't a prediction. I had no idea Germany would really finish dead last. However, I did enjoy the Ukrainian Pat Sajak clone moderator.</p>
