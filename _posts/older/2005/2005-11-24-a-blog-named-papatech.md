<p>OK, let's see if this works...</p>
<p>In an attempt to separate the exciting stuff from the boring stuff, I've moved all my tech-related posts to a separate weblog, <a href="http://www.papatech.de/">PapaTech</a> (running on Typo under Rails). You can decide for yourself whether you find the expat/personal stuff at PapaScott to be exciting, or the hip/technical stuff at PapaTech, or neither (in which case, why are you even reading this?).</p>
<p>I'm going to try to automatically put summaries of the PapaTech posts at PapaScott, so if things break, that means it's not working yet.</p>
