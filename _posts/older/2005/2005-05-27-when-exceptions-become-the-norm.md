<p><a href="http://slate.msn.com/features/whatistorture/Conclusion.html" title="What is Torture">What Is Torture?</a> is an excellent interactive "primer on American interrogation" at Slate that explains the debate about interrogation techniques used by Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan. It presents a lot of detail without being overwhelming. It's intended to "inform rather than persuade", but it's hard to disagree with the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>What has happened &mdash; a slow slide from coherent, consistent standards for interrogation and treatment of prisoners to a sometimes ad-hoc, occasionally brutal search for information at all costs &mdash; should warrant public outcry. That it has not suggests either that this shift doesn't interest us because it affects outsiders, or that we no longer consider torture or near-torture to be beyond the bounds of civil conduct.</p></blockquote>
