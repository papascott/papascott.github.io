<p>Christopher's speech therapist gave us a homework assignment to ask 3 poeple a question. I'm going to cheat and do it on the Internet, and ask my readers to help me. </p>
<p>What causes people, especially children, to stutter?</p>
<p>Please leave your answer in comments or by mail in either English or German. We're looking for spontaneous opinions, not correct answers, so please don't Google. Thank you!</p>
