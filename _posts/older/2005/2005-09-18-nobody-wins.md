<p>BBC says <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4258376.stm" title="BBC NEWS | World | Europe | 'Slim victory' for German right">'Slim victory' for German right</a>, but I would say that Schr&ouml;der and Merkel both lost. Both SPD and Union lost several percent compared to 2002, neither Red/Green nor Block/Yellow has a majority. The big winners are the neo-liberal FDP (over 10%) and the neo-socialist Left/PDS (over 8%). The most likely result is a grand coalition of Union and SPD, a coalition of losers. </p>
<p>Heiko wonders about a <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/003369.shtml" title="Jamaica coalition by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com">Jamaica coalition</a> of Union/FDP/Greens. That would be a mathematical possibility, but is practically impossible.</p>
