<p>The campaign season started while we were away, and this billboard now stands in front of our local supermarket. "We stand for the courage to wage peace. But what do the others stand for?"</p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure which war the SPD is claiming to have prevented. If they mean Iraq, that certainly didn't work, and sticking one's head in the sand and pretending a problem doesn't exist doesn't exactly require courage. What they really mean is "We stood up to Bush", implying that Angela Merkel wouldn't have. It's a whiff of anti-Americanism, and it will be interesting to see if the SPD takes it any further. </p>
<p>The other interesting thing is the ruling party chose not to use a photo of their candidate, even though Gerhard Schr√∂der is personally more popular than Merkel. Which party is the challenger here? Then again, it's a strange election, where neither party wants to be the incumbant.</p>
<p>This is one of a series of "What do the others stand for?" slogans... other issues the SPD "stands for" include <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-wendler/31724237/in/pool-wahl05/">job protection</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ix/31256013/in/pool-wahl05/">reform</a>,  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-wendler/31131636/in/pool-wahl05/">modern family policy</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-wendler/31130961/in/pool-wahl05/">social justice</a>.
