<p>As you can tell from the downtime notice on <a href="http://blogg.de/">blogg.de</a>, I'm putting in a night shift this evening, moving our servers into a new rack where we have lots of room for expansion. The two hour estimate is a bit pessimistic, but I've learned that what can go wrong usually does go wrong when you are overconfident.</p>
<p>I'm getting too old for all nighters... if it comes to that, it means disaster has struck, and since PapaScott is not located at blogg.de, I'll be able to relate the sad details here. But it's not going to come to that.</p>
