<p>I can't log in to my Bloglines accounts this morning... and it seems like <a title="Technorati: Search for bloglines" href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&url=bloglines">noone else can either</a>. </p>
<p>Of course, if you depend on Bloglines to manage your reading, you'll never read this.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As of 16:15 CET, it seems to be back.</p>
