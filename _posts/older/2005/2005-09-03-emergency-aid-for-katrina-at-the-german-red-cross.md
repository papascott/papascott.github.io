<p>I didn't notice it a couple of days ago, but now you can <a href="http://drk.de/spenden/index.html" title="Spende an das Deutsche Rote Kreuz">donate online for "emergency aid USA" at the German Red Cross</a>. The donations are tax-deductible in Germany and you can pay by German bank transfer.</p>
