<p>It's probably been around forever, but I just found that our <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html">SqueezeBox</a> music player includes a geographic list of online radio stations from <a href="http://radiotime.com/">RadioGuide</a>. So if you want to pretend you are in <a href="http://radiotime.com/region/c_100016/Minneapolis-St_Paul.aspx">Minneapolis</a> or <a href="http://radiotime.com/region/c_100015/Phoenix.aspx">Phoenix</a> or <a href="http://radiotime.com/region/c_100766/Hamburg.aspx">Hamburg</a> or any other place you used to live, you can at least get the soundtrack right (if you can deal with the time difference).</p>
<p>I've spent the evening listening to <a href="http://www.cities97.com/">Cities97</a>, just like we did back in the 80s. Back then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTCZ">their adult contemporary format</a> was revolutionary. These days they're owned by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Channel_Communications">ClearChannel</a>, but they sound remarkably like I remember them in the '80s. It must be the new retro.</p>
