<p>I was able to talk with my brother this evening. The pain is down to where he can sleep, albeit restlessly. The new CT scan revealed a large mass in his abdomen, and he's waiting rather impatiently for a biopsy to be performed. Only then will they know what the next step will be, either chemotherapy or surgery.</p>
<p>I told him about the <a href="/archives/2006/03/05/life-sucks/">T-shirt</a>, and he wants one. It's on its way.  </p>
