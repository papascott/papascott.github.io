<p>My absentee ballot for the November election arrived today. The fine folks at the Maricopa County Elections Department in Arizona are very good in that regard, I don't even have to request it. The races aren't all that exciting, Jon Kyl will be easily re-elected to the Senate and the Democrats don't even have a candidate to face Jeff Flake in my House district, but it's the thought that counts.</p>
<p>If you're an expat and still need an absentee ballot, you can get more information at <a href="http://www.overseasvotefoundation.org/">Overseas Vote Foundation</a> (non-partisan) or <a href="http://www.votefromabroad.org/">VoteFromAbroad.org</a> (sponsored by <a href="http://www.democratsabroad.org/">Democrats Abroad</a>) or <a href="http://www.republicansabroad.org/states.html">Republicans Abroad</a>.</p>
