<p>In elections yesterday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the poorest German state, the far-right National Democratic Party <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5349696.stm">earned 7.3% of the vote</a>, enough to enter parliament. As always when the far-right does well in an election, there is much wailing and gnashing of teeth in the German media. Doug Merrill at A Fistful of Euros is <a href="http://fistfulofeuros.net/archives/002683.php" title="Sandy Brown Baltic Shores">not quite so hysterical</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  On the whole, though, Id be cautiously optimistic... in a state with 18 percent unemployment, the extremist vote was below 10 percent. ... the far right has ebbed and flowed throughout the postwar period, and its never gotten anywhere close to a share of power at the national level... (finally) the far right tends to fractiousness, as the disintegration of the NPD parliamentary party in Saxony in late 2005 most recently showed.</p>
<p>  One in 14 voters in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is willing to cast a ballot for right-wing whackjobs. That, for better or for worse, is probably not too far from the European norm.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Neo-Nazis aren't interested in politics, they just like the sound of their own voice. I'd be more worried about the low turnout (59.2%), which means a good share of the voters aren't interested in politics either.</p>
