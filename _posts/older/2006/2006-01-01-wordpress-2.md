<p>Yesterday I updated PapaScott to<a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/12/wp2/"> Wordpress 2</a>. I haven't looked all that closely at it, but all the plugins I use still work and posting with MarsEdit is quite a bit faster. However, my two main pet peeves with Wordpress remain. First, there is no export function (so if you want to move your Wordpress blog to another system, prepare to learn a lot of SQL). Second, if you want to move a site to a new URL (if you want to test a new version, for example) you have to edit the database manually (otherwise the admin pages all redirect to the old URL). </p>
