<p>I've won new respect for the University of California Berkeley after reading about the <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/03/basketball_pran.html">Basketball Prank</a> at Cal: </p>
<blockquote><p>Victoria was a hoax UCLA co-ed, created by Cal's Rally Committee. For the previous week, "she" had been chatting with Gabe Pruitt, USC's starting guard, over AOL Instant Messenger. It got serious. Pruitt and several of his teammates made plans to go to Westwood after the game so that they could party with Victoria and her friends.</p>
<p>On Saturday, at the game, when Pruitt was introduced in the starting lineup, the chants began: "Victoria, Victoria." One of the fans held up a sign with her phone number.</p>
<p>The look on Pruitt's face when he turned to the bench after the first Victoria chant was priceless. </p></blockquote>
<p>My boss went to Cal, I could imagine him participating in something like this.</p>
