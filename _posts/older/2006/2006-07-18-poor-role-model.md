<p>When Christopher was born, his uncle gave him a framed print of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a> for his bedroom.</p>
<p>This week Christopher discovered a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0836218256">book</a> to go along with with his print.</p>
<p>I think he's just found a very poor role model. I suspect that was his uncle's plan all along.</p>
