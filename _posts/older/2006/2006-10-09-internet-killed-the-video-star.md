<p>When I was in high school in the '70s, you could only see good music on TV late night on weekends on shows like <a href="http://www.jumptheshark.com/d/donkirshner.htm">Don Kirschner's Rock Concert</a> or <a href="http://timstvshowcase.com/midnight.html">The Midnight Special</a>. Some bands started to make little films that went along with their music, and (according to my friends) I said that would someday the all the rage, that watching music would be bigger business than listening to music. My friends said I was crazy, but some years later MTV was born. I never saw a cent from Viacom. (I actually don't rememeber saying that, but my high school friends insisted I was a true visionary. They also said I was a cross between Spock and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman">Alfred E. Neuman</a>, so I can never be sure if they were putting me on or not.)</p>
<p>Of course these days noone watches music, MTV doesn't even show music videos anymore, they're all pirated and downloaded to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>. I always thought YouTube was a stupid idea, playing other people's videos that nobody pays for. How do they make any money? I guessed I missed the point, since today <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?dist=newsfinder&amp;siteid=mktw&amp;guid=%7BFADE6E8C-1E83-4177-817E-14A0D5E18ABD%7D">Google is buying YouTube for $1.65 billion</a>, even though "YouTube right now generates very little, if any, actual revenues, analysts say".</p>
<p>So if any of my old friends are reading, I've lost the touch. I have no idea what's cool anymore.</p>
