<p>The New York Times has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/weekinreview/23landler.html?ex=1303444800&en=8a6469dd6aaa6482&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss" title="Quoth the Raven: I Bake Cookies, Too - New York Times">profile of Ursula von der Leyen</a>, German Family Minister and the most colorful and controversial member of Angela Merkel's mostly colorless cabinet. I didn't realize she had worked in the US, which explains how she picked up her decidedly un-German ideas on working mothers. The article doesn't mention her father (long-time Lower Saxony Premier Ernst Albrecht). Her maiden name was her head start in the CDU, but she's now gone too far for it to be of any advantage to her now.</p>
