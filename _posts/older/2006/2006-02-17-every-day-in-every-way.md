<p>I used to think that "Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better" was just a silly quote from a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075066/" title="The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976)">Pink Panther movie</a> (it's Dreyfus' mantra in the mental hospital), and was thinking of making it the tagline for PapaScott. But <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Every+day%2C+in+every+way%2C+I+am+getting+better+and+better.%22" title="Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better. - Google Search">searching</a> for the exact quote on Google revealed that it is actually a serious self-help philosophy. How boring. And disappointing. </p>
