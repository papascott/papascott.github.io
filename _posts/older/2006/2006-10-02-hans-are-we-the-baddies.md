<p>The British have always had a somewhat disturbing obsession with Nazis, but the comedy sketch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO5WoLnOOlU">The Anxious Nazis</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Mitchell_and_Webb_Look">That Mitchell and Webb Look</a> is perhaps a sign they are getting over it (translation: it's both poignant and funny as hell). You don't suppose they're really talking about the war on terror, do you? (via <a href="http://www.spreeblick.com/2006/10/02/sind-wir-etwa-die-bosen/">Spreeblick</a>)</p>
