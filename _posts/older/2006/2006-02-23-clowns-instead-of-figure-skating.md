<p>For NBC, the Olympic figure skating final is <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/torino2006/news?slug=km-nbcfigs022306&prov=yhoo&type=lgns" title="The big show - Turin 2006 Winter Olympics - Yahoo! Sports">the big show</a>, almost as big as the Super Bowl. For the German TV network ZDF it's no show at all. Olympic programming this evening has been pre-empted for live coverage of <a href="http://www.zdf.de/ZDFde/einzelsendung/6/0,1970,2650470,00.html" title="ZDF.de - Einzelsendung"><em>Karneval</em> in Cologne</a>. Figure skating fans here have to wait for the late night wrapup... or switch to <a href="http://eurosport.com/" title="Eurosport - The torino winter olympics live and in video">Eurosport</a>, where the Olympic coverage is better anyway. </p>
