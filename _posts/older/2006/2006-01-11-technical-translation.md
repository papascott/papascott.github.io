<p>A friend of my sister-in-law is looking for a technical translator, and<br />
she thought that perhaps a reader of PapaScott might be qualified and<br />
interested in the job:</p>
<p>"Who is able to either correct a translation of a technical text from<br />
German into English or to translate it totally on his own? The text to<br />
be translated is the homepage of a German company (see<br />
<a href="http://www.sintertechnik.com">http://www.sintertechnik.com</a>), and the translator should have some<br />
knowledge in areas such as high performance technical ceramics (for<br />
example ceramic bearings), development and processing of specific<br />
ceramic powders to the pressing and firing of ceramical parts (like<br />
spray-dried powders), as well as electroceramics (EMC- Electromagnetic<br />
compatibility, VDR - voltage dependant resistors, multilayers, capacitors).</p>
<p>"If you think that you are the right person for this task, please<br />
contact me at <a href="mailto:jurgen@schell.elcom.ru">jurgen@schell.elcom.ru</a>."</p>
