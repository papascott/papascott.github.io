<p>This is as cool as anything from Apple: <a href="http://www.inchwormshoes.com/index.php" title="Inchworm Shoes Online">shoes that grow with your kids!</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Built right into INCHworm shoes is the <a href="http://www.inchwormshoes.com/tech.php">iFit technology</a>. The iFit technology allows you to GROW the size of the shoe with a simple push of the button. So eliminate unnecessary trips to the shoe store and provide your children with better fitting shoes that last up to three sizes longer. Inchworm shoes grow in half size increments. Just push the button on the side, and pull the toe of the shoe to adjust into the next size.</p></blockquote>
