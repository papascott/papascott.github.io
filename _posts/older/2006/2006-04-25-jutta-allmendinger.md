<p>Since I'm collecting examples of prominent working mothers, I'll mention <a href="http://www.iab.de/asp/mitarbeiterDB/showMitarbeiter.asp?pkyMitarbeiter=181" title="Mitarbeiter-Datenbank">Prof. Jutta Allmendinger</a>, Director of the Institut f&uuml;r Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (Institute for Labor Market and Employment Research). I heard her on the radio a month or so ago. She explained how during her studies in the States it was natural for female students and professors to continue their work soon after having children, so she did the same. I was reminded of her since she was a co-author of the <a href="http://www.bmfsfj.de/Kategorien/Forschungsnetz/forschungsberichte,did=75114.html">Family Report</a> issued by Ursula von der Leyen's Family Ministry today.</p>
<p>The working mother in our household had heard of her as well. Prof. Allmendinger spoke at a <a href="http://www.bmfsfj.de/Kategorien/Presse/pressemitteilungen,did=73002.html">European day care congress</a> in March at which my wife was part of a panel. </p>
