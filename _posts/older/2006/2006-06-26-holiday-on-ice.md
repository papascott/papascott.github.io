<p><a href="http://www.spreeblick.com/2006/06/26/eishockey/">Spreeblick</a> asks if the World Cup fiasco last night between <a href="http://www.spreeblick.com/2006/06/26/eishockey/">Portugal and Holland</a> was perhaps ice hockey instead of a soccer match.</p>
<p>I doubt it. I've never seen an ice hockey game as dirty as that, or with such poor officiating.</p>
