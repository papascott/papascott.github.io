<p>"Is there still a God?"</p>
<p>"Why is he in heaven?"</p>
<p>"Who are his customers?"</p>
<p>"Are the angels his customers?"</p>
<p>"What services does God perform?"</p>
<p>Where does Christopher come up with questions like this? Is he being a philosopher or a business analyst? (He really used the words "Kunden" and "Leistungen".) At least his final statement on religion ("In heaven it gets dark on time.") seemed more appropriate for his age.</p>
