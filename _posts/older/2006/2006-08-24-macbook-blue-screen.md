<p>My MacBook wouldn't wake up this morning, and worse than that, it wouldn't even start. It would chime and get stuck on a blue screen, the default background color (nicer than Windows blue screen), similar to the problem described <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=222380">here</a>.</p>
<p>I started from the Install DVD, and after that the installed system started up just fine, but it was unnerving nonetheless. So <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/08/15.html#yesVirginiaMacsCrashToo">Macs really do crash</a>... :-)</p>
