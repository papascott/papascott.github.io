<p>On Sunday Christopher and I left MamaMaus with her injured foot at home to check out the last day of the <a href="http://www.fanfest.hamburg.de/">World Cup FanFest</a> in Hamburg. In his Italia shirt he fit right in.</p>

<p>First he had to try out the trampoline.</p>

<p>Flying at the Heiligengeistfeld. (Update: I just realized that's my old office building in the background. <a href="http://www.netlife.de/">Netlife</a> RIP. The color is washed out because the sky was really dark, and I had to lighten up the picture to show Christopher's smile.)</p>

<p>It started to rain, so we went inside to the foosball tables.</p>

<p>When the weather cleared, we tried out the life-sized version.</p>
