<p>I should pay better attention to Slashdot, then I would have known that <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/06/09/28/1517229.shtml">Germany has been invaded by a giant insect</a>. The <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;t=k&amp;q=Germany&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=18&amp;ll=48.857699,10.205451&amp;spn=0.002404,0.006738&amp;om=1">proof is at Google Maps</a>. Good thing that I saw this at <a href="http://www.margaret-marks.com/Transblawg/archives/002106.html">Transblawg</a>, I might still have time to protect our home by activating our giant insect defences.</p>
