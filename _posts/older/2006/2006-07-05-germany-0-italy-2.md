<p>I've been meaning to post something more on last night's game, but instead I'll point to a couple of tech bloggers who've written about it, namely Matthew Langham who explains how <a href="http://www.silentpenguin.com/archives/2006/07/germany_loses_a_1.html">Germany won</a> even though the team lost, and Tim Bray who says it was <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/04/Germany-0-Italy-2">what soccer was meant to be</a>.</p>
<p>My thought as it ended was the fastest 118 minutes of scoreless soccer I've ever watched, and that it was a game to remember for a couple of decades, since (due to tournament seedings) good teams face one another so seldom in in non-friendlies. The last time Germany and Italy met in a World Cup was the first Cup I closely watched (and rooted for Germany), the final in 1982.</p>
