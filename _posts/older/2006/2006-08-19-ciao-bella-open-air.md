<p>Just 24 hours after our return to Germany, our neighbor is holding an <a href="http://www.soulfulrock.de/" title="Ciao Bella - Soulful Rock from the Heart of Texas">open-air</a> <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2006/08/09/595917.html">concert</a> in his farmyard, with the band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ciaobellaband">Ciao Bella</a> touring from Texas. We've never had any concerts in LÃ¼llau that I can recall.</p>
<p>Maybe I should offer not to report the noise to the police in return for free beer.</p>
