<p><a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0740748475"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/papascott/image/upload/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/the_complete_calvin_and_hobbes.jpg" alt="the complete calvin and hobbes" align="right" border="0" /></a> Thanks to <a href="http://serendipita.org/2006/07/20/theres-treasure-everywhere/">Andrea</a>, we found that Amazon.de is offering <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0740748475">The Complete Calvin and Hobbes</a> for just EUR 63.89, less than half the list price. So we got one. At 10 kg, it's not light reading, but it's everything a Calvin and Hobbes fan could hope for (short of a rivival of the daily comic strip).</p>
<p>Calvin and Hobbes has (for now) replaced Harry Potter as Christopher's bedtime reading (with on-the-fly translation by Papa). Since he's Calvin's age, I think he sees the stories not so much as humor than as absolute truth.</p>
