<p>Jean-Remy von Matt is head of the <a href="http://www.jvm.de/">Jung von Matt</a> ad agency which concieved the "Du bist Deutschland" campaign. A lot of German bloggers have expressed the opinion that the campaign is baloney, and so it's no surprise that Herr von Matt <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2458" title="Klow&auml;nde des Internets [Lummaland - das Weblog]">doesn't like weblogs</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Weblogs, the bathroom walls of the internet. What gives every PC user the right to excrete* their opinions? Most bloggers simply excrete. This new low point in the building of opinions is clear when one searches for 'Du bist Deutschland' at <a href="http://www.technorati.com">www.technorati.com</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nico Lumma is only too happy to oblige big media types, so just for Herr von Matt he presents the site <a href="http://klowaende.de/">klowaende.de</a>, which is basically <a href="http://blogg.de/">blogg.de</a> with a bathroom wall skin.</p>
<p>*Translator's note: the German original uses the verb 'absondern', which is a new word for me. It means to secrete, excrete or lactate, but also means to separate. It may have a slang meaning which I'm totally missing.</p>
