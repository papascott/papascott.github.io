<p>Easter Monday is one of those holidays we've never gotten into. We usually end up doing some sort of home improvement project like painting or wallpapering. Today we sorted out outdated toys, a big chore since Christopher seems to have inherited my sense of organizations (stack and pile). Our Tagesmutter will be happy for the pile of outsorted toys.</p>
<p>It'd be great to be able to sit in the garden, but the weather is a month behind schedule and we've got standing water on the lawn. No walking on the grass without rubber boots. </p>
<p>Christopher was home sick all last week, by Friday we were both tired of being stuck home together. He was healthy enough for the Easter fire Saturday night, but we didn't stay long. Yesterday we searched for Easter eggs in the mud and took Oma out for Easter dinner. </p>
