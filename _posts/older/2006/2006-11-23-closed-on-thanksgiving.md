<p>If there's one thing you can say that applies to all Americans, it's that you can't say anything that applies to all Americans.</p>
<p>Today is Thanksgiving in the States, but it's not a holiday that I particularly miss. Yes, as a child we celebrated Thanksgiving with a turkey dinner like everyone does, and no, I had no particularly traumatic experiences associated with Thanksgiving. But for me, Christmas was always the highlight of the year. Thanksgiving was more of a <abbr title="White Anglo-Saxon Protestant">WASP</abbr> thing, and as Scandinavians, we came a couple of centuries late to the party.</p>
<p>My biggest memories of Thanksgiving are a couple of extremely cold bus rides home from college for the long weekend, once in a blizzard, and another time in a blizzard during a bus drivers' strike.</p>
<p>Maybe tonight I'll bring home a some roast turkey cold cuts to enjoy with our German <em>Abendbrot</em>. Happy Thanksgiving, and remember, the <a href="http://www.arlo.net/resources/lyrics/alices.shtml">dump is closed</a>.</p>
