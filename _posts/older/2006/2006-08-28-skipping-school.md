<p>I doubt if Christopher's first day of first grade on Saturday will be <a href="http://www.beagooddad.com/39/first-day-of-school-in-hammond-indiana/" title="Be A Good Dad » Archives » First day of school in Hammond, Indiana">anything like this</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ah, the first day of school.  Catching up with friends you have not seen all summer.  Hoping that none of your teachers assign homework on the first day of school.  Dreaming of the first snow day.  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/27/ap/strange/mainD8JOI4E81.shtml">Getting suspended.</a>...  Well, I normally tried to avoid the last one, but last week, 128 out of 1200 students at Morton High School were sent home for wearing inappropriate clothes....  baggy pants, low-cut shirts, tank tops, graphic T-shirtsand cell phone use.

<p>So if you wear the wrong clothes, you get to skip school. I would have loved to have known that when I was in high school.</p>
