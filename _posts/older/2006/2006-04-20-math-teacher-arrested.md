<p>Another victory in the war on terror: <a href="http://info.interactivist.net/article.pl?sid=06/04/18/1633231" title="Interactivist Info Exchange | US Detains Al-Gebra Operative">US Detains Al-Gebra Operative</a> (as seen at <a href="http://www.spreeblick.com/2006/04/20/mathe-lehrer-festgenommen/">Spreeblick</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>At New York's Kennedy airport today, an individual later discovered to be a public school teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a slide rule, and a calculator.</p>
<p>At a morning press conference, US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said he believes the man is a member of the notorious al-gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math's instruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al-gebra is a fearsome cult,&rdquo; Gonzales said. &ldquo;They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as 'unknowns', but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'there are 3 sides to every triangle'.&rdquo;</p>
