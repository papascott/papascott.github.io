<p><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BDD36AF44%2D9E8D%2D413A%2DBE18%2D3CEAB8861FB5%7D">Wal-Mart Stores to exit Germany</a> after 8 years, selling their 85 locations to the Metro Group and taking a $1 billion write-off. Their culture was alien to both employees and consumers, and they never grew big enough to compete with established discounters like Aldi.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> There's a nice discussion (in German) on <a href="http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/3922-Wal-Mart-zieht-sich-aus-Deutschland-zurueck.html">why Wal-Mart failed</a> at the <a href="http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/">Shopblogger</a>.</p>
