<p>Raskal Trippin wants a logo to warn expat women <a href="http://raskal.typepad.com/raskal_trippin/2006/10/dont_get_pregna.html">Don't Get Pregnant in Europe</a>. She's had to defend herself for not drinking, avoiding coffee, simply being American, and then there's the insensitive receptionists:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  (We need) an image that effectively communicates to OB/GYN receptionists that the correct response to "I've had a positive pregnancy test and would like to schedule appointment as soon as possible" is not "Do you plan to keep it?" (And people wonder why folks don't have kids in Germany?)</p>
<p>  A Don't Get Pregnant in Europe logo - It's just a pain having to explain the differences on both sides of the ocean. Even if it costs 5 euros compared to the 5000 euros it would cost back home, don't do it.
