<p>Back before the fall election I <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/06/02/experience-not-required/" title="PapaScott &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Experience Not Required">wondered</a> whether Angela Merkel had the right stuff and experience to lead a national government, since she had never acutally led a government of any type, only a party. Turns out that instead of a government she got a grand coalition, and her experience herding the Kindergarten boys Stoiber, Koch and Wulff was perhaps the perfect training not only for shepherding junior coalition partners, but for foreign policy as well.</p>
<p>First she <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4537674.stm" title="BBC NEWS | World | Europe | Angela Merkel's 'EU triumph'">soothed</a> the Polish beast with a few billion euros to save the EU budget summit. Then she <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1855733,00.html" title="Bush and Merkel Hail New Chapter in US-German Relations | Germany | Deutsche Welle | 13.01.2006">manages</a> to satisfy domestic opinion and get on George W's good side during her first visit to Washington (the trick: announce in advance that we don't like Guantanamo, but say it very softly, and don't press the point). And today she <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1858256,00.html">tells Putin</a> that even though she speaks Russian, she's not his buddy like Schr&ouml;der was. </p>
<p>I thought it was interesting that George W. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060113-1.html">remarked</a> that it was "uplifting to talk to somebody who knows the difference between just talking about tyranny and living in freedom and actually done it". I know serving as a minister in the Kohl cabinet was tough, but I wouldn't go quite that far.</p>
