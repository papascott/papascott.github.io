<p>We went to see the musical version of <a href="http://tivoli.de/index.php?id=event843">Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivfuhrer</a> at the Schmidt Theatre in Hamburg yesterday. As you can see, Christopher was very happy to have his picture (a scan of a polaroid) taken with the star. We can highly recommend it.</p>
<p>As a bonus, here's the annual Christmas Cookie Cutter picture.</p>
