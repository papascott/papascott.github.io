<p>From an article on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/education/08germany.html">Jacobs University Bremen</a> (via <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2006/11/private_donatio.html">German Joys</a>), which recently changed its name after receiving a $250 million donations from a certain Herr Jacobs:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  German universities lack the resources of their American rivals. The United States spends 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product on higher education; the Germans, only 1.1 percent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess because Germany would rather spend money on the past (like coal subsidies) than on the future. The closing quote was also cute.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Why didnt Mr. Jacobs give his millions to his own alma mater, the University of Hamburg? They didnt ask.
</p></blockquote>
