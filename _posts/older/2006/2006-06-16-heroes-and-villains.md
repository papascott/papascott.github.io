<p>The thing that's so cool about the World Cup, and soccer in general, is that it's so blatantly emotional and subjective. </p>
<p>Take the past couple of days. There have been 3 games (Germany - Poland, England - Trinidad and Tobago, Sweden - Paraguay) where the plot line has been basically the same. The favorite struggles to score against a defensive underdog and can only win by scoring very late. </p>
<p>In the first, the <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/matchreport/0,,1797918,00.html" title="Guardian Unlimited Football | World Cup 2006 | Heartbreak for Poles as Neuville grabs last-gasp winner">heroes</a> were persistent and courageous, and the result was a just reward for tenaciousness and hard work.</p>
<p>In the second, the <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2057125,00.html" title="England Struggle to 2-0 Win Against Trinidad and Tobago | Match Reports | Deutsche Welle | 15.06.2006">villains</a> were confused and inept, and the result was simply a great stroke of luck.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/iht/2006/06/16/sports/IHT-16websweden.html" title="Sweden 1, Paraguay 0: Big-Name Attack Struggles but Survives on Late Strike - New York Times">third</a> was so boring that I switched it off.</p>
