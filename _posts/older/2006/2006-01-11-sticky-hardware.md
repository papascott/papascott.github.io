<p>This week we threw some more hardware at blogg.de and the other websites hosted by nu2m. This time it seems to be sticking to the wall (like <a href="http://photomatt.net/2006/01/05/wpcom-performance/">noodles</a> when they're done). 12 must be our lucky number:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 webservers</li>
<li>3 database servers</li>
<li>2 load balancers</li>
<li>and a firewall in a pear tree</li>
</ul>
<p>The rack isn't full yet, but the switch and the power strips are now maxed out. </p>
