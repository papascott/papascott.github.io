<p><a href="http://www.mcwetboy.net/dfl/" title="DFL">DFL</a> is a weblog devoted to last place finishes (you have to finish to be noted) at the Olympics. Unlike <a href="http://davespicks.com/archive/2006/02/13.html#1139659566" title="13. February, 2006 - Monday the thirteenth">Dave</a>, though, I know what the acronym <a href="http://www.mcwetboy.net/dfl/2006/02/frequently-asked-questions.html" title="DFL: Frequently Asked Questions">DFL stands for</a>.</p>
