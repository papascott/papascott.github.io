<p>We've been busy this week, with Christmas, Christopher's birthday, and his Grandmother visiting for 2 weeks. We spent New Years Eve at home and managed to hit a number of <a href="http://german.about.com/library/blsilvester.htm">German New Year's Customs</a>, eating raclette (with enough leftovers for a repeat performance tonight), drinking <em>Feuerzangenbowle</em>, and watching <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2133551">"Dinner For One"</a> (twice). We skipped the <em>Bleigiessen</em> and the jelly doughnuts. Christopher and I instead napped for a bit before midnight to rest up for the fireworks. Sounds like our evening was pretty much like at <a href="http://justcallmemausi.blogspot.com/2005/12/einen-guten-rutsch-in-das-neue-jahr.html">Christina's</a>, where you can read what the New Year's greeting "Guten Rutsch" really means.</p>
<p>Alas, tomorrow is the start of a normal work and kindergarten week. Mama even gets to fly to Munich overnight to start the year. Grandma will be here all week, though.</p>
