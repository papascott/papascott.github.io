<p>I think I've complained before that the concept of substitute teachers is unknown in Germany. If a teacher is sick or doesn't show up for some reason, they send the kids home.</p>
<p>In that sense we're lucky, Jesteburg has a <em><a href="http://www.gsjesteburg.de/konzept/aufsatz/en.html">Volle Halbtagsschule</a></em>, "full half-day school" (the link is even in English), which means the children aren't just supervised during empty hours, but are guaranteed to have 5 hours of instruction with certified teachers each day. The concept was tested in Lower Saxony in the '90s, but was discontinued and replaced with the cheaper <em>verl&auml;ssliche Grundschule</em>. Our local school fought to keep their system and won.</p>
<p>For first graders the school day is only 4 hours, though, mornings from 8 to 12. I'm not sure if anyone would want to employ a sys admin who has to be home by noon every day. </p>
