<p>MamaMaus reports from Munich. She's at a 2 star hotel with 5 star World Cup rates this week for business meetings before the World Cup opener on Friday. The hotel was apparently was last redecorated for the previous big sports event in Munich, the 1972 Olympics. Her meeting for Thursday was cancelled, she booked a flight home so she can sleep in her own bed one night before returning for the opening match and the hotel lost in the '70s Friday night. She may have VIP tickets, but her hotel is lost in the twilight zone.</p>
