<p>World Cup doesn't start until summer, but Mama has already brought home her first World Cup swag. But I don't get it. Why the Denglish? We don't watch much TV, but apparently this is <a href="http://www.cokefridge.de/">Coca-Cola's main advertising slogan</a> in Germany for the tournament. Mama couldn't explain it either, she just shrugged and said "It's supposed to rhyme".</p>
<p>So what slogan are they using in the rest of the world, "It's your Ausw&auml;rtsspiel"?</p>
