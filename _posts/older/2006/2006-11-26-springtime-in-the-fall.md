<p>We've got a heat wave for the end of November. Today was 13°C (mid 50s°F), sunny with a mild breeze. The grass is still green, and the air even smells fresh. It could be springtime, if it weren't for all the leaves on the ground to rake. We <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594392567520/">took a walk</a> this afternoon to appreciate the spring air... Christopher even took his bike (until the mud came). <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594392567520/show/">Slideshow</a></p>
