<p>We took advantage of the sunny afternoon to visit the <a href="http://www.hafengeburtstag.de/Content_en/start_e.htm">Hafengeburtstag</a> in Hamburg yesterday. Christopher was mostly interested in the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/140828086/">carnival rides</a> and the junk food, but I was able to talk him into going aboard the Russian sailing ship <a href="http://www.tallshipmir.ru/">Mir</a>.</p>
