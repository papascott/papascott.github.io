<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/003986.shtml">Heiko for pointing out</a> that <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzkultur/0,1518,435448,00.html">Spiegel Online has relaunched</a> (yet again). My first impression is... I like it. They've made a subtle change in the typography that makes it easier to read. For better or for worse, the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/dienste/0,1518,419923,00.html">SpOn sidebar in Firefox</a> is the first place I look for German news. Maybe Heiko can tell me if <a href="http://focus.msn.de/">Focus</a> has a sidebar as well. Or <a href="http://www.zeit.de/">Die Zeit</a>, <a href="http://couchblog.de/webpropaganda/">Nico</a>?</p>
