<p>When you are a cartoonist you learn to be concise, and in the <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/03/constitutional__1.html">The Dilbert Blog</a> Scott Adams summed my university education in economics and politics in just 3 sentences:</p>
<blockquote><p>I still favor the traditional system where rich people run the country and convince the morons who live here that the voters are really the ones in charge. It's not a perfect system, but no one has come up with a better one. And it's fair in the sense that anyone could become rich and abuse the poor.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't think he's being funny or sarcastic.</p>
