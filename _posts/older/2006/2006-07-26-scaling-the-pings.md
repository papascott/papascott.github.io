<p>Remember those <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/07/19/dont-keep-knocking/">60000 pings per hour</a> I complained about last week? My colleague Lars said he wants them at <a href="http://85.114.159.59/">85.114.159.59</a> for <a href="http://usrportage.de/archives/661-Multithreaded-TCP-server-in-Ruby.html">some Ruby project</a> he's working on and is supposed to be ready "real soon now".</p>
<p>Whatever he's doing, I hope it <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0596102356">scales</a>.</p>
