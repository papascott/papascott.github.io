<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4971164.stm" title="BBC NEWS | Business | Northwest pilots agree wage cuts">BBC NEWS: Northwest pilots agree wage cuts</a>: "Northwest Airlines' pilots have voted to accept a contract that will cut their pay by 24%, a move the firm said is key to it emerging from bankruptcy." Which is good, since we've got non-refundable tickets to fly Northwest to Minnesota in August (although we actually bought the tickets from KLM, which is not bankrupt).</p>
<p>(And is it just British English, or is the BBC cutting back on prepositions in its headlines?)</p>
