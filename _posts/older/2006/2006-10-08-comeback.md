<p>After a <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/07/02/trick-ankle/">devastating injury</a> at her first 10K run in July, MamaMaus today ran 10K at the local <a href="http://www.vfl-jesteburg.de/volkslauf.php">Jesteburger Volkslauf</a>. The weather was cool and pleasant, and the route was mostly on soft trails rather than aspahlt. Her goal was 70 minutes, and she hit it almost exactly (70:30). She got a certificate and an official finish photo.</p>
