<p>We spent the weekend in Stralsund, at the <a href="http://hansedom.de/html/main.jsp" title="Hansedom: Der Hansedom">Hansedom</a>, a spa and wellness park with adjoining hotel. The weekend was a my birthday present from my family, including a fitness test defining in numbers exactly how unfit I am. Christopher enjoyed the water park with 3 slides so much that we went twice. We were very happy with the <a href="http://www.dorintresorts.com/stralsund" title="Verw&ouml;hnhotels - Auswahl - DorintResorts Im HanseDom / Stralsund">hotel</a> (price includes the water park and fitness center), and now that the Autobahn A20 is complete we can reach Stralsund in just 2 hours.</p>
<p>We spent the evening in the old city and harbor, admiring the view of the half-finished and controversial <a href="http://www.r&uuml;gen-br&uuml;cke.de/" title="Die Br&uuml;cke &uuml;ber den Strelasund zwischen der Ferieninsel R&uuml;gen und Stralsund an der Ostsee">R&uuml;genbr&uuml;cke</a>, which we were sure my father, the retired highway engineer, would have very much enjoyed. Before heading home today we crossed over to R&uuml;gen and checked out the resort town of Binz just long enough to buy and ice cream, take a quick walk on the beach, and be able to claim that we've been there.</p>
<p>And the weather was even mostly pleasant, <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/03/25/where-am-i-who-am-i/#comment-2536">unlike what we had been warned</a>. It was a good weekend.</p>
