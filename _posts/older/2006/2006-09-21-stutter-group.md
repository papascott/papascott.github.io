<p>After having had the summer off, Christopher had his first speech therapy session today. A clinic in Hamburg has started a stutter group for children aged 6 to 8 with 2 therapists and 9 children that will meet for 90 minutes every Thursday. The therapy has a large social component, simply bringing them together so they can experience first hand that *other kids stutter too*. That will be a new experience for Christopher, even in the special speech kindergarten he was the only stutterer. The experience is important for us parents as well... *other parents have children who stutter*.</p>
<p>The group seems to have gotten off to a good start. I didn't wait around the whole 90 minutes, but when I came back 15 minutes before the end the room was quite loud. They were having a pillow fight, and after the session Christopher and 4 of the boys were happy to start an extra round. The group is 8 boys and 1 girl... I hope the girl doesn't get scared off. Two or three of the boys are Turkish... that's good, since his school class is rather homogeneous.</p>
<p>Reminder to self: I need to make an appointment with the pediatrician to get a prescription/referral for the group sessions, so that health insurance will cover the costs.</p>
