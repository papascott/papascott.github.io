<p>For our return flight to Germany next week, not only do we have to worry about flight attendants creating <a href="http://www.nwaafa.org/default.asp?id=184" title="CHAOS - Create Havoc Around Our SystemÂ™">CHOAS</a> for Northwest Airlines but now we can no longer <a href="http://www.startribune.com/462/story/606764.html" title="More passenger screening coming to MSP starting Friday">carry liquids</a> in our carry-on luggage. It seems you don't actually have to commit a terrorist act to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4778931.stm">disrupt airline travel</a>, merely talking about it within earshot of a police wiretap seems to be enough. But it could be <a href="http://www.educatedguesswork.org/movabletype/archives/2006/08/threat_modellin_1.html">worse</a> (scroll to first comment)...</p>
