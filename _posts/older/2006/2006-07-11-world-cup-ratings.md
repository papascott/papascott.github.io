<p>About <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/11/sports/soccer/11sandomir.html?ex=1310270400&amp;en=1ad955d799db8bdd&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">16.9 million viewers</a> watched the World Cup final in the US, 2/3 in English on ABC, 1/3 in Spanish on Univision. That's roughly the same number who watch the NCAA men's basketball final or the World Series. That's also <a href="http://worldcup.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=343">roughly the same number</a> of viewers who watched the final in Great Britain.</p>
<p>And for all those folks <a href="http://worldcup.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=274">complaining about the American announcers</a>, you don't know how good you have it. I had to watch 90% of the games in 1986 and 1990 in Spanish. I'm sure I heard the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona">"Diego"</a> uttered at least ten thousand times. And you don't have to listen to <a href="http://www.stopptbeckmann.de/">Reinhold Beckmann</a> either.</p>
