<p>The Olympic TV coverage here is of course very German-centric, so we see mostly the events in which Germans do well, namely races involving skates, sleds, or skis (flat surfaces only, preferably with <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/torino2006/biathlon" title="Turin 2006 Winter Olympics on Yahoo! Sports - Biathlon">guns</a>, especially <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/torino2006/biathlon/news?slug=ap-bia-womens10kmpursuit&prov=ap&type=lgns" title="Wilhelm wins women's sprint in a runaway - Turin 2006 Winter Olympics - Yahoo! Sports">women with guns</a>). We did take the time to watch a very un-German sport, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/winter_sports/4545292.stm" title="BBC SPORT | Other Sport... | Winter Olympics | Event guide: Snowboard cross">snowboard cross</a>. The son of our <a href="http://www.hotelkirchenwirt.at/" title="Landhotel-Kirchenwirt">hotelier</a>, <a href="http://www.hju.at/index1.php" title="Hans Joerg Unterrainer | www.hju.at">Hans Joerg Unterrainer</a>, competed for Austria and finshed a respectable 15th. He won his first heat, but wiped out in the second. Apparently in snowboard cross <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/torino2006/snowboarding/news?slug=ap-sno-jimlitke&prov=ap&type=lgns" title="Flourish to the finish: Too much too soon - Turin 2006 Winter Olympics - Yahoo! Sports">wiping out isn't such a bad thing</a>. Christopher immediately said he wanted to learn to do that... well, I guess there are more dangerous things he could learn. It's just that in northern Germany there are no hills and no snow.</p>
