<p>Jeffrey Zeldman, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2006/09/06/five-years/">Five Years</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ive dug up some things I wrote from New York City and posted here on September 11th 2001 and in the first days following... These mini-essays are not art. They are not reportage, either (but what is?), and may not even be accurate. We were all a bit dazedalthough not so dulled as now. The shock and sorrow were fresh. The events of September 11th had not yet been branded, nor turned into tools of partisan rancor, nor made into a mini-series, nor used to justify atrocity.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess the same applies to <a href="/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/">what I wrote then</a>, from far away. Sometimes I'd just rather <a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/the-go-gos-forget-that-day-lyrics.html">forget that day</a>.</p>
