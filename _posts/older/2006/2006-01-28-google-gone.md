<p>I've removed the Google Adsense ads from PapaScott. Sure everyone seems to <a href="http://www.sourcelabs.com/blogs/ajb/2006/01/googles_doublespeak.html" title="Alex Bosworth's Weblog: Google's DoubleSpeak">do business with China</a> these days, but this is my personal site. They can buy their links someplace else.</p>
