<p>According to <a href="http://teltarif.de/" title="teltarif.de - Kommunikation ganz einfach">teltarif.de</a>, the cheapest rate to call the US is currently <a href="http://www.01026telecom.de/rates.php#U" title="01026 Telecom">1.0 cent per minute</a>. We can't even make local calls that cheaply. Even Skype Out is more expensive.</p>
<p>I forget what we were paying way back when Mama and I were still a-courting, but I have vague memories of 5 DM for 3 minutes or 75 cents per minute from the States.</p>
