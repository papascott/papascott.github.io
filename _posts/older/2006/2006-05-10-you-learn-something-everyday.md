<blockquote>Most Americans, unless they have family or friends who live in or travel to Europe or Canada, have never heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder_Surprise">Kinder Surprise Eggs</a> but when they are finally introduced to them they inevitably ask 'Why don't they sell them in the US?'. The short answer is because the FDA prohibits the sale of something inedible completely incased in something edible.</p></blockquote>
