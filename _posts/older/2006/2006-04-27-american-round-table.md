<p>Our favorite local restaurant California 101 (Neue Strasse 12 in Buchholz) has a American "Stammtisch" the last Thursday of every month for expats, folks who have visited the States, and anyone else who wants to come and speak a little English. </p>
<p>The past few months we've had always been busy on Round Table nights, but this evening we're free and we'll both be there. Mama has to go to Orlando next week, so she can start getting in the mood <strike>for outlet store shopping</strike>.</p>
<p>The food (American and Baja Mexican) and the service are great, there's a toy corner for kids, and we usually eat there 3 or 4 times a month. Christina's too busy to finish her <a href="http://california101.de/">website</a> though.</p>
