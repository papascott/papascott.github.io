<p>Garret P. Vreeland has some <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=10398">heat beating tips</a> from New Mexico that are applicable to the current German heat wave as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wear a hat. </li>
<li>Carry an umbrella. </li>
<li>Use a hand fan. </li>
<li>Little bandana things with gel inside.</li>
<li>Use light moisturizers and sunscreens.</li>
<li>Loose, light-colored clothing. </li>
<li>Open footwear. </li>
<li>Navigate from shade to shade.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can only add that it's as much about attitude as anything else. Germans love to piss and moan, but pissing and moaning won't make you feel any cooler. The attitude that you can do something about it will.</p>
