<p>ChicagoKarl notes the <a href="http://chicagokarl.de/2006/05/german-articles-for-english-words" title="ChicagoKarl &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; German Articles for English Words">prevelence of English jargon</a> in the German language, especially in IT. I think German would be a lot easier without any English words, because</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't which article to use with them</li>
<li>I don't konw how to pronounce them (correct English or phonetic German)</li>
<li>They don't always mean what you think they mean (i.e. <a href="http://dict.leo.org/ende?searchLoc=1&amp;searchLocRelinked=1&amp;lp=ende&amp;search=handy&amp;lp=ende&amp;lang=de&amp;searchLoc=0&amp;searchLocRelinked=1&amp;search=">"handy"</a> doesn't mean adept, and <a href="http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;lang=de&amp;searchLoc=1&amp;cmpType=relaxed&amp;sectHdr=on&amp;spellToler=on&amp;search=pullover&amp;relink=on">"pullover"</a> has nothing to do with the wool over your eyes)</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't worry about it much though. I haven't had any angst of foreign languages since I had a blitz course in French back in kindergarten.</p>
