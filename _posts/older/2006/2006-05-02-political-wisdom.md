<p>More political wisdom from <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2006/05/income_gap.html" title="The Dilbert Blog: Income Gap">Scott Adams</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Personally, I don't vote. That's partly because I know there isn't enough information available for me to make an informed decision, and partly because the rich white guys in power (my peeps) are doing a good job of taking from the poor and giving to me. I don't have much to gripe about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's particularly timely given all the obituaries for <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=us&q=John+Kenneth+Galbraith&btnG=Search+News" title="John Kenneth Galbraith - Google News">John Kenneth Galbraith</a> yesterday.</p>
