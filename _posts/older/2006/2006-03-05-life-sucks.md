<p>Sometimes life sucks, and then it sucks some more.</p>
<p>It isn't enough for my brother, who just turned 40, that he got divorced a couple years ago, lost his job last fall, and has a no-good girlfriend. He went into to the local hospital a Friday night with abdominal pains, which he's had the past 3 weeks but just couldn't stand any longer. </p>
<p>They did a CT scan and determined he probably has a tumor, and he should be checked out by an oncology clinic. It's the weekend, though, so he can't make an appointment until Monday.</p>
<p>Saturday night the pain is so bad he goes in to the ER at 11 PM. And again at 5 AM. The second time they keep him, and as I type this he's on his way to University Hospital in an ambulance with flashing red lights, a 120 mile drive.</p>
<p>The thing is, he's beat cancer (of the <a href="http://www.livestrong.org/">Lance Armstrong variety</a>) once already, 10 years ago. Noone deserves to have to go through that again.</p>
<p>On the bright side, this should scare off the no-good girlfriend for good. Or she'll turn out to be not so no-good after all, which would be even better. </p>
<p>I'm thinking that maybe I should send him a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/medtees/707993">Got Morphine?</a> t-shirt.</p>
