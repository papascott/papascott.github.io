<p>An interesting and long article in the New York Times on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/magazine/23google.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin" title="Google's China Problem (and China's Google Problem) - New York Times">Google's China Problem (and China's Google Problem)</a>, which asks whether some forms of censorship and collaboration and less evil than others, and ends with the proposition that the biggest influence for democracy in China may be "American Idol". </p>
<p>By the way, Google did notice that <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/01/28/google-gone/">I removed my AdSense ads</a>. They sent me an automated email with tips for increasing my revenue. I have the feeling though that boycotting (even a small part of) Google is like boycotting oxygen. You turn blue in the face and everyone else keeps on breathing anyway.</p>
