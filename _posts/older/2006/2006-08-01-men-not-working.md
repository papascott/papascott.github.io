<p>NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/31/business/31men.html?ex=1154577600&amp;en=4c7e6806162a74f1&amp;ei=5087%0A">Men Not Working, and Not Wanting Just Any Job</a>. "Millions of men... between 30 and 55 have dropped out of regular work. They are turning down jobs they think beneath them or are unable to find work for which they are qualified, even as an expanding economy offers opportunities to work", choosing instead to drain savings, take disability, or rely on their wive's income. The result is "a larger share of working-age men are not working today than at almost any point in the last half-century". Is the US catching up with the EU in regards to long-term unemployed?
