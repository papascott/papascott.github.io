<p>Slate, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2152088/entry/2152191/?nav=tap3">"Henry Miller School of Overseas Living for Misanthropes"</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Expat scenes invariably have plenty of writers and artists but a curiously scant quantity of writing and art. This isn't a new phenomenon: Ernest Hemingway alluded to it in The Sun Also Rises, when Bill Gorton jestingly upbraids Jake Barnes: "You drink yourself to death," he says. "You become obsessed with sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafes." George Orwell made a similar observation in "Inside the Whale" (an essay-length riff on Miller's Tropic of Cancer), pointing out that expatriate writers are disproportionately obsessed with "drinking, talking, meditating, and fornicating."

<p>I must be hanging out in the wrong caf√©s. What, no whining? (via <a href="http://www.anglofritz.com/2006/10/refuting_the_suckage.html">anglofritz</a>)</p>
