<p>As the first of December approaches and the first Sunday in Advent, I thought we would share this envelope we received in the mail that pictures the perfect family Christmas... in our worst nightmare! If these children show up at your house, have the parents arrested for child abuse. That girl especially... she's either the <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/capitol-hill/congressional-catfight-harris-vs-pelosi-175045.php">young Nancy Pelosi</a> or the <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/halloween/chilling-cocktobers-house-of-representatives-211355.php">young Laura Bush</a>.</p>
