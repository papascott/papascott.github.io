<p>I never really mentioned it here, but after a long time of reading blogs in <a href="http://www.blogslines.com/">Bloglines</a>, a couple of months ago I tried out <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> and never went back. I've now started <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/15603694783728674282">a link blog</a> using Google Reader's 'shared link' feature (the latest links are in the sidebar here on PapaScott, and there's even a <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/15603694783728674282/state/com.google/broadcast">feed</a>).</p>
<p>At any rate, if there was anything Google didn't know about me before, they certainly know it now. I just have to set up <a href="http://www.google.com/a/">Google Aps for My Domain</a> and their control over me is complete.</p>
