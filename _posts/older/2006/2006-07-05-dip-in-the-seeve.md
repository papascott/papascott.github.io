<p><!-- ckey="5C548C12" -->We have temperatures well over 32°C (90°F), so yesterday afternoon Christopher cooled off in the Seeve, the creek that runs near our house. It used to be a popular starting point for canoes, but the banks have eroded and the county has now banned all boats. They're currently building up the bank, so Christopher had to nearly crawl over a backhoe to get in the water</p>
<p>There's a slideshow <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594187886703/show/">here</a> for grandparents and other Christopher fans.</p>
