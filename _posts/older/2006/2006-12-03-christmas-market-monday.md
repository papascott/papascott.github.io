<p>J decided that <a href="http://www.jbittner.com/germany/2006/12/4-december-2006-is-christmas-market.html">tomorrow would be Christmas Market Monday</a>, when we all post pictures from our visits to our local Christmas Markets this past weekend. I usually don't go along with special blogging days, but since we were meeting Oma at the Christmas Market in Buchholz anyway, I brought my camera along. Just to be a non-conformist, I'm posting mine a day early. There's a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/detail7">set at flickr</a>, and a slideshow <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/show/">here</a>. I tried to tell a story with the captions, so maybe the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/detail/">plain view</a> is better than the slideshow (where you have to click on each picture to see the caption).</p>

<p>It would have been funnier to go to the <a href="http://www.hamburg.de/event.do?cid=6513353">"Santa Pauli" Christmas Market</a> on Spielbudenplatz, which features booths from FC St. Pauli and a various sex shops, since we were in the area on Friday. Actually not, since it was so blatantly commercial and was most definately inappropriate for children. We didn't stop.</p>
