<p>Another pitfall of telecommuting is that they start an internal blog at the office and you don't find out about it until 6 weeks later (no, it's not <a href="http://www.technorat.de/">Technorat</a>). They've been posting profiles of various co-workers, and since I doubt that <a href="http://poolie.kulando.de/">Poolie</a> will come to Hamburg to interview me, I've decided to save him the trouble.</p>
