<p>We once again celebrated the Nikolaus holiday <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/05/american-nikolaus/">in American fashion</a>, with a Christmas stocking instead of a shoe. As Christopher was enjoying his present before getting ready for school, he suddenly asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Mama, were you the Nikolaus?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, he's old enough now for a straight answer.</p>
