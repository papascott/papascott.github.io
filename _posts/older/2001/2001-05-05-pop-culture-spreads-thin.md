<p>An awful lot of webloggers have admitted to watching 'Survivor'. Could one of you please explain to <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2001/05/03">Andrea</a> what it is? She says that without a TV of her own, she hasn't been able to keep up with how low the niveau of modern television has fallen. (Then again, maybe she doesn't really want to know.)</p>
