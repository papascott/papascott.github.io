<p>Yes, Grandma and Grandpa, we haven't been very good about posting pictures the past couple of weeks. We've caught up now. At PhotoPoint we've filled up <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&a=12820285&f=0">May</a> and took pictures today at an historic mill and of Christopher playing in the rain for <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&a=13155765&f=0">June</a>. And just yesterday I figured out how to make a Video CD, and we'll be sending you one tomorrow.</p>

<p>Following <a href="http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2001/06/03.html">JÃ¶rg`s</a> tip that today was <a href="http://www.muehlen-dgm-ev.de/teilnehmer/start.htm">German Mill Day</a>, we biked down to the mill at Holm, about a 15 minute trip. It was our first bike trip with Christopher. </p>

<p>The camera is on a slow flash setting, so the moving gears are blurred. Our batteries ran out before I could get a picture outside.</p>

<p>In the afternoon it rained again. Christopher likes pushing things, and we finally got him something of his own to push, a doll buggy. That poor bear has to go a lot to keep up with Christopher.</p>

<p>In the evening we went out to our old favorite restaurant, the <a href="http://www.treibhaus-marxen.de">Treibhaus</a>. Christopher was rowdy and rambunctious, just as you'd expect after an 3-day weekend of rain. Good thing that the Treibhaus staff knows us and likes us.</p>
