<p>Christopher <a href="http://shcon.com/index.php?album=07_2001%2F20010726&dispsize=512&start=0">cools off</a> after a long hot day in the sandbox. (<br />
<a href="http://phpix2.sourceforge.net/">PHPix</a> seems to be working quite well for the pictures, even though it's running on a very underpowered box. I think we'll keep it!)</p>
<p>Posted in our company intranet: <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sz/kultur/bundesdance/start.html">Bundesdance</a> (Flash alert!) with Schr√∂der, Merkel and Stoiber. You can pick their music and dance moves. Knowledge of German language and politics helpful but not required. </p>
<p>My look at OSX was fun. I didn't notice any signs of sluggishness, but I guess 256MB RAM at 733 MHz is enough to handle it. Alas, all we wanted the Mac for was Netscape 4.7x under OS9 to test a Java HBCI banking application. All we would have needed is an iMac for half the price.</p>
<p>BTW, running <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/">kill 1</a> as root in the OSX terminal brings the GUI to a halt and throws you into a full screen text window. We thought that was cool!</p>
