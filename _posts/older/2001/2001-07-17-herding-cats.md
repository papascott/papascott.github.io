<p>Speaking of fairs, my hometown <a href="http://www.mfcf.com/lacquiparle_county_fair.html">county fair</a> is held very late, in September after the state fair. My mother is organizing the church food stand, and is trying to fill all the (volunteer) shifts for the four days. She says that it's more difficult than the nursing schedules she used to prepare. I'm sure she'll accept volunteers from outside the congregation, if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>A German 'Jahrmarkt' is similar to the midway of a state or county fair, but without the agricultural show. There is, however, an agricultural trade fair held concurrently some yeary with the biggest Jahrmarkt of them all, the <a href="http://www.oktoberfest.de">Oktoberfest</a> in Munich. When we took my brother to Oktoberfest a few years ago, a Bavarian farmer in town for the ag fair tried to teach him how to do bird calls.</p>
