<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com">Andrea</a>, next time you <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2001/01/30">come to Lüllau for a visit</a>, you don't have to stand outside barefoot in the cold. Come on in! </p>
<p>Wörme, where Andrea's cousin lives, is literally within walking distance from us (at leasfor Germans, I don't think most Americans would walk that far). Wörme has a 50-year old <a href="http://www.bgn-demeter.de/hof_woerme_uk.html">organic farm</a>, an antique small-gauge train (<a href="http://www.wilde-erika.de/"><i>Die Wilde Erika</i></a>) with 1 km of track, a nice patch of <i>Heide</i> (heather) called the Busenbachtal, and a kiosk that caused a lawsuit because it is technically in a residential area. All this in village smaller than Lüllau!</p>
<p>Christopher seems to have caught a cold, which explains why he was in a bad mood yesterday. He's wheezing and coughing, has little appetite, but no fever. I was able to pick him up early this afternoon, and he'll spend a quiet day at home tomorrow with Mama. He's actually pretty happy at the moment, as long as he can hold a telephone of some sort.</p>
