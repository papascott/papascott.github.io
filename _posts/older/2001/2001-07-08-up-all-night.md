<p>Last night we went to a <a href="http://jwsell.wooster.edu/skat/Skatdflt.html">Skat</a> (a German card game that defies concise description) party that is hosted by an ex-coworker of my brother-in-lay every year. It's fun in that everyone takes the game pseudo-seriously... but that's not the point. We took Christopher along, thinking he would go to sleep after the first round and that we would not be distracted the rest of the evening. Nothing doing. He stayed awake until midnight, for all 3 rounds, and was in a surprisingly good mood that late, all things considered, but our scores suffered accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/07/07">Sheila</a> yesterday had several links about women's baseball. Meanwhile, on this continent, in soccer <a href="http://uk.sports.yahoo.com/010707/80/bxmpf.html">Germany win women's European Championship again</a>. The final was nationally televised, and the tournament as a whole sold 90,000 tickets and turned a small profit</p>
