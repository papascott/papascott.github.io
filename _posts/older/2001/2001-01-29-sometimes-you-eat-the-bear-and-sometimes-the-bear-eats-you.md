<p>Today, my home office day, the bear ate me. Or maybe I'm just tired from the weekend, since both days Mama I worked and I was in charge of the boy.</p>
<p>Christopher has learned several new tricks. One is to pull his bib up over his head during mealtimes. If I pull the bib back down and say 'No,' he cries and won't eat. If I leave the bib over his head, his face is covered and he can't eat, although eventually he'll pull the bib completely off and start again with his shirt, which of course has sleeves and cannot be pulled over his head, so he cries and won't eat. Toddler logic.</p>
<p>It is also disconcerting that he takes possession of any object he can reach, especially anything that resembles a telephone. Remote controls are OK, and a cordless or, even better, a cell phone is especially good. (Cell phones for toddlers could be a real money maker for the cell phone providers, since toddlers dial at random and never hang up.)</p>
<p>By the way, a Macintosh mouse, even though it has a cord, is a good substitute for a cordless phone, since itnot only fits in the hand like a telephone, but with the ball underneath can also be pushed across the floor like a car. And, yes, you can probably discern my current opinion of the Macintosh by the fact that I let Christopher play with my Mac mouse and not my PC mouse. </p>
<p>PS: Mama snuck a peak at an E-Mail to her boss, and now figures her chances are up from 98% to 99%. If not 99.9%.</p>
