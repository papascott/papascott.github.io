<p>PapaScott has decided to take a nap. There's too much to do at work and at home, and in less than 2 weeks we fly to the States for Christmas in Minnesota. Maybe I'll post again from Minnesota, maybe not until we return on New Year's Eve, just in time for the Euro Exchange to begin. Until then, good night, sleep tight, and don't let the bedbugs bite!</p>
<p><i>P.S. I'll still be reading!</i></p>
