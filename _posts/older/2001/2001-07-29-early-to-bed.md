<p>Very nice weather this weekend, the whole past week, in fact. Nearly 30&deg;C, sunny, slight breeze. Unusual for northern Germany. We should really be outside.</p>
<p>While looking for something else at <a href="http://freshmeat.net">FreshMeat</a>, I bumped into <a href="http://billstclair.com/blogmax">BlogMax</a>, "an Emacs package that aids in the creation of a weblog". It creates a Manila-like static site, and is by Bill St. Clair of <a href="http://billstclair.com/blog">End the War on Freedom</a>. It looks interesting, but doesn't seem to work with XEmacs.</p>
<p>Flipping the page with <a href="http://www.konqueror.org">Konqueror</a> (2.2beta1) now works!</p>
