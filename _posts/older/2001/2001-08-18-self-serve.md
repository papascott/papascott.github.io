<p>Christopher decided to serve his own breakfast this morning. Brötchen with strawberry jelly, but please hold the Brötchen. More pictures from yesterday and today are <a href="http://www.shcon.com/index.php?album=08_2001%2F20010818&dispsize=512&start=0">here</a>. (The Pictures link above has been updated to point to the new pictures site.)</p>
<p>Next week Mama travels to Verona for a meeting with the exective board and a visit to the <a href="http://194.149.233.39/English/">opera</a> on Friday night. (Spouses were also invited, but we felt that Christopher is too young yet to leave with a babysitter for 4 days, so the men are staying home.) But on Saturday afternoon, her brother and his wife are celebrating their 10th anniversary with a <a href="http://www.ms-stadt-kiel.de/">chartered cruise</a> in the Kiel Bay. And looking at the flight plans, there is no way to get from Verona to Kiel in time for the cruise. Not unless she charters a helicopter. I don't suppose <a href="http://www.curry.com/">Adam Curry</a> will loan us his.</p>
<p>Travel plans: We'll be in Minnesota for 3 weeks in December to celebrate Christmas and Christopher's second birthday, returning before New Year's. Next spring, Mama has a meeting in Las Vegas the last week of April. Christopher and I will tag along, and the authorities in Vegas have been <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$901">warned</a>. We'll probably also swing through the West Coast, so that Mama won't be able to complain anymore that I've never taken her to San Francisco.</p>
