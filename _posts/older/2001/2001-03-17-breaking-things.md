<p><b>Noon</b><br />
Christopher has a fat lip. He slipped from the couch and landed with his lip on the corner of Mama's old doll house. There was some blood at first as two teeth cut into his lip, but he's eating and drinking just fine. He just looks like a battered boxer.</p>

<p><b>Early</b><br />
Something is very wrong with my internal body clock I used to to think that 5 am was a time of day that existed only in limbo. Now, even though I can sleep until 5:45 on work days, I'm always awake before 5:00. Even on weekends, when I can sleep in.</p>
