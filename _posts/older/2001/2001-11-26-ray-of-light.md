<p>Not all dot.coms are bombing. My employer just posted a 3rd quarter profit of 2000 Euros. Good thing no one raided the petty cash, we could have ended up with a loss! ";->" On the other hand, one of our main competitors just declared itself insolvent.</p>
<p>Dave has written a press release proclaiming that <a href="http://www.userland.com/stories/storyReader$136">SOAP 1.1 and<br />
XML-RPC work with 802.11b</a>. What I'd really like to know is whether<br />
they work with another wireless protocol, namely <a href="http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/">CPIP as per RFC 1149</a> <i>CPIP = Carrier Pigeon Internet Protocol</i> ";->"</p>
