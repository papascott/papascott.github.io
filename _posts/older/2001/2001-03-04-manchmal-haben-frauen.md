<p>Today's an off day as the team has a chance to recuperate and prepare for the tough week ahead.</p>
<p>Yesterday Christopher and I spent our day upgrading PCs. I picked up a 900 MHz Athlon for myself, Mama gets my old 500 MHz Athlon and more RAM, and a CD writer. She's become interested in music from Napster lately, and her company car has a CD player. So now she can burn her own music CDs.</p>
