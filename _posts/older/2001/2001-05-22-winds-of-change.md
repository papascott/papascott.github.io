<p>Christopher has a new hobby. He throws things down the stairs from the upper floor and laughs hysterically. Since our staircase is open, with luck he can reach the basement and break whatever he is throwing. He just tried it with my mobile phone.</p>
<p>He also tried eating dandilions for desert this evening. Should I be worried?</p>
