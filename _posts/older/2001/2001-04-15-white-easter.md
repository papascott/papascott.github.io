<p><b>Late</b><br />
Luckily, it didn't stay cold the whole day. We went to visit Christopher's grandmother in Eckernf√∂rde, and while the weather wasn't particularly pleasant, it wasn't cold. Christopher was in a better mood than he looks like in the pictureand yes, he has a new haircut.</p>
<p><b>Early</b><br />
Did I mention that it's cold here? It's snowing on Easter morning!</p>
