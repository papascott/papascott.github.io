<p>Christopher could get a new cousin today, as his uncle Roland brought aunt Kirsten to the hospital last night. Today is both Kirsten's and Roland's birthday. Three birthdays on the same day in the same family? <b>Update:</b> It's a girl... Lily is her name! 5200 g, 56 cm long, born at 2:30 pm. Now Christopher is no longer the baby of the family.</p>
