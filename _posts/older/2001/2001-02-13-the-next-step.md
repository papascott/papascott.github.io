<p>For those keeping score of Christopher's accomplishments, he's now able to crawl up a complete flight of stairs. I'm not sure if he can crawl all the way down yet; he did manage half a staircase crawling backwards. This is all, of course, under close adult supervision. </p>
<p>I'm under the weather with a cold and sore throat, and rather than fight it I got a yellow slip from the doctor to stay home from work until Thursday. Mama is out-of-town until late tomorrow, though, and the yellow slip doesn't excuse me from Christopher duty mornings and evenings.</p>
<p>Nobody at work wants to administer the FreeBSD machines. We have mostly Linux and Solaris, with just a few special purpose machines running FreeBSD. One of those machines, though, is my webserver, and to make a long story short, I ended up volunteering to become the FreeBSD specialist.</p>
