<p>Hi, we're back on European turf. We got to experience first hand the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/12/30#lb80afadc2c02a67a0b715b010c14523f">confusion</a> at airports that Dave mentioned. Actually, except for my shoes going through the sprectrometer (without me in them), getting through security was no big deal. </p>
<p>Gotta run, the German New Year's Eve tradition <a href="http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa010101a.htm">Dinner for One</a> is about to come on TV...</p>
