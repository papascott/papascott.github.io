<p>Mama's back from Verona, and we're all three back from the boat party in Kiel. Mama's going to demonstrate her newly learned pasta-rolling skills tonight.</p>
<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2001/09/01">Andrea</a> points to National Geographic's <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/traveler/index50.html">50 Places of a Lifetime</a>. The list looks like enough for a dozen lifetimes to me. Funny things is, in a bi-national family we have <i>less</i> opportunity to see places than we would otherwise, since our resources we have for travelling (mainly time, but also money) are spent visiting family and relatives. My parents have seen more of Europe than I have, and Mama's brothers have seen more of the US than Mama has. So it goes. But at least I have one place on both <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com">Andrea</a> and <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/">Susan</a>, namely <a href="http://www.ipanema.com/">Rio de Janeiro</a>. And Mama has been to <a href="http://www.istanbulcityguide.com/">Istanbul</a>.</p>
