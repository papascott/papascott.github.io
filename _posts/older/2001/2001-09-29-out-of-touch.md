<p>We were offline for a day and a half due to a ISDN outage. Did anyone miss us?</p>
<p>More annoying than the Internet outage was the phone outage, since Mama and Christopher were away helping Oma Ruth move, and we needed to keep in touch to I could help unload the truck on this end. </p>
<p>It was not particularly comforting this morning when reporting the outage to Deutsche Telekom to be connected to a call center in Bavaria. Gru√ü Gott! Ack, just last week I submitted the application to switch away from the big pink T to an alternative local telecom provider. The main reason being that T-Online no longer offers an ISDN flatrate, and cannot provide us with DSL.</p>
