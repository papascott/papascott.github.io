<p>Best wishes to Roland and Kirsten, Mama's brother and sister-in-law, who announced to the family today that they are expecting a 3rd child in November. </p>
<p>In the spirit of stressed-out parents, I've uploaded a new layout that's only half finished. I've stolen the Tagesm√ºtter logo; it seems to fit us somehow. I still need to work out where to put the calendar and the favorite links. Putting text over the colored stripes is not a good option</p>
<p>Christopher's word of the day is 'deng'. This apparently is an exclamation to be made when any object, including Christopher himself, falls to the floor with a thud. Deng.</p>
