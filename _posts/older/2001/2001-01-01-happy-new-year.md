<p>Happy New Year from the three of us here in LÃ¼llau!</p>
<p>Mama's 1 year (actually 14 months) of maternity leave is now officially over. Today is a holiday; she starts work tomorrow. Task 1: getting to the office without a car, so she can drive her company car home.</p>
<p>Actually, Task 0 (tomorrow and 3 days a week from now on): get Christopher to day care on time. And for PapaScott: get to work by 7:30, so that he can pick up Christopher from day care on time.</p>
