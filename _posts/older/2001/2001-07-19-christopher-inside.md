<p>Some days you never know what you'll find in the kitchen cupboards.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de"><img src="https://www.spiegel.de/img/0,1020,119329,00.jpg" align="left" border="0" /></a>This week's <a href="http://www.spiegel.de">Spiegel</a> has a cover story on 'The new mother's pride: children instead of career' that Mama found amusing. In western Germany just 5% of the mothers with pre-kindergarten children work full time, and just 16% of mothers of children in elementary school. And how many mothers are responsible for tens of millions of monthly revenue and several thousand employees? I personally found the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,145177,00.html">story</a> about <a href="http://www.msco.org">Sherrif Joe</a> from Phoenix and his tent jails and chain gangs entertaining. I don't think I'd eat his green bologna, though.</p>
