<p><b>Late</b><br />
I slept 3 hours this afternoon. I had to pick up Christopher after all, and nearly overslept. We need to think of a late-afternoon nutrition plan for him. He comes home from day care hungry (yes, they do feed him!), but a whole banana and an entire yoghurt at 5:30pm tend to ruin his supper.</p>
<p>
<b>Early</b><br />
This morning my sore throat is gone and my eyes are less pink. I'm staying home anyway. I don't even have to worry about picking up Christopher. After 3 days of late meetings, Mama's going to take a short day today.</p>
