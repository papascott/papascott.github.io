<p>This evening I finished up the content for the <a href="http://shanson.bei.t-online.de">day-care website</a> I'm putting together for Christopher's "Tagesutter". Instead of 4 or 5 pages it ended up being 9 pages. Those day-care people are doing a lot more than I thought. </p>
<p>In trying lasso loose domains and set up an SSL PKI account, my desk at work is awash with paperwork. I have to track down legal paperwork for UK corporations, wire transfers of US dollars to South Africa, and get my boss to vouch to Thawte that I am really me and that I really work for him. </p>
<p>George W probably thinks he's smart to show up at the EU summit in Sweden on Thursday. If he were really smart, he would have crashed the French-German pre-summit in Freiburg today, where Schr√∂der, Chirac and Jospin decided in advance what will be decided at the EU summit. (By the way, Mama is miffed that George W isn't visiting  Berlin on his first visit to Europe. Then again, Mama is miffed by just about everything that George W does or doesn't do.)</p>
