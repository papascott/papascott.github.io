<p>Mama's flying to Munich and back today. We'll see if she runs into any new security procedures. <b>Later:</b> She didn't report anything unusual, except that on the place she sat next to a nice American man with a German wife and a 6-month-old son named Christopher Paul.</p>
<p>CNN: <a href="http://europe.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/18/inv.hamburg.suspects/index.html">Hamburg cell reveals details</a>. Looking at the pictures and the name that one of the hijackers used while in Hamburg, we realize that it's possible we might have had (slight) contact with him a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Server change! Not for this website, but for our personal domains, <a href="http://photos.shcon.com">photos</a> and mail. My old hoster is going out of business. If I may pat myself on the back, the main domain is already done and took less than an hour. The trick was that I had the DNS at <a href="http://www.easydns.com">EasyDNS</a>. Once I knew the new IP address, I just changed it on their web interface and it was active within 15 minutes. So no horror story of being unreachable for days!</p>
<p>FWIW, my domains are now at <a href="http://www.pair.com">Pair</a>, where I've done business before. FreeBSD, SSH access, and they got the site going within a couple hours of my online application.</p>
