<p>Christopher turns two today (or zwei, depending on which language he happens to be using). His grandmother has a big turkey in the oven for him. Actually, he calls all birds ducks, so he thinks it's a duck. (And if you think that life with Christopher is something like a <a href="http://www.whyaduck.com/">Marx Brothers</a> movie, you're probably right.)</p>
