<p>While Mama hat the honor of going back to her office yesterday for her weekly Monday Madness, for Christopher and me today was the first day back. Mama's boss is in town, they're out of town tonight, so I have double duty. Of course, CRH (that's Christopher Ryan Hanson) had to be woken up at 7:00, and I'm guessing he had a very "loud" nap at day care, since he got tired real fast this evening. He didn't want me to leave this morning, and was very happy to see me this afternoon, but Heide assured me that he was fine all day.</p>
<p>We're starting to recognize a few words among his babbling. He says "all done" when he's done eating and has pushed away his plate, and her called his Oma Ruth "Um-ma" last week. </p>
<p>https://www.papascott.de isn't completely configured yet, but I'm already starting to post things there that aren't really family related. I'm going to try to post at least one German news story per day that I find interesting. I've already mentioned the upcoming NATO mission to Macedonia and the discussion on workfare.</p>
