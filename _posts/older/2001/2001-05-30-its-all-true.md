<p><b>Last Flight Home</b></p>

<p>Thanks to an overly long meeting in Munich, Mama missed the last flight back to Hamburg. She has to fly to Hannover and rent a car, and she could only say good night to Christopher on the phone.</p>
<p><b>Culinary highlights of Amsterdam</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Like <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/05/26">Dave</a>, we had to have herring Broodjes. They were good, and Christopher enjoyed his share, but we didn't think they much different from north German Fischbrotchen.
</li>
<li>On Sunday we three shared a large order of Poffertjes (mini pancakes) with strawberries and cream for lunch. We sat outside at a colorful stand.

</li>
<li>And, of course, the beer. Thankfully, the north German '7 minute Pils' never caught on in Holland, and your Heineken (short but fresh) is brought to you within seconds after it's ordered.
</li>
</ul>
