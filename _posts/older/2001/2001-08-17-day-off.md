<p>Mama and Christopher are off to Oma Ruth's today, to give her some help for her move at the end of September. She'll then be in Buchholz,  5 minutes away instead of 90 minutes. Anyway, on my last vacation day I'm bach'ing it. (That's 'Strohwitwe' for the German audience.)</p>
<p>The test site <a href="https://www.papascott.de">papascott.de</a> got <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/01/20010816">dang-meta'ed</a>. I've started putting up some real content so that the folks don't get too bored.</p>
