<p><a href="http://static.userland.com/sh4/gems/mausnews/bath.rm">In the bath</a>: a pitiful first attempt at uploading home video for the web (30 seconds for Real Player, 163 KB). It's going to take a while for me to learn digital video. Maybe I need a 'Dummies' book. <b>Later:</b> It worked! Christopher's grandparents were able to view the video.</p>
<p><b>Helping out family in Minnesota</b></p>
<p>My mother writes (I've removed the names): "Dad has been very busy this past week.  His sister-in-law's brother had a heart attack about a month ago so was unable to plant his crops.  He has about a 1000 acres.  Dad, two of his brothers along with a couple of neighbors and a son got going on Wed. and Thurs. and it sounded like they would finish up Friday. I think they meant all of it.  Then after a few weeks, the neighbor will spray for weeds and then they are set till harvest."</p>
<p><b>And finally in soccer</b></p>
<p>Hamburg's inner-city team <a href="http://www.fcstpauli.de">FC St. Pauli</a> has promoted to the Bundesliga 1st league for the 4th in 12 years (which means they've been demoted to the 2nd league 3 times in that same time period).  I imagine that in a year or two they'll be back in the 2nd league, but it will be fun to have them in the big league for a while, if nothing else than to watch overpaid teams like Bayern Munich play in their dinky neighborhood stadium.</p>
