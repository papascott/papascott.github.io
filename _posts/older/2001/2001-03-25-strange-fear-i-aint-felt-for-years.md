<p>Europe went on Daylight Savings Time today, in case you're wondering what we're doing up so early. North America starts next weekend, right?</p>
<p>It's still awfully cold, though. Mid-30's and freezing rain. Yech!</p>
<p>Considering I was half sick yesterday, I got a lot done. (Mama was full sick,so she couldn't help.) I fixed the lock on our mailbox (after 6 months), so we again comply with German postal secrecy and require at least a good screwdriver to break in (which is how we broke the original lock). And I hung a curtain in Christopher's bedroom in preparation for longer daylight. After all, the longer he sleeps, the longer we sleep.</p>
