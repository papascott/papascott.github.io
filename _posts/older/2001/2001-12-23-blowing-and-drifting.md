<p><a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/2001/12/22">Hal</a> mentions a boyhood encounter with lutefisk. I thought Swedes had more sense than to eat lutefisk, but whatever.</p>
<p>My hometown of Madison MN is <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/roger/QueryTips.php3?tip.AttractionName=Lutefisk&tip.Town=Madison">Lutefisk Capital USA</a>, but I still don't eat the stuff.</p>
