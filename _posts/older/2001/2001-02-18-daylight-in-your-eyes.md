<p>Update: I finally linked to the <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$501">code</a>. For now my favorites box is just alphabetical.</p>
<p>For a long time I've been intending to update the favorites box. I'm too lazy to update it by hand, so I wanted it to automatically copy (via XML) the favorites I choose on Weblogs.Com. Actually, I was so lazy that I was waiting for someone else to figure how to do this. But since noone has bothered to solve my problem yet, <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$501">I took some time yesterday to start writing some perl</a>. The hard part is done, hopefully today I'll be able to add the finished result to this page.</p>
