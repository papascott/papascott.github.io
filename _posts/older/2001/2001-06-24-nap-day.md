<p><b>Update:</b> The sun came out this afternoon after all. Thanks, <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2001/06/24">Andrea</a>! But Christopher, the sand belongs <i>in</i> the sandbox!</p>
<p>The promised summer sun for today has not arrived. MamaMaus and Christopher are celebrating the fall-like weather by both taking a mid-day nap.</p>
