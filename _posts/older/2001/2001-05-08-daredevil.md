<p>After a successful re-entry to day care and a hard afternoon on the lawn and in the sand box, by 8 pm Christopher was filthy. Mama filled his bathtub (which sits inside our bathtub), turned around for a second, and Christopher jumped in by himself, clothes and all. Of course he could have hurt himself quite seriously, but as it was he just got wet.</p>
