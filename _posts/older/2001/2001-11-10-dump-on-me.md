<p>In T-minus 12 days or so, we're dumping the Deutsche Telekom for the local provider EWETel for all of our telecommunication needs. To do so, we're required to replace the NTBA on our ISDN line. The new one looks almost like the old one, so I thought I could just switch the wires for the line going upstairs. Except that the wires are in a different order, and I managed to confuse one pair. Good thing there are only a finite number of permutations to order 4 objects. </p>
<p>AP: <a href="http://news.excite.com/news/ap/011110/11/obit-kesey">Novelist, 60s Icon Ken Kesey Dies</a>. He was one author who helped me make some sense out of this crazy world. No, that's not quite right... he helped me accept the fact that the world is crazy, and to not waste my time trying to make sense of it.</p>
