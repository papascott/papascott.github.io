<p>It could have been a nice pleasant Indian Summer Sunday, but after Christopher decided that 5:30 was a fine time to wake up, and spending 3 hours hanging a single curtain rod for Mama's mother, the day was pretty much shot.</p>
<p>Two comments from German newscasts this evening seem to have some truth. ZDF: As the Americans have no concrete plans for what happens after the Taleban, the attacks on Afghanistan are nothing but shots in in the air. ARD (on the anthrax scare): Fear is the main weapon of terrorists. Right now in the United States, that weapon is being used very effectively.</p>
<p>And, almost as a footnote, the ARD newscast reported <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20011014/wl/croatia_dialysis_deaths_5.html">23 dialysis deaths in Croatia</a>, which, if I were a dialysis patient, would scare me a lot more than white powder in an envelope.</p>
