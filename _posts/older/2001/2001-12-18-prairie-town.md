<p>After a week in the Twin Cities, and no time to go online, we're now in rural Minnesota, with Christopher's grandparents. There's a little snow on the ground, but it's much too warm for Minnesota in December. The flight over was uneventful. Christopher bounced in his seat for the first 4 hours from Amsterdam to Minneapolis, slept for a couple of hours, then bounced the rest of the flight. His parents didn't sleep at all.</p>
