<p>I've been installing another round of child-safety devices in the kitchen today. In addition to the usual <a href="http://www.helly.de/produkte/kueche/sicherheitsriegel.htm">cupboard latches</a> we found a clever <a href="http://www.helly.de/produkte/kueche/herdschutz.htm">shield for the stove</a> which covers the knobs when it's folded down.</p>
