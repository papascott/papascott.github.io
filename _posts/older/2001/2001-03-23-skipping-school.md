<p>We're home, but not well. Mama and I both have the flu, she quite a bit worse than I, leaving Crhistopher to be healthy, active, and wondering who will be taking care of him. </p>
<p>It might have something to do with the Minnesota March weather we've been having. Yech!</p>
<p>Christopher's lip is nearly back to normal. Two small white slits are all that can be seen.</p>
