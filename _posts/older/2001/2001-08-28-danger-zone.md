<p>Christopher is making good progress on turning the world into a more dangerous place. He can now open all of our doors, including the front door (we have German style door handles; American style round door knobs would be somewhat safer). And he has figured out that electrical cords are to be inserted into electrical sockets, and has made it his personal mission to plug them all in.</p>
