<p>Today was an extra day home with Christopher.  I was able to get some work done, mostly because I was up at 5 and Christopher slept in until 10:30.</p>
<p>Today was also Mama's meeting with her new Ãœberboss, the meeting she has been preparing for the past three weeks. She thought that he would have doubts about putting a young mother in a position of responsibility, but the meeting went well. And all the signals she is receiving this week are positive. And, most importantly, she wants the responsibility and is confident that she can handle it.</p>
<p>As for me, I placed my trust in her ability when we came to Germany 10 years ago. I knew she would be successful, and I was right, and I got to tag along. (It's not like I'm extra baggage, though; in that time I've learned German and established a career.) Now, of course, we two have become we three, and the stakes are now higher. But I know she will be successful, and this time Christopher and I get to tag along together. </p>
<p>Anyway, we'll see what happens in about 6 weeks. In the meantime, we can finally start our normal routine next week, so that we each spend a weekday home with Christopher, instead of just me.</p>
