<p>Two years ago, I was delighted to discover that "it worked!". And it still does. Thanks, "UserLand".</p>
<p>(But it doesn't always work as expected. The It Worked! link above, which I entered in Manila fashion in double quotes, goes to an <a href="http://mausnews.editthispage.com/">old name and design</a> for PapaScott. ";->")</p>
