<p>John thinks this picture shows that we <a href="http://iowa.weblogger.com/2001/11/17">let Christopher play with dynamite</a>. While that does look like an explosion behind him to the right, Christopher is actually destructive enough without the help of explosives.</p>

<p>Thanks, <a href="http://blackholebrain.editthispage.com/"> Mike</a>, for noticing that I forgot to include captions for the pictures this morning and <a href="http://blackholebrain.editthispage.com/2001/11/16">supplying your own</a>. At least I should be thankful that I'm not the subject of <a href="http://blackholebrain.editthispage.com/2001/11/17">the latest caption contest</a>. Although that mullah looks like he just opened Christopher's diaper pail.</p>
