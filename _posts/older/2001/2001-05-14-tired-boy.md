<p>I don't know how we managed it, but we wore Christopher completely out yesterday. He fell asleep on the living room floor before we could take him to bed. Too much sandbox, swing set, and Bobby Car!</p>
<p>We try to avoid 'potty talk' here at PapaScott, but now for the second day in a row, Christopher has come to me when his diaper was full, more or less asking to be changed. Maybe he's implying that I sometimes forget to check.</p>
