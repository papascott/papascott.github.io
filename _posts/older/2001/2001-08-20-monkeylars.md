<p>My grandfather used to call us kids "Monkeylars" when we were causing too much trouble or making too much noise. For the same reason I've taken to calling Christopher Monkeylars. A search on Google reveals that the word <a hrehttp://www.google.com/search?q=monkeylars>Monkeylars does not exist yet on the web. Well, it does now.</p>
