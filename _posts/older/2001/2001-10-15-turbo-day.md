<p>Mama's getting her new <a href="http://www.bmw.com/bmwe/products/automobiles/5er/sedan/index.html">company car</a> (530i) today, 6 months after her promotion, and in the wrong color. I'm only slightly jealous. Then again, without me, she'll never be able to program the CD changer or the navigation system. To bring some speed into my own life, I bought 256 MB RAM (up from 64 MB) for my ThinkPad.</p>
