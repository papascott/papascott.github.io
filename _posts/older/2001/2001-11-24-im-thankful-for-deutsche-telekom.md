<p>Christopher talking to his grandparents in Minnesota. More recent action pics <a href="http://photos.shcon.com/index.php?album=11_2001%2F20011124&dispsize=512&start=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>We've now extracted ourselves from the fiendish clutches of <a href="http://www.telekom.de">Deutsche Telekom</a>. Our entire telephone connection is now with <a href="http://www.ewetel.net">EWE Tel</a>, and we can once again surf (and not to mention work) on the Internet without looking over our shoulder at the meter. It's only ISDN. Maybe someday we'll get broadband here. Maybe not. </p>
<p>After <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/11/23">seeing on Scripting News</a> that seven-year-old <a href="http://scobleizer.ManilaSites.Com/2001/09/01">Patrick Scoble</a> has a weblog, I added it to my favorites. Now, as you see, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001099/">his weblog</a> is gone. Ironic that a Userland product suffers from linkrot.</p>
