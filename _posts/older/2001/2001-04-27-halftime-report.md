Not just "two steps to get from chair to chair because it's too much trouble to get down and crawl", this is "get up by myself and take six steps just because I feel like it". And Grandma and Grandpa were here to see it. The world has just become a tiny bit more unsafe.</p>

<p>No pictures, because we've been playing with a new Canon MV300i video camera. I've knocked myself out trying to load video into the PC. I think the Firewire card is bad.</p>
