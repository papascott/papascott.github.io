<p>One of the disadvantages of an electric lawn mower is that you have to pay close attention to the power cord. Yesterday Mama didn't pay attention, and mowed right over the cord. Luckily the circuit breaker did break the circuit, and Mama didn't suffer anything more than embarassment (especially now that I've posted this).</p>
<p>I pulled a muscle or something in my back Thursday night, and I was pretty miserable yesterday. Luckily our neighbor Andrea is a physical therapist. Today I feel like I got beat up, which pretty much describes how Andrea treated my back. At least it's an improvement from yesterday.</p>
