<p><i>Dad sure writes a lot about me. But he hasn't posted any pictures lately. I finally talked Mom into posting one of my latest pictures.<br />
Here I'm sitting in my favorite leather chair and catching up on Winnie Pooh's adventures. The book is a gift from my Uncle Steve and Aunt Shannon. They must be having fun shoveling snow in Minnesnowta! Just wanted to say Hi to everybody out there in the Weblog Community!</i></p>
