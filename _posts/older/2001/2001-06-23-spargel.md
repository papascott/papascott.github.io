<p><a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/01/20010622">Garret</a> linked to a NY Times story on the German <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/22/world/22GERM.html">passion</a> for white asparagus. Our neighbor <a href="/2001/04/14">Achim</a> raises asparagus, selling directly at his farmplace. We can see the fields from our backyard. We met some of his Polishworkers at the Dorffest last weekend, and as I write this at 6:00am I can hear the tractor bringing them out to the fields. The season is nearly over; the Poles are going home after this weekend.</p>
<p>It rained all day yesterday for Christopher and Oma Ruth. Christopher was in an excellent mood anyway, racking up many Grandma Brownie Points. She will be moving to nearby Buchholz this fall, they'll be able to see a lot of each other.</p>
