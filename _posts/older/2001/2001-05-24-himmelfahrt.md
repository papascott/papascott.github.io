<p>From  <a href="http://booknotes.editthispage.com/">BookNotes</a>: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/05/24/jeffords.senate/index.html">Jeffords leaves GOP, throwing Senate control to Democrats</a>. Whether or not you agree with the outcome, you can't really say that such a shift in the balance of power is really democratic, now can you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fli4l.de">fli4l</a> (floppy isdn4linux) is a linux router-on-a-floppy system (website mostly in German). It requires just a 386, and includes drivers for isdn, dsl and ethernet, firewall and NAT functions, and a number of utilities for monitoring from linux or windows clients. And it fits on a floppy disk. I've been using a Debian machine as a router up til now, but this looks promising. I've found it by accident, but it was also mentioned in the latest c't (11/2001 p127). <b>Update:</b> Cool, it works! It took me 20 minutes to set up (but then again, I've set up ISDN routers before).</p>
