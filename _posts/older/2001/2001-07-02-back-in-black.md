<p>Another source of news from Germany in English is <a href="http://www.expatica.com/germany.asp">Expatica</a>. For example: <a href="http://www.expatica.com/germanymain.asp?pad=190,205,&item_id=10966">Wild housecats terrify students in Bamberg</a>. </p>
<p>More to the point for us is a report on <a href="http://www.expatica.com/germanymain.asp?pad=197,212,&item_id=10961">German Hausfrauenkultur (Housewives' Culture)</a>. German women are expected to stay home and care for their children until they are out of school. Luckily we can afford an alternative. </p>
<p>I'm (mostly) back up and around, just in time for the work week. Sounds like I missed a good picnic yesterday. The big kids were all playing on a slide too big for Christopher, so he made his own slide on a little hill on the ground, sliding down face first. He came home dirty and exhausted.</p>
<p>Putting heat in perspective: Having lived in both Minnesota and Arizona, my personal feelings of hot and cold are somewhat extreme. I can't really use the word 'hot' to describe any weather in Germany. For example, today is a pleasant, sunny north German summer day, 22&deg;C. According to <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com">Hal</a>, Sunday <a href="http://hal.editthispage.com/2001/07/01">evening</a> in Las Vegas was nearly twice as warm: 43&deg;C (109&deg;F) at 9pm. But in the desert it's a dry heat.</p>
