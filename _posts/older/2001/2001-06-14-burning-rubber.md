<p>Here's another entry for the 'differences between the US and Europe' file. McDonald's Germany co-publishes a monthly movie magazine <a href="http://www.kinonews.de">KinoNews</a> that is distributed in the restaurants and is aimed at teenagers. This month they are advertising a contest for VIP-Tickets to the <a href="http://www.loveparade.de">Love Parade</a> in Berlin. The contest is <a href="http://www.durex.de/de/htm/durex_news.html">sponsored by Durex</a>, a brand of condoms. Would McDonald's USA hang posters advertising condoms to teenagers in their restaurants? I doubt it...</p>
