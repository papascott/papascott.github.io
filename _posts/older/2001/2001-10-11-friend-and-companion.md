<p>Helga, the grey and black tabby cat from the Humane Society in  Minneapolis, who had accompanied us since 1985, died in her sleep this afternoon. She had had heart problems for the past year, and had become progressively weaker the past few weeks. Of our three cats, she was the "party cat". She was the cat we'd see the most around the house, and whenever we had visitors, she always stayed with them. We will miss her.</p>
