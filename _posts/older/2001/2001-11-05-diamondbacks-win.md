<p>Strange. I haven't watched a single inning of baseball this year. I haven't even seen a single pitch. Yet I found myself dreaming of the World Series last night. In my dream it was the Twins against Yankees. Impossible, I know, but it was still a good against evil thing.</p>
<p>In my dream, the Yankees won.</p>
