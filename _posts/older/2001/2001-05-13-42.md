<p>Boys weekend home alone. Mama took off Friday for the second part of her convention and gets back today at noon. Christopher, do we have any cleaning up to do this morning? Nah....</p>
<p>Christopher and I went downtown yesterday. My favorite tech bookstore now has a corner with a rocking horse and Legos. To each their own toys.</p>
