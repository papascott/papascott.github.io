<p>Sometimes it pays to watch the nature shows on TV. In ARD is a film about a bird called <i>Eistaucher</i>, "ice diver"? Never heard of it, so I thought, but it turns out to be the <a href="http://www.khayward.com/loon.html">Common Loon</a> <i>Gavia immer</i>, filmed in northern Minnesota. I thought I recognized that sound. </p>
<p>I'm still here. Mama's out of town until Saturday, so I have both early and late shifts with Christopher, and time is short. How do single parents manage day in and day out? And we're in the middle of a particularly despressing cold and rainy spell.</p>
<p>I did get my Perl programming problem sorted out yesterday, though.</p>
