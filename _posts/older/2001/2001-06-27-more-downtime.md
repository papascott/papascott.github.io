<p><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0106/msg00011.html">debian-devel-announce</a>: "If you install this package... login, su and other programs that ask for a password all fail." I feel like Bart Simpson. "You mean I broke my system so badly that not even root can login without rebooting into single-user mode? Cool!" <i>That's why they call the current distribution "unstable"!</i></p>
<p>To be fair after my anti-Windows rant last night, the 3rd or 4th program I install under Linux is a <a href="http://www.citrix.com">Citrix</a> client to log into an NT Terminal Server. That's necessary for me to be able to use a Lotus Notes client. </p>
<p>I've now gone two weeks without using Netscape (except to check layouts), either at home or at work. It's all <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> and <a href="http://www.konqueror.org">Konqueror</a> now. Konqueror would be my favorite of the three, except for a bug that sometimes makes it send a GET instead of a POST. As a consequence, I'm unable to use it to flip my page.</p>
