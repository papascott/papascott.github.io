Nice to see they have good taste in Madison. Leinenkugel's comes from Chippewa Falls, which is also the birthplace of Seymour Cray, founder of Cray Research. A college buddy of mine who worked for Cray told me they used to include a case of Leinenkugel's with every Cray shipped. Now that I'm a sys admin, I can better appreciate that.</p>
