<p>While Kevin is talking about the US, Germany's position is also a bit of an outlier, being a bit expensive and a bit heavy on public spending. When deciding the future of health care financing in Germany, we probably should look at countries lower and to the left (France, Netherlands, Austria) for examples.</p>
