<p>I kept the promise I made to myself <em>not</em> look at election results until after 6 am (midnight Eastern time), since nothing would be decided before then anyway. I didn't even watch any news last night and went to bed early. I was awake a 4 am, but resisted temptation, rolled over, and went back to sleep. </p>
<p>Sure enough, at 6:30 nothing is decided. It looks like the <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_10_13.html">FL/PA/OH hypothesis</a> is going to hold. Whoever wins 2 of 3 wins everything. But now it's time to wake the kindergarten child...</p>
