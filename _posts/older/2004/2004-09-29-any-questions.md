<p>I haven't posted about my job in a while. Let's see, my laid-off colleagues are now gone, those of us who remain are being absorbed into a new department, our responsibilities are being cut down to a bare minimum, the majority of the employees agreed to a voluntary pay cut (I didn't), the business manager has been kicked upstairs, the chairman has announced his resignation, the September paychecks are late, and we have no word on what will happen next. </p>
<p>That's enough about work.</p>
