<p>I haven't complained about my job in a while, and after this I promise not to complain again for another 3 months. </p>
<p>This week is the ominous "6 weeks before the end of the quarter" deadline when either I or my employer can give notice of termination. I've decided not to leave entirely, but rather to reduce to half time starting 1 December. I had been working 32 hours under <em>Kurzarbeit</em> (short time), but that has now been cancelled, so if I stayed I had to either go back to full time or reduce my hours.</p>
<p>The prospects for free-lancing are not as rosy as I had hoped, and it looks like despite everything that the company will survive. The environment has stabilized, and my work is fun and interesting again.  So I'll stick around and see what happens.</p>
