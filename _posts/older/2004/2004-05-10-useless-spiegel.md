<p>One thing I noticed while on vacation was how utterly useless <a title="SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/">Spiegel Online</a> is for keeping up with German news. Take this evening, for example. Of the 5 'Top Stories', 3 are on the US and Iraq (if I want to read Bush-bashing, I'll go closer to the source), 1 is about sports (Oliver Kahn), and 1 about German news (Finance Minister Eichel). Even under 'Politics' there is little serious domestic news (2 of 7 stories; taxing brothels does not qualify as serious). While other <a title="Davids Medienkritik" href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/">blogs</a> complain about alleged bias in the German media, I would be happy if the premier German news site simply could be somewhat more <em>relevant</em>.</p>
