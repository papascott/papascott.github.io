<p>I've been following Jeff Jarvis and his <a title="BuzzMachine: FCC -- and media -- duped by Brent Bozell's complaint factory" href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_12_06.html#008600">campaign</a> against the FCC and so-called morality in the US media. We don't have an FCC in Germany, but we do have the <em>Bild Zeitung</em> to watch over morals in the media and society... and we have <a href="http://www.bildblog.de/">BildBlog</a> to watch over the <em>Bild Zeiting</em>. Lately, <em>Bild</em> has compained that <a title="BILDblog - Bild sprach zuerst mitÂ… dem Friseur" href="http://www.bildblog.de/index.php?p=332">a gay politician kissed a woman in public</a> ("Is he no longer gay?"), that <a title="BILDblog - Routine" href="http://www.bildblog.de/index.php?p=378">a TV nude scene was cut</a> from a mini-series ("Is she not pretty enough for TV?"), and that Germany's most respected <a title="BILDblog - Christiansen und der Hundesalon" href="http://www.bildblog.de/index.php?p=377">newscaster opened a dog salon</a> ("Massages for rich Fifis"). So our morals in Germany are safe, thanks to <em>Bild</em>. (And thanks to BildBlog, we can know what's in the <em>Bild Zeitung</em> without actually have to read it ourselves.)</p>
