<p>Did Holland really leave both their defense and their midfield at the hotel this evening? Did Germany really play the best 45 minutes I've ever seen them play? Germany leads Holland at halftime 1:0.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Final 1:1. But a good result, and very entertaining to watch. Holland was lucky to tie, and Germany could well have won.</p>
