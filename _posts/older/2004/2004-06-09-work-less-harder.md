<p>When I first saw this graph of the CPU usage at my web host for the last month, I thought that WordPress was using less CPU than Movable Type had. </p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/06/1month-cpumins.png" alt="CPU activity for 1 month" /></p>
<p>But then I remembered that I turned off a busy database cron job at the same time I switched blog software. That must explain it, since MT is busy in spurts, not continuously like in the graph.</p>
