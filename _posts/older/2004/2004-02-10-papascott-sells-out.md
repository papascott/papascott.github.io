<p>No, wait, change that title to "I'm Now A <em>Professional</em> Writer!". I now have Google Ads on my individual entry pages, and on the home page (if you look <em>way</em> at the bottom). I had actually applied to AdSense several months ago, but was rejected then (too many Christopher pics that week?). Inspired by the tasteful addition of ads by <a title="vowe dot net :: Google ads here to stay for a while" href="http://vowe.net/archives/004055.html">vowe</a>, I reapplied.</p>
<p>I am mostly curious about what kind of ads will be selected for my posts. I am also curious whether my writing will change, knowing I will get paid more for better posts. I've already made one change. I had removed the entry title from the individual entries in an effort to discourage casual Googlers. But now I <em>want</em> Googlers to stop by, so I added the titles back. Bring them on!</p>
