<p><a href="http://www.neilarmstrong.de/weblog/2004_08_01_archive.html#109286698366584047">Neil</a> wonders if  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3574334.stm" title="BBC NEWS | Magazine | Unwritten rules of the motorway">this</a> is really true: </p>
<blockquote><p>On the famed German Autobahn, where there are no speed limits, drivers are faster but more considerate.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't know. I very rarely see a <em>Lichthupe</em> (blinking your headlights at the car ahead of you to remind, er, demand they clear the passing lane), but then again, my Renault Twingo spends very little time in the left lane of the Autobahn.</p>
