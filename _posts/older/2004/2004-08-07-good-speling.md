<p>German grammar makes for strange bedfellows. The news publishers Axel Springer (Bild) and Spiegel, which normally don't agree on anything, have <a href="http://www.axelspringer.de/inhalte/pressese/inhalte/presse/3760.html">jointly</a> <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,311777,00.html">announced</a> that that they will <a href="http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsPackageArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&storyID=560816&section=news" title="Reuters | German publishers in revolt over spelling">abandon the German spelling reform</a>, joining the FAZ newspaper as major media using the old (classic?) German spelling rules. Reformed spelling has been taught in schools since 1998, and was to become mandatory in 2005, although I'm not really sure how a government can mandate proper spelling. Wouldn't it be better for spelling to be outsourced to experts like <a href="http://www.duden.de/">Duden</a>?</p>
<p>As for German blogs, as a non-native speaker I don't really care about spelling, but I do find <a href="http://revirement.de/weblog/">lack of capitalization</a> somewhat hard to read.</p>
