<p>Spiegel Online is reporting that Germany's Springer Verlag, Europe's largest newspaper publisher (Bild, Die Welt) <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,291711,00.html" title="Pressebericht: Springer-Konzern will fÃ¼r Daily Telegraph bieten - Wirtschaft - SPIEGEL ONLINE">will make an offer</a> to buy the Daily Telegraph, Great Britain's largest non-tabloid paper. I guess if they can handle Rover and Mini going German, then they can handle a German newspaper, although it would be more fun to see Springer take over a British tabloid, just to see if it would keep printing <a href="http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/stories/storybattlingforthegutter.htm" title="Battling for the gutter">anti-German headlines</a>.</p>
