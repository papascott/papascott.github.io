<p>A lot of people are linking to <a href="http://fury.com/images/weblog/google_circa_1960.jpg">Google circa 1960</a>, but in <a href="http://fury.com/article/2037.php">the comments to the post</a> you can see that I am not the only one who remembers that there weren't any ZIP codes yet in 1960. Or that phone numbers once had letters.</p>
