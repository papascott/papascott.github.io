Not coincidentally there also is Father's Day tomorrow. It's the day when fathers leave their family at home, get social with other fellow sufferers, and drink lots and lots of alcohol, all while cycling (or riding) through the countryside." Sorry, Heiko, only fathers are allowed to participate.</p>
