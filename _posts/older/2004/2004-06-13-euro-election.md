<p><a href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/06/european_parlia.html" title="Davids Medienkritik: European Parliamentary Elections: SPD Suffers Unbelievable Crash">David</a> laughs, <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=321" title="Wahlen in Thüringen und Europa: SPD als Randgruppe">Nico</a> cries. In today's Euro-Parliament election (results presented between <a href="http://www.euro2004.com/">Euro 2004</a> matches), with less than 22% the SPD has its worst national post-war result. They have less than half the vote of the Union (45%). Maybe Schröder should think about buying the rights to Project 18 from the FDP.</p>
<p>What I find worrying is that some of those SPD voters are heading to the ex-communist PDS. Over 6% in the Europe vote, in today's state election in Thuringa over 26% (SPD just 15%).  Fifteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the former SED should by all rights be in the dustbin of history. The failed German reunification is keeping them alive.</p>
