<p>Two years ago we had 5 network sysadmins at our company. Last year we had 3. One left last month, another broke her arm and is out sick, and third one is me. And I am alone until my colleague can peck at a keyboard. And our network is no less complex than when there were 5 of us. Until now I've had nothing to do with our internal routing, I was strictly external. Up until last month I deferred firewall requests to my more knowledgable colleagues. Now, I <em>am</em> the firewall.</p>
<p>I've been able to fake my way through most problems. A couple of routing problems I was not able to fake my through, and thus I was able to "gain valuable experience" (i.e. learn by screwing up). Hint: a router sends packets exactly how it is told. If it isn't told where to find an address, the packets disappear, just like luggage at the airport without a checkin tag . My co-workers are at least sympathetic than I am covering bases for 3 peopel. But my brain hurts at the end of the day. </p>
<p>There is hope on the horizon. Our accomodation, flight, and rental car for Florida in April are as of this evening all booked.</p>
