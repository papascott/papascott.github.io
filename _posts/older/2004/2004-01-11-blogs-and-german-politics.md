<p>Some interesting thoughts at <a title="Weblogs und deutsche Politiker [jimmiz journal]" href="http://jimmiz.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=157">jimmiz journal</a> on the (lack of) blogging and German politics (follow the links there to Nico, Heiko and Moe, I'm too lazy to type them in  here), all the more interesting since Adam Curry seems to getting <a title="Adam Curry's Weblog" href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/2004/01/06.html#a5027">parties and politicians in The Netherlands</a> to start blogging. But Germany does have the <a title="SPD-Horn, Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, Distrikt Hamburg-Horn" href="http://www.spd-horn.de/">SPD in the Hamburg district of Horn</a>, which has been blogging (with Movable Type) since the beginning of December. Keep it up!</p>
