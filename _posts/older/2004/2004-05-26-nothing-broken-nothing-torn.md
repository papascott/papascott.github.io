<p>So, having jumped through all the hoops at the specialist and family doctor this morning, I'm now sure that I didn't do any permanent damage to my <a title="Questions and Answers About Knee Problems" href="http://www.niams.nih.gov/hi/topics/kneeprobs/kneeqa.htm">knee</a> yesterday. I probably stretched a ligament in the knee capsule, which is now inflamed. The pain will subside with rest and ice, although last evening I also found Beck's Gold to be an effective pain killer.</p>
