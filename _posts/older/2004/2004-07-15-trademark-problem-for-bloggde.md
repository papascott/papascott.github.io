<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/14/before_weblogs_blog_.html" title="Boing Boing: Before weblogs, 'blog' was a kind of cocktail at sf cons">Boing boing: </a> "Dr. Seuss's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679886311">'The Shape of Me and Other Stuff'</a> contains these lines: 'And speaking of shapes/now just suppose/you were shaped like one of these!/or those!/or like a Blogg/or a garden hose!' The Blogg in question is pictured only in silhouette (like everything else in the book); it looks sorta like a bipedal camel." Sue! Sue!</p>
