<p>Sunday's election of the German Bundespr채sident is being overshadowed by <a title="BBC NEWS | Europe | Nazi row mars German leader vote" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3736383.stm">the Nazi past</a> of one of the delgates to the federal assembly that choose the president. Hans Filbinger, CDU, was a military judge for the Nazis, and in 1978 resigned as premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg state when his past came to light. At the time he was quoted as saying "what was right then cannot be wrong now". The thing is, this is the <em>fourth</em> time Filbinger has served on the assembly since his resignation. So it was OK in the '90s for ex-Nazi judges to choose the president, and suddenly <a title="Wenn ich Kandidat f체r das Amt des Bundespr채sidenten w채re... [Noch'n Blogg]" href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=238">not OK</a> now? Or has German politics become so polarized that even old news can be dug up for new controversy?</p>
