<p>Polls don't mean anything come election day, but they are interesting nonetheless. The ARD <a title="tagesschau.de : Sonntagsfrage: Union verliert absolute Mehrheit" href="http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID2827436_TYP6_THE2827398_NAV2827398_REF_BAB,00.html">DeutschlandTREND</a>  shows the Union falling below an absolute majority in the "Sunday question" for the first time in 5 months, but still with 48%. Winners were not red/green (26%/10%), but the FDP (7%) and the PDS (5%!). Has the far-left flight from the SPD to the ex-communists begun? </p>
<p>Meanwhile locally, 7 weeks before the Hamburg election <a title="Hamburg: Aktuelle Wahlumfrageergebnisse [jimmiz journal]" href="http://jimmiz.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=156">Mayor von Beust and the CDU have a comfortable lead</a> (47%) over Mirow and the SPD (30%). The Greens have 11%, FDP 2%, old Schill 2%, and new Schill (Pro-DM) 4%.  With coalition partners, von Beust is only 6 points ahead of red/green, and if Schill somehow gets over 5% all bets are off.</p>
