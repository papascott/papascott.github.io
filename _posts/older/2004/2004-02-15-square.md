<p>My home town in Minnesota is exactly 1 mile square, so it almost completely fits on this 1500x1500m picture from <a title="ACME Mapper" href="http://mapper.acme.com/">ACME Mapper</a> (as seen at <a title="Don Park's Daily Habit - Home from Space" href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=685c89e8-7c87-4b1f-96bb-2321305349f3">Don Park</a>). Outside the town are just prairie fields. I spent pretty much my entire high school years within this square.  (Well, not entirely... otherwise I never would have met this German girl I later married....)</p>
