<p>If it worked for <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/004606.html">vowe</a>, maybe it will work for me. If anyone cares to send me an invitation to GMail, you'll earn a gushing but sincere compliment and my eternal gratitude. Any takers?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> All praise be to <a href="http://philringnalda.com/">Phil Ringnalda</a>, who has invited me to partake in the pleasures of GMail.</p>
