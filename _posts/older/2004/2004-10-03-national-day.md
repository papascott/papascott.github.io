<p><img src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/einheit_fahne.jpg" alt="National Day Flag" align="right" /> We were in Berlin <em>sans Christopher</em> over the weekend, as Mama had a gala event to attend with spouse. On Saturday we took in some of the sights. At the Reichstag, the Volksfest for the national holiday on 3 October was already underway. There was a stage with Schlager music, booths with grilled and fried junk food, and lots of trinkets for sale. On the Reichstag lawn dozens of people were playing something that looked like a cross between bocce ball and ring toss. No security of any sort was noticeable. The sun was out,  weather was gorgeous, and I could think of no better atmosphere for a national holiday.</p>
