<p>After 150,000 km, my Twingo is on its last legs, needing new wheel bearings and, after a poor maneuver in the carport a couple of weeks ago, a new front bumper. Oil and TÜV inspection are also due, but it's just not worth putting any more money into. So we've been looking at a replacement, used, under 10,000.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.papascott.de/fotos/lupo.jpeg" alt="VM Lupo" align="right" /> We thought about a <a href="http://www.smart.com/">Smart</a>, but we sometimes need more than 2 seats. Given today's gas prices, we looked seriously at a diesel <a href="http://www.lupousa.com/">VW Lupo 3L TDI</a> (3L stands for 3 liters/100 km, or 78 mpg). However, they are hard to find used, and come at a pretty premium to their less efficient cousins. We expanded our search to all diesel Lupos, found an SDI nearby with a foldback sunroof (very important :-)), and signed the contract today. By Friday I'll be driving German after 12 years of driving French.</p>
