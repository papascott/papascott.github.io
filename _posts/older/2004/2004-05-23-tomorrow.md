<p>1. MamaMaus goes back to work tomorrow after 8 weeks sabbatical.<br />
2. Tomorrow she takes the first flight to Munich for 3 days of meetings. Her alarm is set for 4 am.<br />
3. Christopher's day care is on vacation. We have a substitute, whom I have never met. But I have written down her address. She expects to be paid. In cash.<br />
4. Christopher has his usual speech therapy appointment on Monday afternoon at 4:30 pm.<br />
5. Our carpenter is coming by in the evening to finish up some work in the living room. He expects to be paid. In cash.<br />
6. My employer this week will either declare bankruptcy or be taken over. It does not have enough liquidity to meet this month's payroll.<br />
7. Our new cat is scheduled to have a flea prevention treatment tomorrow.<br />
8. Hopefully I will be able to keep everything straight.<br />
9. Have I forgotten anything?</p>
