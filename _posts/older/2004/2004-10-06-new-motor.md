<p>If you're reading this, then PapaScott is running on a spanking new installation of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>. Because when you like tinkering with old cars, you sometimes have to change the motor, just to see what happens. Things are mostly working, but I have a few bolts left over I don't know what to do with. I'll just set them aside for now...</p>
