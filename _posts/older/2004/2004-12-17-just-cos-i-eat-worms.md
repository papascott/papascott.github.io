<p>Funny, with all the <a title="Movable Type Publishing Platform: Comment spam load issue" href="http://www.movabletype.org/news/2004/12/comment_spam_load_issue.shtml">hoopla about comment spam lately</a>, I haven't gotten a single spam for over a week. My MT-Blacklist log is empty. I had to write a spam myself to convince myself it was still working.</p>
<p>My anti-spam strategy of boring content must be working. Especially now that my Google Page Rank has dropped to 6, I'm simply no longer worth the bother, I hope.</p>
<p>Actually, I think <a title="MT Plugin: Conversation Killer" href="http://www.chompy.net/lab/mt/conversationkiller/">closing comments on old entries</a> helps more than anything.</p>
