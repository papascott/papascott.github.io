<p>Listening to weblogs being read aloud on stage seems to me as exciting as, say, listening to sheet music being read aloud while watching paint dry, but if you're into that sort of thing, <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002589.shtml" title="Blogs! in Berlin by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com">Heiko</a> and <a href="http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=879" title="Vorgelesen! [Lummaland - das Weblog]">Nico</a> were in Berlin last night doing just that. No word on whether the paint was dry by the end of the evening or not.</p>
