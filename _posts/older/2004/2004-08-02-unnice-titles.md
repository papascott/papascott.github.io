<p>Is anyone else annoyed as hell by <a href="http://philringnalda.com/">sites</a> that <a href="http://bradchoate.com/">implement</a> so-called <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/nicetitle/">Nice titles</a>? I personally find them to be just as bad as browser pop-ups, and I wish I could set my <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">browser</a> to never show them. Ever.</p>
