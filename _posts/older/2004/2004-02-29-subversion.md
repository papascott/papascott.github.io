<p>Pardon me while I dance a jig in the living room. I finally got <a title="a compelling replacement for CVS" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> working on Solaris 8. It doesn't work out of the box, you have to know the proper <a title="subversion dev: Solaris report: svn 0.37 success on sparc solaris 8" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=57624">incantation</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, you have every right to ask what I am doing working on Solaris at 7 am on Sunday. It's because <a title="BBC: 'Napalm' speech tops movie poll" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3362603.stm">I love the smell of napalm in the morning</a>.</p>
