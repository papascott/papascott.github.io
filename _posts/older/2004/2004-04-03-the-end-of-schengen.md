<p><a title="John Robb's Weblog" href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2004/04/02.html#a4491">John Robb:</a> "<a href="http://wireservice.wired.com/wired/story.asp?section=Breaking&storyId=845381&tw=wn_wire_story">Reuters</a> Visitors from visa-waiver countries (UK, Germany, etc.) will all be photographed and fingerprinted when they enter the US.[...]  There is clearly foot dragging by visa-waiver countries on the new US requirement for vistors to have passports with biometric data (something the US doesn't have) for unimpeded entry." If this is the trend, does this mean the end of the borderless EU, at least in the long term?</p>
