<p>Still no paychecks for September. We're supposed to be getting paid any day now. I guess that makes us creditors.</p>
<p>Actually, we get paystubs, since being Germany, paychecks are direct deposited. But no paystubs either, meaning the money hasn't yet been transferred, and the money always takes 2 or 3 days to hit the bank.</p>
