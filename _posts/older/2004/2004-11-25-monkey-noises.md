<p>Looking through one of my new Bloglines feeds, I saw this about <a title="North Sea Diaries - Slumming it" href="http://www.north-sea.net/archives/208">Spanish soccer fans taunting black English players</a> with monkey noises. That reminds me of my first sports experience in Hamburg. In the fall of 1990, I ventured alone to the Volksparkstadion to watch <a href="http://www.hsv.de/">HSV</a> play Frankfurt, and was disgusted at how the Hamburg fans grunted like monkeys every time the black Frankfurt striker touched the ball. I've never seen HSV since, and still hold a mild distain for HSV and their fans. But I only rarely make fun of children whose parents make them wear HSV gear. Only rarely. But more often when HSV is doing poorly.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, that black striker was Anthony Yeboah, who later in his career played for... you guessed it, HSV.</p>
