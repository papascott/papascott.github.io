<p>One thing I remember about living in Minnesota is that it was illegal to buy alcohol on election day. <a title="Minnesota DPS: Alcohol Enforcement: Frequently Asked Questions" href="http://www.dps.state.mn.us/alcgamb/alcenf/alcfaq.html#when_open">Nice to see that has changed.</a> Prost. (Old news, I see. The election day liquor ban was lifted in <a title="Sacred Sundays open for business" href="http://www.in-forum.com/specials/century/jan3/week36.html">1991</a>.)</p>
