<p>Mama's travel schedule has been heck the past 8 weeks. Right now her employer is holding 3 2-day meetings one after the the other, extending through Monday. So Christopher and I are baching it for the second consecutive weekend. The good news that after that she'll be home on paid sabbatical for the next two months. I wonder if she'll know what to do with herself? Meanwhile, tomorrow Christopher and I will be seeing the new <a title="BÄRENBRÜDER" href="http://www.disney.de/DisneyKinofilme/baerenbrueder/">Disney film</a>, and hopefully it won't rain the entire weekend. <em>Update</em> On Saturday afternoon we're off to a good start, it's rained all day... :-(</p>
