<p>Christopher's favorite website is the <a href="http://www.airbus.com/media/video_clips.asp">video page at Airbus</a>, especially the <a href="http://www.airbus.com/video/media/mpegs/concorde_l.mpg">Concorde's final landing</a>. So it was only natural that he wanted a toy Concorde of his very own. </p>
<p>At German toy stores we could only find tiny models for collectors for 20, but on eBay we found a <a href="http://www.givesomecharacter.com/phdi/p1.nsf/supppages/givesome?OpenDocument&part=14">shop</a> in Great Britain that  sold a <a href="http://www.corgi.co.uk/CorgiSite/pages/product/product.asp?ctlg=Corgi&ctgry=Toys&prod=59902">model by Corgi</a> for around 12 (incl. postage). It arrived today.</p>
