<p><a title="tagesschau.de : Gedenken an Rosa Luxemburg und Karl Liebknecht" href="http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID2829678_REF1,00.html">tagesschau.de:</a> "Tens of thousands in Berlin rememembered Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Leibknecht with a silent march through the memorial Berlin-Friedrichsfelde. The founders of the German Communist Party were killed on January 15, 1919. Wreaths were laid by leading PDS figures, including party leader Lothar Bisky... The traditional march is one of the largest demonstrations in the German capital."</p>
