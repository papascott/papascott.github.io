<p>Spiegel Online: <a title="Verheerende Bilanz: Aufbau Ost laut Geheimdossier gescheitert - Wirtschaft - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,293921,00.html">Secret government commission declares rebuilding of eastern Germany a failure</a> "Immense unemployment, an overaged population: a secret circle of advisors to the German government has declared the rebuilding of eastern Germany in its present form for a failure. The paper accuses the goverment of lack of concept and inaction in the east." 1.2 trillion Euros down the drain (and you thought the war in Iraq was expensive). Meanwhile, former Warsaw Pact allies of the DDR will be joining the EU next month. Would the ex-DDR have been better off without the misguided help of the BRD? Would Europe as a whole have been better off?</p>
