<p>Last night we hosted a <em>Laternenumzug</em> for Christopher's <em>Tagesmutter</em>, even though Christopher has now graduated to Kindergarten and no longer attends day care. We had about 16 parents and 8 children marching in the drizzle through the fields with paper lanterns. We set up hay bales and some Halloween decorations in the carport, and offered pretzels and warm drinks. The kids played in the back yard, pretending it was not dark. Most of Heidi's kids are younger than 3, so most of the guests headed home by 8 pm.  A hard core stayed a little longer.</p>
