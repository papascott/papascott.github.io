<p><a href="https://www.papascott.de/ConvertingManila/">Good News!</a> <a href="http://q.queso.com/">Jason Levine's</a> Frontier script has worked! <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/">Susan</a> now has a working MT Import File. Jason says he'll be posting his script in the next few days, and since UserLand offfers a 60-day trial version of Manila for download (thanks, <a href="http://www.ahawkins.org/blog/">Alwin</a>, for the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/06/22/Converting-Manilla#c1087948312">tip</a>), I'm hopeful that we can come up with a procedure for people to export their own sites. Many thanks to <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a> for the A-list publicity and support. </p>
<p>&lt;snideComment&gt;Funny that a bunch of ex-Manila users had to do this by themselves, and that noone from UserLand or weblogs.com even acknowledged our effort.&lt;/snideComment&gt;</p>
