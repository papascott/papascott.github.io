<p>The ARD newscast Tagesschau has started a weblog about the US election campaign at <a href="http://www.blog.tagesschau.de/" title="Das Weblog von tagesschau.de">blog.tagesschau.de</a> by three of their foreign correspondents in the US. No comments, no trackbacks, but at least they have permalinks.  As <a href="http://weblog.plasticthinking.org/item/2004/7/26/die-tagesschau-bloggt" title="Die Tagesschau bloggt - PlasticThinking: Moe's Blog">Moe asks</a>, are they just jumping on a fad, or will they also write about (ahem) <em>German</em> themes?</p>
