<p>Merkel and Stoiber finally agree on something. <a href="http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=52&story_id=12737&name=Berlin+rejects+call+for+petitionagainst+Turkey's+EU+membership" title="Expatica %u2014 Living in, moving to, or working in Germany, plus German news in English">Union party leaders call for petition against EU membership for Turkey</a>. <a href="http://jimmiz.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=651" title="Frau Merkel und der unheilige Halbmond [jimmiz journal]">Jim</a> calls this "mobbing at the highest level" and wonders:</p>
<blockquote><p>"What comes next? 'The Ugly Turk'? Should we buy our produce only from the Dutch? Will the crescent have to be worn on clothing?" (translation mine)</p></blockquote>
<p>No, it won't come to that, but the campaign does evoke ugly emotions. One can be <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002544.shtml" title="Pitching Turkey by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com">for</a> or <a href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002543.shtml" title="EU and Turkey by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com">against</a> Turkish membership, but the issue belongs in parliament, not on the street. At a time when far-right parties are <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/19/brown-nosing/" title="PapaScott: Brown Nosing">making gains at the polls</a>, I'd expect democratic parties to do better than try to ride on their coattails. Shame on CDU/CSU.</p>
