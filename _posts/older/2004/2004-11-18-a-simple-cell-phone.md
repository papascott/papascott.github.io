<p>She doesn't know it yet, but we are about to drag my mother-in-law kicking and screaming into the 21st century. We are getting her a cell phone. She's 70 years old and drives alone, sometimes at night. She needs a mobile phone in case of emergency. We'll convince her of that. But she's techno-phobic. She doesn't even like using a remote control for her TV.</p>
<p>We have a several old phones, so hardware is not a problem. I have a Motorola Timeport I picked up for &euro;3 from work. It seems to be the cell phone we have that looks the most like a normal phone. The menus are way too complicated, though. I wish I could disable everything except the phone book. All she needs to do is to make and receive calls.</p>
<p>Following <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/005129.html" title="vowe dot net :: Do not use mobile roaming in Germany">vowe's advice</a>, I bought a prepaid SIM from <a href="http://www.tchibo.de/">Tchibo</a> for &euro;20, including &euro;10 credit good for one year. All domestic calls cost 35 cents per minute anytime. That's simple enough to remember, and Tchibo coffee shops are all over to buy more credit.</p>
<p>We'll give her the phone for <em>Nikolaus</em> on December 6. We'll have to think of a way to put it in her shoes.</p>
