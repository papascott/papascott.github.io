<p>Spiegel Online: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,306732,00.html" title="Beziehungsstress: Tourist lÃ¤sst Ehefrau an Tankstelle stehen - Panorama - SPIEGEL ONLINE">German tourist leaves wife at gas station</a> "Returning with their camper from a vacation on the Arctic Circle, a German tourist from Stuttgart left his wife at a Danish gas station after a heavy argument and never returned. The woman was allowed to sleep on a mattress at a police station, and was sent home by train the next day." That could never happen to us, since my wife always drives. &lt;rimShot /&gt;</p>
