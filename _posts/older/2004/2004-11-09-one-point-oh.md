<p>Despite my reservations about the release, I of course downloaded <a title="Firefox - Rediscover the web" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox 1.0</a> as soon as it was available. And lo and behold, the <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/08/firefox-not-ready/">hesitation</a> on <a href="http://jsiwwe.jsjjeidnhwnnds.com/">bad hostnames</a> under Linux has been fixed (it passes the request to the proxy server immediately instead of waiting for a DNS lookup). </p>
<p>I still don't get all gushy about a web browser though. It's just a tool.</p>
