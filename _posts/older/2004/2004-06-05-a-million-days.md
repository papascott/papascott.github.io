<p>If you've been following the soap opera that is my workplace, be assured that all is not peaches and cream. Yes, the company has found an investor, a venture capital fund rather than a competitor, so our existance is ensured for the short term and entire departments will not be rationalized away. But the investors are expecting further cost-cutting, which means management will be proposing a salary reduction package in the next few days. However, we've been in cost-cutting mode for over 3 years now, a mode that is very tiresome, and whatever trust the employees had in management is long gone. Noone is in the mood to give up anything.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the investor has a share in some 30 other high-tech companies, some of whom might be interested in our software. It might be good to extend away from the banking industry, which is notoriously tight-fisted and slow-paying.</p>
