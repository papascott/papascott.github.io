<p><a href="http://www.pepilog.de/artikel/olympia-presswurst.htm" title="Olympia-Presswurst - Pepilog">Pepilog</a> summed up the German TV coverage of the Olympics so far. My translation: "There's nothing wrong with saying 'you can see the athlete is disappointed', but why do they have to say things like 'that's very disappointing for us' or 'Germany is deeply disappointed with the result'? For example, in the USA when an American athlete is successful, the media will report on him extensively. If the results are not that good, they will remain silent. In Germany the successes are only briefly mentioned, but the failures are analyzed in every detail and the pain of the athletes are shown for days, even weeks."</p>
