<p>As reported in the <a title="Ronald Schill wirbt mit Telefonanrufen fÃ¼r sich" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2004/02/28/267589.html">Abendblatt</a> and personally experienced by <a title="Wahl in Hamburg: ProDM" href="http://interferno.org/wahlinhamburg/archiv/001923.html">Jimmi</a>, Pro-DM candidate and former Judge Merciless Ronald Schill resorted to recorded telephone messages 2 days before Sunday's election in Hamburg. It's the first time I've heard of such telemarketing techniques in a German election campaign, and I imagine most voters were confused or angered by the calls.  But Judge Merciless needs the help... polls put his new party well under the 5% it needs to enter the Hamburg parliament.</p>
