<p>Vacation update: 3 pm, 6 phone calls to Delta, all day waiting for courier to call, and still no missing suitcase. First day of vacation ruined. So far our story matches this <a href="http://www.complaints.com/october2003/complaintoftheday.october31.30.htm">complaint about Delta Baggage Service</a>, so things may not get better. <em>Update</em> We have it. Mama decided it was useless to deal with the call center, and drove to the airport to talk to someone in person. One phone call, the courier brought the bag. Advice to Delta: dump the outsourced call center.</p>
