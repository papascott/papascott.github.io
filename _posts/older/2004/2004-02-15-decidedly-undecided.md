<p>Like <a title="NDR Online: Wahltest [Noch'n Blogg]" href="http://blogg.lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=33">Nico</a>, I decided to take the <a href="http://www.ndr.de/ndr/regional/hh/wahl/wahltest/">'Voter's Test'</a> at NDR4 to determine which party in Hamburg would best reflect my position. The result was amusing. </p>

"It is difficult to place you in a particular party. You correspond almost equally with FDP, CDU, and SPD." My politics are middle-of-the-road German (or maybe, to put it another way, simply wishy-washy).</p>
<p>Of course,  I'm not actually eligible to vote in Hamburg (seeing as I don't live there and am not a German citizen), so I haven't really bothered to formulate exact positions. On law and order I'm rather liberal, I think the harbor and the Airbus plant should be expanded, I don't think the city needs to own hospitals and apartment complexes. That almost sounds like the FDP, except that the FDP is run by a bunch of idiots, especially in Hamburg.</p>
