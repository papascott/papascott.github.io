<p>After saying that <a href="/archives/2004/08/10/phish-me-not/">that I hadn't heard of any phishing</a> for German online banking passwords, I've now come across three in the past two weeks. <a href="http://vowe.net/archives/004845.html" title="vowe dot net :: Isch 'abe gar keine Postbank Konto">The latest</a> involves the Postbank, and gets around PIN/TAN authentication by asking for a TAN directly on the fake login page. I assume the "login" is never successful to make you keep entering new TANs. They copied the layout pretty exactly, even the commented CVS information is in the source. If you're curious look at postbanks dot info.</p>
