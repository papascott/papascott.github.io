<p>I was just telling Christopher that Mama is so far away in Australia, that it's already morning there even though it's evening here. He then starts explaining to me that the earth is round, Australia is on the other side of the earth from Germany, and that the earth rotates while the sun stays still. That's why it's already morning in Australia. He rotates his fist as the earth while holding the "sun" in his other hand to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Once he was convinced that I understood, he went back to his dessert.</p>
