<p>I'm just wondering, what's the oldest active German weblog? How many German blogs that were early adopters of first wave of blogging services like <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> (Aug 1999), <a href="http://www.diaryland.com/">Diaryland</a> (Sept 1999), and <a href="http://www.editthispage.com/">EditThisPage</a> (Dec 1999) are still active? </p>
<p>I'm familiar with the EditThisPage crowd... <a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/">Andrea</a> started in January 2000 and is still going strong. I think her husband <a href="http://www.spicynoodles.net/">Andr&eacute;</a> (who worked for Userland at the time) was using Manila before EditThisPage went public, but now he now posts only once every other year, so I'm not sure he can be called active. Are there any other German '99ers?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Ah, I had forgotten <a href="http://traumwind.de/blog/">Martin</a> was also among the very first ETPers. And <a href="http://traumwind.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$1">his first post</a> was just a few days before Andrea's.</p>
<p>PapaScott was an early adopter of EditThisPage, but I'm not German, so I don't qualify.</p>
