<p>As seen at <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/27/0250250&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=126&amp;tid=154&amp;tid=95" title="Slashdot | Firefox Extension Lets You Pick the Name">slashdot</a>, <a href="http://www.cosmicat.com/software/firesomething/">firesomething</a> is an extension for <s>firebird</s>, er, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">firefox</a> that will rename the browser at random, with different names for each window. Best of all, you can put the random name into your User Agent, so you can mess with the minds of webmasters who spend too much time reading their logs. Right now I am browsing with Mooncow and posting with Waterworm. Just so you know.</p>
