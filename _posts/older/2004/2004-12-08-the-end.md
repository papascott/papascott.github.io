<p><a title="The End: Hamburg 1943 by Hans Erich Nossack" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/16499.ctl">The End: Hamburg 1943 by Hans Erich Nossack</a> just published in English translation. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>One didnÂ’t dare to inhale for fear of breathing it in. It was the sound<br />
of eighteen hundred airplanes approaching Hamburg from the south at an<br />
unimaginable height. We had already experienced two hundred or even<br />
more air raids, among them some very heavy ones, but this was something<br />
completely new. And yet there was an immediate recognition: this was<br />
what everyone had been waiting for, what had hung for months like a<br />
shadow over everything we did, making us weary. It was the end.</em></p>
<p>Novelist Hans Erich Nossack was forty-two when the Allied bombardments of German cities began, and he watched the destruction of Hamburg--the city where he was born and where he would later die--from across its Elbe River. He heard the whistle of the bombs and the singing of shrapnel; he watched his neighbors flee; he wondered if his home--and his manuscripts--would survive the devastation. The End is his terse, remarkable memoir of the annihilation of the city, written only three months after the bombing. A searing firsthand account of one of the most notorious events of World War II, The End is also a meditation on war and hope, history and its devastation. And it is the rare book, as W. G. Sebald noted, that describes the Allied bombing campaign from the German perspective.</p></blockquote>
