<p>Maybe it's just me, but I would think that being laid off by General Motors would be a good chance for me to take stock of my life, leave a dead-end industry, and find a real job. Although I guess the fact that I was working for General Motors would be a sign I hadn't thought real hard about my future. Like, say, <a title="Yahoo! News - Opel management, workers set for head-on clash as work stoppages continue" href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/afp/20041018/bs_afp/germany_us_auto_strike_041018235539">the wildcat strikers at the Opel factory in Bochum</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, my present job doesn't really have much of a future either, so what do I know?</p>
