<p>The German Consitutional Court today ruled that <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1431_A_1231041_1_A,00.html" title="High Court Rejects Liberalizing Store Hours | Business & Economics | Deutsche Welle | 09.06.2004">the national store closing law is not unconstitutional</a>. So one of the more annoying peculiarities of German life won't be disappearing just yet. But it will probably better if the law is done away with by lawmakers in Berlin rather than a court ruling in Karlsruhe.</p>
<p>An argument by unions for keeping the law is the protection of retail workers, although I have no idea why they deserve more protection than public safety, health care, or restaurant workers who work on evenings and Sundays. If Germany had a functioning and flexible labor market, retail workers would be easily be able to find jobs that match their private schedule. But if Germany had a functioning and flexible labor market, the country would have a lot less problems period.</p>
