<p><a title="Yahoo! Sports - MLB - Red Sox 3, Cardinals 0" href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap;_ylc=X3oDMTBpa2lpNnFzBF9TAzk1ODYxNzc3BHNlYwN0bQ--?gid=241027124">Red Sox win World Series</a> "It was Boston's sixth championship, but the first after 86 years of frustration and futility, after two world wars, the Great Depression, men on the moon, and the rise and fall of the Soviet Union."
