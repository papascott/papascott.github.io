<p>Jeff Jarvis: <a title="BuzzMachine... Fear" href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_02.html#006242">Fear</a> and <a title="BuzzMachine... Change and Fear: What they got wrong about America" href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_02.html#006251">change</a>. I may not agree with all of his conclusions, but I do agree with his reasoning. Blaming the voters or the media or blaming anybody is not the answer. Voters are by definition always right, and if the Democrats want to beat Bush this fall, they have know what the voters want. And they don't want to be told that they are wrong. Outsiders wanting to understand the current mood in the US would do well to read these.</p>
