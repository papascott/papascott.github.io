<p>A couple of weeks ago one of my co-workers told me, "Well, your wife's no <a title="Uschi & Uschi" href="http://www.uschi-und-uschi.de/home/">Uschi</a>." I wasn't sure what he was talking about, but thanks to the Abendblatt, <a title="Mit Uschi auf die Sonnenseite" href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2004/05/29/300043.html">now I know</a>. Uschis are women who are "blond, naive, helpless and successful", who are able to get men to do everything for them. A <a title="SUPER ILLU ONLINE - Beauty & Wellness" href="http://www.super-illu.de/frauen/starke_Frauen/verona.shtml">Verona Feldbusch</a> type. And there's even a book on <a title="Amazon.de: BÃ¼cher: Das Uschi-Prinzip" href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3426777592">how to be a good Uschi</a>. So I guess I can glad I don't have an Uschi (as in <em><a title="bimbo" href="http://dict.leo.org/?search=Tussi">Tussi</a></em>) for a wife.</p>
