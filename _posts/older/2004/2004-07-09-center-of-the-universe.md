<p>As further proof that Hamburg is not only the city of eternal rain, but also the center of the known blogging universe, this Sunday we have not one, but <em>two</em> independently organized face-to-face blogging events: <a href="http://www.hamburgstories.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloggerBrunch">BloggerBrunch</a><br />
in the morning in the city and <a href="http://wiki.langbartels.de/wiki/index.cfm?BlogGrill">Blog Grill 3</a> in the afternoon closer to LÃ¼neburg. Alas, we have visitors from abroad on Sunday, and I won't be able to make it to either event.</p>
