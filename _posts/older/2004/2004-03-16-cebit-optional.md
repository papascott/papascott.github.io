<p>Just for the record, I won't be at the <a title="CeBIT - Homepage Englisch" href="http://www.cebit.de/homepage_e?x=1">CeBIT</a> this year, even though <a title="BlogMeet at CeBIT by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com" href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/001897.shtml">several Hamburg bloggers</a> will be atttending the world's largest cattle stampede, er, I mean computer and IT trade show in Hannover (insert gratuitous Hannover joke here). Funny, back when I was not in the industry, I used to go to CeBIT on my own nickel. Nowadays, even though my company exhibits there, I have no desire to join the herd. Moo.</p>
