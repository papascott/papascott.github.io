<p>Re: <a title="Six Log: How are you using the tool?" href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/05/how_are_you_usi.shtml">Six Log: How are you using the tool?</a> I do pro-bono work on websites for several non-profit organizations. It would be prohibitively expensive to purchase a commercial license for each of these sites. Sincerely, Scott Hanson</p>
