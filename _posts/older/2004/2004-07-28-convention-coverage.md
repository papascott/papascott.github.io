<p>If you're looking for <em>interesting</em> convention coverage, check out <a href="http://newyork.ninjastu.com/">Adam Fuller</a>. He's one of the techs trying to keep the WiFi up and running in Boston, and he says that <a href="http://newyork.ninjastu.com/archives/000124.html">bloggers stink</a>. Literally. <a href="http://q.queso.com/archives/001446">(via Q Daily News)</a></p>
