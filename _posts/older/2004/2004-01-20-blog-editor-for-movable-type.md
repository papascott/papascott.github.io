<p>For the editors of our <a title="L&uuml;llauer Gegen-Wind" href="http://www.luellauergegenwind.de/">neighborhood initiative website</a> I'd like to find a blogging ap that makes editing under Windows as easy as possbile. Is there a good WYSIWYG blog editor out there? <a href="http://www.zempt.com">Zempt</a> looks nice, and the price is right, but it isn't WYSIWYG. <a href="http://www.blogjet.com">BlogJet</a> isn't ready yet. Am I missing something obvious? Or should I be looking at inline solutions like <a href="http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/">htmlArea</a>?</p>
<p><b>Update</b> <a href="http://www.hebig.com">Heiko</a> pointed me to <a href="http://w.bloggar.com">w.bloggar</a>, which again isn't WYSIWYG (but like Zempt has a preview window) but is localized for German. I'm posting this update with it.</p>
