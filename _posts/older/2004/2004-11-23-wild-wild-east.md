<p>I enjoyed talking with <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/dolboeb/" title="Anton Nossik's LiveJournal Notes">Anton Nossik</a> last night after the discussion. (The LiveJournal link is his personal blog, professionally he has several Russian news sites including <a href="http://www.mosnews.com/" title="MOSNEWS.COM">mosnews.com</a> in English.) It was interesting to hear his main first impression of Germany: the "friendly" roads and drivers. The autobahns are certainly well built, and built for speed, but are German drivers really friendly? But then I remembered the t.A.T.u. album title "200 km/h in the Wrong Lane"... if that's a description of Russian driving, then German drivers must seem very friendly indeed. </p>
<p>When I told him I came from Minnesota, he immediately thought of the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/">Fargo</a>, and asked if Minnesotans really use wood chippers that way (if you've never seen the movie, don't ask...). He also got the impression that Minnesota is colder than Moscow. Somehow I doubt that.</p>
<p>Finally, he refuted one of my misconceptions about journalists. I had just maintained on the train ride to Cologne to Heiko and Gerd that the difference between journalists and bloggers is that blogger are can choose *not* to write, that they do not have a quota of minutes or column inches to fill. But Anton told me of a certain business dispute in Russia where both sides were paying him *not* to report the details, a form of reverse PR. He had no problems with that, since he wasn't intending to report on it anyway, but he was still disappointed when the dispute was settled.</p>
