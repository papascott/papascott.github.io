<p>Why is it that any time Spiegel Online reports on a topic about which I have personal knowledge, they turn out to be completely full of shit? Latest case in point, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,324622,00.html" title="US-Wahlen in Deutschland: Marschbefehl zur Urne - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE">Marching Orders to Vote</a>, in which the Bush Administration is supposedly hindering civilian expats from voting. </p>
<p>Bullshit. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.fvap.gov/">fvap.gov website</a>, it was never easier for me to arrange for my American absentee ballot than it was this year. I never had any problems reaching the site, <a href="http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000001/2004/09/23.html#a6620" title="Adam Curry's Weblog">even in September</a> when the story of problems first surfaced (i.e. Spiegel is a month late on this).</p>
<p>Of course, the Medienkritiker are <a href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/spiegel_online__5.html" title="Davids Medienkritik: SPIEGEL ONLINE: Marching Orders to Vote">calling Spiegel on this</a> as well.</p>
