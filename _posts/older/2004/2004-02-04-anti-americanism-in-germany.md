<p>I remember when it meant something to be anti-American, when one had to really prove himself to earn this title. Kidnap Americans, take over their embassies, kill and maim them, burn their homes and businesses. Now that standard has been lowered. According to this <a title="Davids Medienkritik: German Contradictions / Deutsche WiderspÃ¼che" href="http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/this_is_an_exce.html">thread at Medienkritik</a> (a blog dedicated to anti-Americanism), these days it's enough to read Michael Moore and oppose the Iraq war. Sorry, for me expressing opinion is as American as it gets, and merely expressing opinions against a particular administration, especially when the same opinions are held by a good number of Americans, does <em>not</em> qualify one as anti-American. No, to become anti-American you need to threaten me for who I am, for the color of my passport. Mere disagreement does not qualify.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the thread brings a number of offensive anti-German prejudices to light. Germans are Nazis. Germans are greedy. Germans never forgive. Germans are undemocratic. Replace all the 'Germans' with 'Jews', and you'd have a number of quotes worthy of Martin Hohmann.</p>
