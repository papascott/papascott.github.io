<p>Today is triple Mozilla witching day, with new releases of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> (browser) and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> (mail client) and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla</a> (kitchen sink) (which makes 9 downloads for those of us using Mac/Windows/Linux). Most interesting is  <a href="http://www.unclespam.org/2004/09/mozilla-adds-rss-support-to-firefox.html">the addition of RSS/Atom feed readers</a> into <strike>all three</strike> er, the first two products. At first glance the integration into Thunderbird mail folders seems more useful than Firefox dynamic bookmarks, but to each his own, and the more readers the merrier.</p>
