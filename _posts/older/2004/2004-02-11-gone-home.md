<p>Unfortunately we have bad news about my aunt Violet, who I <a title="PapaScott: State of Mind" href="https://www.papascott.de/2004/02/01/2846.php">mentioned</a> last week. The feeding tube did not take, her kidneys started to fail, and the decision was made to take no more heroic measues. She slept most of the weekend, and died quietly on Monday afternoon, at age 97. She was one of Christopher's biggest fans, always showing an album of the pictures we had sent and published on this website. Times like this it hurts to be so far away.</p>
