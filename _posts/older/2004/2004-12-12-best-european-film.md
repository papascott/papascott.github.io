<blockquote><p>"Gegen Die Wand" ("Head-On"), about a young Turkish woman in Germany who escapes her strict Muslim home through a difficult marriage with an older man, won the best film award in the competition dubbed the "European Oscars" on Saturday... The European Film Awards sealed the remarkable success of "Gegen Die Wand", which overcame a scandal over its star's porn movie past to score a German box-office success and win major prizes including the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. As well as best film, Turkish-German Fatih Akin collected the best director award for "Gegen Die Wand" in the People's Choice category on Saturday."</p></blockquote>
<p>Akin lives and works in Hamburg-Altona, and much of the film was shot there.</p>
