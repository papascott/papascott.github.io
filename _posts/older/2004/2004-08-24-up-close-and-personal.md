<p>I haven't been paying real close attention to the Olympics, but I did make sure to watch the women's 1500 m heat this evening to see if <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/athletebios/5030697/detail.html" title="NBCOlympics.com - Athlete Bios - Carrie Tollefson">Carrie Tollefson</a> would qualify for the next round. Carrie is from my hometown... welll, not exactly, she's actually from the town next to my hometown. And, I don't exactly know her (she was 3 years old when graduated from high school), but it's a small county where everyone knows everyone else, so I must know her cousin or something. (And like my wife said, Tollefson is a good, solid Minnesota last name.) And, yes, <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/results/5001368/detail.html">she did make the semi-finals</a>, so she runs again in Athens on Thursday. Go, Carrie, go!</p>
