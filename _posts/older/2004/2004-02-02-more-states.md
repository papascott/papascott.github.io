<p>One thing I forgot to mention about states visited (other than that even <a title="Visited States by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com" href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/001933.shtml">Germans</a>  are jumping in) is that I've noticed that most folks have not been to Minnesota. Figures, it's not really a state that one travels <i>through</i> (unless one is taking a road trip to, say, Winnipeg). And even if one is flying <a title="Northwest Airlines, the state airline of the Midwest" href="http://www.nwa.com/">Aeroflot-USA</a>, nowadays you're more likely to change planes at Detroit or Memphis than at their home base of MSP. Or are people letting those 50 below temperatures scare them off? Wimps.</p>
