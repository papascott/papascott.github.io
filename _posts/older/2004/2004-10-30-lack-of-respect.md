<p>If nothing else, the <a title="The New York Times > International > Bin Laden Takes Responsibility for 9/11 Attacks in New Tape" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/international/30osamaCND.html?ex=1256788800&en=5ff84d6f759ad30b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland">Bin Laden video</a> shows a lack of respect for the American electoral process. He needed <a title="11 March 2004 Madrid attacks - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_11_Madrid_bombing">bombs</a> to influence the election in Spain, but thinks a video is all he needs for the US.</p>
