<p>We finally have a humble start on the web site for <a title="Lüllauer Gegen-Wind" href="http://www.luellauergegenwind.de/">Lüllauer Gegen-Wind</a>, our village initiative against wind generators. Our neighbor Michael has gathered a ton of material on the subject, and my wfie and I are trying to filter and organize that information. I used Movable Type to set it up, but it's not a weblog yet, no comments or trackbacks, and we still have the default MT design. But I thought I'd mention it here for the benefit of Google, as well as for any other readers who are interested.</p>
