<p>Much to my surprise, our DSL connection was activated on schedule today and the splitter arrived with today's post. Alas, our ISDN NTBA and DSL splitter are in our basement washroom, where I have no ethernet cable, so we can surf from the washing machine but not from our desktop PCs. I've put our WLAN access point in our entryway under the coat rack, with a cable to the basement, so we can at least use our notebooks until I can cable things correctly.</p>
