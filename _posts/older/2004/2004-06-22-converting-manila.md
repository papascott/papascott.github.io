<p>Back in April 2002, I converted my Manila weblog at editthispage.com to Movable Type using XML files exported from Manila and a simple Perl script (using XML::Twig).</p>
<p>This month (2 weeks <em>before</em> the weblogs.com outage), Susan Kitchens found my old script and asked me about converting her Manila site <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org">http://www.2020hindsight.org</a> (after she had painstakingly extracted her site into XML). I thought that the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtimport.html">Movable Type Import Format</a> would be a good target, since it can be imported into many different weblogging systems.</p>
<p>However, Manila had become more complicated in the meantime, and I was unable to quickly apply my script to Susan's files (i.e. I've gotten stuck), and I'm short of time. Since a <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/06/15/Archive-Restore">number of people</a> had publicly offered to help export Manila sites, people with a probably a better understanding of Manila and XML than I have, I decided to plea for help via a Wiki page entitled <a href="https://www.papascott.de/ConvertingManila">ConvertingManila</a>.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
