<p>German media don't understand American politics, so they come to some funny conclusions. Case in point: Spiegel Online suggests that John Kerry find a running mate from the South, for example <a title="US-Wahlkampf: Kerry sucht eine/n Vize - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,289540,00.html">Hillary Clinton</a> (Senator from New York, birthplace Chicago). She's been accused of many things, but being a Southerner is not one of them. (Oh, and by the way, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson is not a Southerner either.)</p>
