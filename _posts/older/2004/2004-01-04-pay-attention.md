<p>This is what I get for not paying attention. I've been assuming that I wouldn't have a voice in deciding the Democratic presidential nominee, but now I see that Arizona, the state where I was last a resident and thus where I am registered to vote, holds their primary on February 3. And I should have requested my ballot by the end of December! I'll rush my request, and I guess I'll  have to inform myself and make up my mind after all... Dean or Clark or someone else? The last time I did this was in 1988 in the precinct caucuses in Minnesota. Back then I was a Jackson (as in Jesse) delegate. Times have changed.</p>
