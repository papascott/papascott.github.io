<p>I usually ignore award contests for weblogs, because 1) I believe that weblogs are an expressive medium solely motivated by personal satisfaction, and 2) I wouldn't win anyway. But I make exceptions for award contests that invite me to dinner.</p>
<p>Next Monday I'll be in Cologne attending a "press salon" held by <a title="The BOBs - BEST OF THE BLOGS - Deutsche Welle International Weblog Awards 2004" href="http://www.thebobs.de/bob.php?site=home">The Deutsche Welle International Weblog Awards</a> featuring a discussion on "Weblogs and Freedom of the Press" by Mu Zimei (China), Jörg Kantel (Germany) and Anton Nossik (Russia), and moderated by Konstantin Klein (Very Large Orange, and ex-German-expat). The salon will be "blogged live", which is where I come in. I imagine they will dress me in <a href="/archives/2004/09/12/a-guy-in-his-pajamas/">pajamas</a> and put me on display for the journalists in a golden cage hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p>I don't see any mention of the event at DW's website, so you'll have to take <a href="http://blog.schockwellenreiter.de/6707">Jörg's</a> and <a href="http://www.worldwideklein.de/index.php?/weblog/on-the-road-again/">Konstantin's</a> word for it that it is indeed taking place.</p>
