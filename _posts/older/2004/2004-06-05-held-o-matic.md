<p>If you can't tell from my post titles. I'm in a musical mood lately. When I started listening to <a href="/archives/2004/03/17/helden/" title="PapaScott: Helden">Wir Sind Helden</a>, I thought to myself that every line of their lyrics could be the tagline for a weblog. And now I've done it. My tagline is now a random Helden lyric. The script is literally 3 lines of PHP (stolen from the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cafelog/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/hello.php?rev=1.3&view=auto">Hello Dolly plugin </a>in WordPress), so I won't bother to repeat it here.</p>
<p><strong>Update 27 Sep 2004</strong> I've switched musical directions. The lyrics are now <a href="/archives/2004/09/26/wouldnt-it-be-nice/">Wouldn't It Be Nice by the Beach Boys</a>, but may return to the Helden in the future.</p>
