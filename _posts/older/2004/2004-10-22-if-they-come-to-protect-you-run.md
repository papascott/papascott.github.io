<p><a title="Shark Blog: Emergency Sex" href="http://www.usefulwork.com/shark/archives/002907.html#002907">Shark Blog</a> points to an <a title="The Seattle Times: U.N. peacekeeping failures chronicled in book" href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002069794_unbook22.html">article</a> on the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401352014">"Emergency Sex and Other Desperate Measures"</a>, chronicling UN peacekeeping failures. "If blue-helmeted U.N. peacekeepers show up in your town or village and offer to protect you, run. Or else get weapons. Your lives are worth so much less than theirs." I'll have to remember this next time someone here tells me the UN can and should solve the world's problems.</p>
