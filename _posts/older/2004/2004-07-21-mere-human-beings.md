<p>Maybe next year they could split the Tour de France into two events, one for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/21/sports/sportsspecial/21CND-TOUR.html?hp" title="The New York Times > Sports > Sports Special > Armstrong Wins Time Trial, Extending Lead">Lance Armstrong</a>, and the other for mere human beings. And maybe German television should be <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/0,1518,309824,00.html" title="Eklat im TV: Voigt im ZDF-Interview abgeschaltet - Sport - SPIEGEL ONLINE">banned</a> from both events, for forgetting it's a team contest, not the German(s) against the world. <strong>Update:</strong> See also <a href="http://www.eamonn.com/archives/001437.html#001437" title="Eamonn Fitzgerald's Rainy Day: Rum notions of free speech on the Rhine">Rainy Day</a>.</p>
