<p>Yes, there's an election going on today, but as I've written before, I'm not all that convinced it matters much who wins. However, at home we're concentrating more on the illness of Mama's 90-year-old aunt, who lives 90 minutes away in Schleswig-Holstein, but has no immediate family, leaving it to the niece and nephews to arrange all that needs arranging (at least until Mama leaves for Sydney on Thursday). My impression from home is that, when you're sick, elderly and publicly insured, the German medical system totally sucks. Totally.</p>
