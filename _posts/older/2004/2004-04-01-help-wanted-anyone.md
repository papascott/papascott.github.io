<p>The layoff reaper strikes again at my employer. Despite short time and a slight profit last year, our workforce will be 10% less as of June 30. Let me ask here on behalf of 2 soon-to-be ex-coworkers that if anyone needs a Lotus Notes Admin (willing to relocate) or a Win/Citrix/Linux Workstation Admin (in Hamburg), they can drop me a line.</p>
