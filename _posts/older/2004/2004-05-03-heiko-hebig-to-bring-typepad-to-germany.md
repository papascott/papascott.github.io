<p>While I was trying to sleep off my jet lag this afternoon, Heiko announced that he will be <a title="I am blogging this by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com" href="http://www.hebig.com/archives/002049.shtml">representing Six Apart in Germany</a> and helping to launch TypePad here. Is there <a href="http://nico.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=194">room</a> for two <a href="http://www.blogg.de">blogging</a> <a href="http://www.typepad.com">companies</a> in Hamburg, both seeking world domination?
