<p><a title="One State, Two State, Red State, Blue State" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/weekinreview/08zell.html?ex=1391576400&en=5a0729b3dc8ebe5f&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">One State, Two State, Red State, Blue State</a> I guess I missed this Republican are red, Democrats are blue meme. Here in Germany the parties have colors, too, but red is left. We have the red/green coalition, both Union parties are black, the Free Democrats are yellow (in color, not necessarily in courage), any far-right parties are brown, and the Democratic Socialists are red (in the "better dead than red" sense). Although now the CDU is trying to establish <a title="Christian Democratic Union of Germany (Germany)" href="http://flagspot.net/flags/de%7Dcdu.html">orange</a> as a marketing color, so much that they've even colored Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust's face <a title="Ole von Beust - aber wer ist auf dem Plakat? [Noch'n Blogg]" href="http://blogg.lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=21">orange</a> in his campaign posters. This is too confusing, and I'm color-blind anyway. Maybe it's best to stick to red and blue.</p>
