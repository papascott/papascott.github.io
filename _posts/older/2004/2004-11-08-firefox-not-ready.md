<p>Like <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/2004/11/08/firefox-09-forever/" title="">Susan</a>, I haven't been real happy lately with Firefox, which is supposed to release 1.0 tomorrow. The release candidates for the Mac have been somewhat stable, but are still worse than 0.9.x. And they stil render certain GIFs improperly, like PhotoMatt's header and the star images at Amazon, at least for me. And under Linux, Firefox chokes, and sometimes freezes, on mistyped hostnames with slow DNS lookups. Maybe it works better on Windows, but I fear the <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=node/view/4891">hype</a> is going to backfire. It's not ready.</p>
