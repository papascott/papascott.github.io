<p>It's now as good as official. With the new year I will be working as sys admin for New Media Management, part of the <a href="http://www.stroeer.com/">Ströer Gruppe</a> and parent company of <a href="http://www.blogg.de/">blogg.de</a>, working for and with <a title="Tschüß orangemedia.de! [Lummaland - das Weblog]" href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1062">Nico Lumma</a>. So it turns out that I am <a title="PapaScott: blogging can help smart people get jobs" href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/20/blogging-can-help-smart-people-get-jobs/">smart enough</a> after all to get a job because of my weblog. </p>
<p>Nico and I have been telling each other for over a year that "wouldn't it be cool if we could somehow work together", and I am very happy that it has now worked out. I am looking very forward to working with Nico and his crew (Hi Thorte! Hi NicoB!). I'll be able to work around Christopher's schedule, but I'm sure that <a title="Google Search: site:lumma.de Dönerstag" href="http://www.google.de/search?q=+site:lumma.de+D%C3%B6nerstag">Dönerstag</a>  (translation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebab">döner kebab</a> on Thursday) will become a regular part of my weekly plan.</p>
