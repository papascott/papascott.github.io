<p>My blog is schizophrenic, just like me. I sometimes blog about my family, sometimes about politics, sometimes about being an expat in a strange land, and sometimes about geeky computer stuff. Since the geeky computer stuff doesn't have much to do with the other stuff, and my mother doesn't really want to read the geeky stuff, I'm going to try putting it on a separate page called <a title="Posts not intended for my mother" href="https://www.papascott.de/tech.php">PapaTech</a>.    We'll see how that works.</p>
