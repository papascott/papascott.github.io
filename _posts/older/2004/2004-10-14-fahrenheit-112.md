<p>In a blatent attempt to influence the US Presidential election, the Michael Moore film Fahrenheit 9/11 <a title="Fahrenheit 9/11 im TV" href="http://ameisendorf.de/?itemid=88">will shown on television on Election Day</a>. German and Austrian televsion, that is (Pro7/Sat1 and ORF).</p>
<p>Except that Germans and Austrians can't vote in American elections. And US expat voters will have had to have sent in their absentee ballots long before the film is aired. So what's the point?</p>
<p>(Correction: the film will be shown on 1 November, not 2 November. The <a href="http://www.netzeitung.de/medien/309149.html">Netzitung article</a> thorte cited was unclearly worded.)</p>
