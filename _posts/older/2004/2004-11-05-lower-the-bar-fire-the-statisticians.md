<p>Remember the Lisbon Agenda, in which the EU pledged to become the world's most competitive economy by 2010? OK, stop laughing. Germany has come up with a plan on how the agenda can be met, namely by lowering the goal, a tactic which seems to work for domestic financial problems. So instead of competing right away with the United States, the EU can start by competing with, say, Khazakstan or Bangladesh. I personally think a better solution would be for the EU to hire <a href="http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/041021090354.2ted4mo5" title="EUbusiness - EU attacks Greece over dodgy data">Greek statisticians</a>. </p>
<p>Maybe the tactic can be applied to other issues as well, for example, Turkey. "Did you think we said talks would open in this century? No, we never meant that..."
