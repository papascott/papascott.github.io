<p><a title="Bjørn Stærk blog - Enough with the US election" href="http://blog.bearstrong.net/001470.html">Bjørn Stærk: Enough with the US election</a> "You get a sense of how intertwined European and American culture has<br />
become, and how much of a one-way relationship it is, when you look at<br />
the amount of press coverage the US election receives here. It may seem<br />
obvious to my American readers that their election should be covered in<br />
full detail all across the world, but it's not. You're not <i>that</i> important.  But we care anyway... On October 18, Norway's online newspapers published 52 articles mentioning John Kerry. On the same day, they published 18 articles mentioning our own prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik." It's just as bad in Germany.</p>
