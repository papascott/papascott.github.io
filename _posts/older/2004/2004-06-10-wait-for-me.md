<p>The Telekom (or as they call themselves these days, <a href="http://www.t-com.de">T-Com</a>) has scheduled our DSL connection to be activated on 21 June, approximately 11 weeks after my I submitted my order on 31 March. Good thing I didn't order something really rare and precious like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabant">Trabant</a>.</p>
