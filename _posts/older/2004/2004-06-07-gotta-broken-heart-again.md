<p>Is the sign of a good sysadmin that his network at home is a mess? Then I'm a good sysadmin. Up to now I've had 5 static addresses in my home network. In getting ready for DSL, I counted my current network devices and came up with 14. One router, one access point, 3 PCs, 3 notebooks, 2 with internal wifi ports, 3 wifi cards... wait, that's only 13. I'll have to do an nmap to find the last one. I'm not even counting cell phones with bluetooth. And Christopher doesn't have any devices of his own, yet.</p>
