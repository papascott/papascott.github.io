<p>If your wife keeps bugging you because she can't read her mail on Windows XP using iNotes with IE6 ("unable to process request"), <a title="Lotus Notes: Please help! 'Error encountered retriving data' error in some web clients!" href="http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:eJ8EiWP4cn8J:www.experts-exchange.com/Applications/Email/Lotus_Notes/Q_20846007.html inotes mail refresh error %22http 1.1%22&hl=en&ie=UTF-8">try</a> activating both boxes (use HTTP 1.1 / use HTTP 1.1 with proxy) under Internet Options -> Advanced -> HTTP 1.1 settings. Then maybe she can leave you alone</p>
