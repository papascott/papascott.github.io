<p>Christopher has always refused to wear jeans or canvas pants, preferring either overalls or (now that he can go to the toilet by himself) sweat pants. The average life expectancy of sweat pants for a 4 year old is about one week.... the weakest link is in the knees.</p>
<p>Then yesterday Mama started calling his tan canvas pants 'Janick pants', after his best friend Janick. This morning he requested the Janick pants by name. We're hoping to expand the brand  to include all colors and fabrics.</p>
