<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3880641.stm">BBC NEWS: German immigration bill approved</a>, but it's been in the conference committee for so long (5 years), I've forgotten what it's supposed to do. I do know that the current law (under which I obtained German residency) was signed by the Kaiser, so a reform is several decades overdue.</p>
