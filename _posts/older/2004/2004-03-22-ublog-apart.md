<p><a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/">Loïc Le Meur</a>, who was recently in Hamburg at our Blog Meet, has <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/03/six_apart_and_u.html" title="Loïc Le Meur Blog: Six Apart and Ublog SA sign an exclusive representation agreement in Europe">announced</a> that his company will be the exclusive partner of Six Apart in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa). And now we know why he came to Germany for a week... it wasn't just a whim. :-)</p>
<p>At the BlogMeet <a href="http://beissholz.de/">neezee</a> and I talked with him for a little bit how bloggers can bridge across countries despite language barriers, and how one blogs differently in a native language than in a learned language. I was impressed by him and his enthusiasm, and it will be good for us bloggers that Loïc and his company will be present in Germany. It will be good for the competition as well.</p>
