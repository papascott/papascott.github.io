<p>Compared to yesterday, my to-do list for today is a breeze.</p>
<p>1. Stumble on steps at S-Bahn station Sternschanze on the way to work and twist knee. Do not notice pain at first. When at noon walking becomes extremely uncomfortable, go home. Find that family doctor has no office hours this afternoon. Go to pharmacy and buy strongest non-prescription pain pills available. </p>
<p>**Update:** My neighbor the physical therapist says that the fibula *(Wadenbein)* is way too flexible at the knee, and suspects a severe strain or a minor tear. She suggests I visit an orthopedist first thing in the morning. And since this was legally a work accident, I get to become acquainted with German workers' comp bureaucracy. Oh, joy!</p>
