<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown" title="by John Gruber">Markdown</a> is a syntax for converting plain text to (X)HTML. It's written in Perl and available (among other things) as a <a href="http://www.movabletype.org" title="Movable Type">MT</a> plugin. I'm trying it out with this post. It's designed to leave the plain text very readable after it's marked up, as opposed to <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/" title="by Dean Allen">Textile</a>, which makes marking up plain text easy but is leaves the plain text less than readable. Markdown might come in handy for text maintained by less web-savvy colleagues, or for quickly marking up text from web-unfriendly sources (like Microsoft Word). I'll try it out for a few posts.</p>
<p>(The MTEntry tag <code>convert_breaks</code> seems to be incompatible with Markdown. I've removed it from my templates for now, and if I keep using Markdown I'll figure out another way to get my entry title and my permalink on the same line as the entry body.)</p>
