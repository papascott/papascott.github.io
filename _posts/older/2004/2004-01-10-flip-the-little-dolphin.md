<p>Yesterday Christopher picked out a <a title="Amazon.de: BÃ¼cher: Flip, der kleine Delphin" href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3551086516/qid=1073768033">picture book</a> from the <a href="http://www.carlsenkids.de/programm/lesemaus/">Carlsen 'Lesemaus' series</a>. It is  about a baby dolphin, including pictures of the dolphin being born and nursing. OK, we can handle questions about that. The birth isn't so interesting for Christopher yet, but he noticed the nursing. 'The baby dolphin is drinking, like I used to drink from Mama!' Is his memory really that good? Not really... when I read to him this evening, he said he used to drink from Papa. Mama could only laugh.</p>
