<p>We had our appointment today with the speech expert from Hannover. She approved Christopher the <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/05/19/kindergarten-watch/">speech therapy kindergarten</a> in Winsen, which was what we wanted. The costs will be split between the county and our health insurance. Now that the plans are concrete, I can make arrangements to work part-time starting in August and maybe do some free-lancing with the extra time I'll have at home. I'm happy that I won't be forced to leave work. </p>
<p>While Christopher is making improvements in areas like vocabulary, his fluency of speech <em>(Redefluss)</em> is still jerky, sometimes lapsing into stuttering.  It will be good for him to be in a small group of his peers. He won't be starting until fall, but the kindergarten has already invited us to their summer party this weekend. They are hoping for warm weather for water games.</p>
