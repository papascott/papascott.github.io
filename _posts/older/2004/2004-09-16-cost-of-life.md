<p>Just to put the current German debates on health care and education in perspective, Seth reports how <a href="http://www.sethb.com/weblog/archive/2004/09/iowa_college_pr.html" title="Seth-Tech: Iowa college prices draw F rating">tuition at public colleges in Iowa is up 71%</a> in five years. He also points to Tom and Dori, who <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/2004_09_12_archive.html#a004155">needed  individual health insurance</a> after having lost their coverage. They found a Health Savings Account plan, a creation of the Bush Administration, which is more expensive, gives worse coverage, and if widely adopted would erode the entire American health insurance system.</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
