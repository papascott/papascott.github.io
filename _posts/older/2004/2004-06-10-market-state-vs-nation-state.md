<p><a href="http://jrobb.mindplex.org/2004/06/10.html#a4888">John Robb:</a> (on the killing of 11 Chinese workers in Afghanistan) "This begs the question:  why are we using market-state techniques (like outsourcing work) in a location that needs nation-state development (ie. local work)?  This is the same mistake we continue to make in Iraq."</p>
