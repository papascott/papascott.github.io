<p>In Germany, Santa has a sidekick, the <em>Nikolaus</em>, who comes ahead of time and cases the joint for the big guy. As Mama was unpacking the Christmas decorations this evening, Christopher said the <em>Nikolaus</em> needs a horse and quickly drew and cut out this. And I had another one of those moments when realized my son is both more intelligent <em>and</em> more creative than I.</p>
