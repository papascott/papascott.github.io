<p>I've been playing with Net News Wire, and it seems to be as good as everyone says it is. It's the first desktop news aggregator I've tried that makes me feel like I want to keep using it. But it's still just a desktop aggregator... I can't use it at work, and it only works when the machine is turned on and connected.</p>
<p>Which got me thinking... wouldn't it be nice if news readers worked like IMAP mail clients? A server could collect the feeds and keep track of which items had been read, and I could use whatever reader I want from whatever machine I want. Just a thought...</p>
