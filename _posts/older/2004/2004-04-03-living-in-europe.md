<p>They took down the beta sign so now it must now be official. <a title="Living in Europe blogzine" href="http://www.livingineurope.net/">Living in Europe</a> "is a new community blogzine produced by a cooperative of bloggers and writers with a focus on ... <em>Living in Europe</em>." The concept (see Eammon's 4 part <a title="Eamonn Fitzgerald's Rainy Day: Preview: Interview with Michael Darragh" href="http://www.eamonn.com/archives/001278.html">interview</a>, in 5 parts) started last year with Living in China, and and is now also in Australia, India and Latin America. In Europe they have an intriguing idea to deal with languages... the main blog is in English, but there can be sub-categories for countries and regions (for example, <a title="Living in Catalonia" href="http://www.livingineurope.net/archives/cat_living_in_catalonia.html">Catalonia</a>) with posts various languages, so there can be some interaction between native and non-native writers. </p>
