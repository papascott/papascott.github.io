<p>I've done it. Encouraged among other things by a persistent comment spammer, I've now converted this blog to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> 1.2. At the same time, my permalinks are now cool hyphenated-titles-like-<a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/">Shelley</a>-and-<a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark</a>, so I must be cool now as well. Of course the old links are redirected... well, most of them anyway. And I wanted to redo the blogroll anyway, so that's missing for the moment. But otherwise things should pretty much look and work as before, unless you want to link a dozen times to a porn site in a comment. That won't work anymore.</p>
