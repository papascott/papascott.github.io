<p>I've been preoccupied this weekend by my wife's birthday celebration, work matters, hay fever, and Euro 2004, but I would be remiss not to mention <a href="http://wiki.blogg.de/BlogGrill">BlogGrill in Hamburg</a> last Thursday. I was there. I did man the grill for a time (after expressing doubt about the grilling skill of urban Germans and the equipment used). I did not introduce myself around, and thus missed half the people who were there. Next time we need name tags, maybe stickers that say "Hi, my URL is....".</p>
<p>The main impression I gained is that an amazing number of north German bloggers once worked for McDonald's.</p>
