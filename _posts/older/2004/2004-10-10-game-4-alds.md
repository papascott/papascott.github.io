<p>I actually stayed up and watched most of this game on the mlb.com video stream. As an afternoon game, it started at 10:30 pm German time, and I thought it might be my last chance to see Johan Santana pitch this year. Turned out I was right. Santana wasn't at his best, having had only 3 days rest, but had a few great moments. I didn't make it until the end, though. I went to bed at 2:30, after 10 innings, so I didn't see the bitter end. Sierra's tying home run in the 8th was bitter enough.</p>
