<p>We have new developments in the soap opera that is my workplace. Management finally presented a concrete proposal for salary reductions (retroactive to July 1). The reductions are to be progressive (rather than a flat 15%)  and require 75% acceptance to take effect. However, the reductions are still permanent and the employees still receive nothing in return... no layoff protection, no plan for future repayment, and no business plan for the future. So I'll vote to reject the plan. If that means layoffs, even for me, then so be it.</p>
<p>At the same time, I've decided to stay with the company (rather than work elsewhere or go freelance) at least until the end of the year. The exception would be if a <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">blogging</a> <a href="http://www.blogg.de">company</a> were interested in me, but otherwise I'll wait and see.</p>
