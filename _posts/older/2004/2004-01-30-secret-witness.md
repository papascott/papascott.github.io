<p>The supposed Iranian ex-agent Zakeri testified today in the Mzoudi terror trial, and was not very convincing, according to radio reports and <a title="Mzoudi-Prozess: Der Schuss ist nach hinten losgegangen - Panorama - SPIEGEL ONLINE" href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,284410,00.html">Spiegel Online</a>. Zakeri, who claims also to have worked for the CIA and the German BND, could only say that he heard from an unidentified Iranian official that Mzoudi was among the 9/11 plotters. Hearsay from an unreliable witness. Mzoudi is almost certain to acquitted when the verdict is announced, now scheduled for next Thursday, unless the prosecution finds another secret witness.</p>
