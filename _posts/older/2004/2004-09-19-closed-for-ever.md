<p>Is <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/newuser.mefi">MetaFilter permanently closed to new users?</a> I've been trying off and on for several months to sign up, and keep getting told that signups are closed.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this when I saw <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/003461.shtml" title="paradox1x: Johnny Ramone, Rest in peace">Karl's post on the death of Johnny Ramone</a>.</p>
