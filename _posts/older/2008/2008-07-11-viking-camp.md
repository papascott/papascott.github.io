<p>This weekend we'll be away in Cuxhaven for our annual camping trip with Christopher's uncles and cousins. We refer to it as <a href="http://home.arcor.de/wikingerlager.de/Org/Lager/Lager.htm">Viking Camp</a>, since the weather for our trips is always so frigid that only a Viking could feel at home. Well, at least one time it was. It looks like this time it will only be wet. We'll be back Sunday evening to wring ourselves out.</p>
