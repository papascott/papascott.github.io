<p>Remember the <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/07/04/coming-soon/">directional sign</a> we had made to motivate us on our way to work? This is how it looked this morning:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2324088120" title="View 'CIMG0750' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3291/2324088120_616aee574f.jpg" alt="CIMG0750" border="0" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>We also have 5 smaller signs directing drivers to our restaurant. All of them were similarly defaced, so this was no random act of vandalism. Yes, the signs are insured, but a lot of time and energy is wasted to report to the police, file an insurance claim, and arrange for repair or replacement.</p>
