<p>Since the Expat Meetup in Bremen we know the number one tourist attraction, so when Christopher and I were in town for business at the US Consulate, we made sure to stop by.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we weren't able to renew Christopher's passport as planned. The US State Department has tightened the rules on parental consent, and both parents must sign the application in person. A notarized consent form is no longer accepted unless it is physically impossible for the parent to appear. "In prison" was the example we were given. "Being a busy businesswoman" doesn't cut it. Luckily Christopher has a understanding if busy mother, so Christopher's application will have the missing signature within a few days.</p>
<p>The information on <a href="http://germany.usembassy.gov/germany/services/passport_issuance.html">germany.usembassy.gov</a> is somewhat confusing on this point, but now that I've given my constructive feedback, I'm sure they'll get the details fixed soon. :-)</p>
