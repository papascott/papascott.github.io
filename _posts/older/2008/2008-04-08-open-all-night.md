<p>Staying open 24 hours is an idea we briefly considered but then rejected... the night traffic at our restaurant is just too light. So we close the drive-thru at 1 during the week and at 4 on weekends. But now our restaurant manager has convinced us that on weekends the potential is there, and presented us with a staffing concept to stay open all night Friday and Saturday with no additional labor costs. So we're going for it! Starting the first weekend in May, our drive-thru will stay open all night on Friday and Saturday. Even if we only break even, the advertising potential will be worth the effort</p>
