<p>My Text Link Ads are booked out again, so I guess the reports that changes in Google had killed such advertising were greatly exaggerated. PayPal has already sent a notice that my balance is too high for personal use.</p>
<p>Earning money from ads on PapaScott reminds me of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-M3Q2zhGd4">Woody Allen joke</a> about his brother who thought he was a chicken. "Yes, we know we should take him to a psychiatrist, but we need the eggs."</p>
