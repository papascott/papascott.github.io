<p>Frauke had surgery on her right hand last week for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_Tunnel_Syndrome">Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</a>. Her arm had been bothering her for a couple of months, with numbness and pins-and-needles feeling at night. After some unsuccessful local treatments, our orthopedist sent her to a neurologist who confirmed that the median nerve was indeed being pinched and that surgery would be the best option.</p>
<p>Our orthopedist also performed the surgery, and she's been back 3 times already for follow-up. Her right hand is still in a splint, but she was back at work the afternoon on the surgery. She says she can make a lot on add-on sales in McCaf&eacute; based on sympathy. She can't drive her Touran because of the manual transmission, but has traded cars with an employee so she remains mobile.</p>
<p>Her hand is doing fine and is recovering on schedule. Her frustration with having to do everything left-handed is what one would expect, and we're confident that her disposition will also recover on schedule.</p>
