<p>German Joys (responding to the Spiegel article last week on <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,567038,00.html">Beta Bloggers</a>) on why <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2008/07/internet-die-beta-blogger---netzwelt---spiegel-online---nachrichten.html">Germans are such poor bloggers</a>. Point 1:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. A national culture of modesty that frowns upon too much self-expression. Americans have the advantage here. They're hardly afraid of looking like fools, and like to talk about themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://lumma.de/">Herr Lumma</a> will be interested in point 4:</p>
<blockquote><p>4. Germany's hierarchical, party-driven, elite-dominated political structure doesn't foster the belief that ordinary citizens can meaningfully change government policies ... there is no critical mass of people who consider the Internet a tool for positive <em>political mobilization</em> (rather than ranting), [thus] there is no real incentive to try to form mass movements or raise large amounts of money on-line</p></blockquote>
<p>As for me, I'll try to take point 1 more to heart and play the fool here more often.</p>
