<p>Even after 18 years of driving in Germany, I still have problems following my instincts with right of way at intersections.</p>
<p>The German rule is <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorfahrtsregel"><em>Rechts vor Links</em></a>, or right before left. That's the same as I learned in driver's training in Minnesota. In the words of the <a href="http://www.dps.state.mn.us/dvs/DLTraining/DLManual/DLManual.htm">Minnesota Driver's Manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When two vehicles reach an intersection at the same time, and there is no traffic light or signal, the driver of the vehicle on the left must yield to the vehicle on the right.</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, so good. But at T-intersections, a different rule applies:</p>
<blockquote><p>When two vehicles approach an uncontrolled &ldquo;T&rdquo; intersection, the driver of the vehicle that is turning must yield to all cross traffic.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/100px-zeichen-306svg.png" alt="100px-Zeichen_306.svg.png" border="0" width="100" height="100" align="right" />In other words, straight before turns. In Germany this doesn't apply. "Right before left" applies to <a href="http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stvo/__8.html">both T- and regular intersections</a>. When a cowpath adjoins a highway, traffic from the highway must yield to traffic from the right on the cowpath unless right-of-way is posted on the highway with a <em>Vorfahrtstra&szlig;e</em> sign. Ninety percent of T-intersections have such a sign.</p>
<p>It's at the T-intersections that aren't posted where I have problems. I consciously think "This is a T-intersection, I can't follow my instincts", and I end up yielding to everybody.</p>
<p>This drives my wife nuts, but I suspect that if it's gone on this long, I'll never outgrow it.</p>
