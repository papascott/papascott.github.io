<p>We haven't made any progress on the house pet front, but the ongoing negotiations are encouraging. We do have some further details on why Christopher is insisting on a dalmatian.</p>
<p>>Mama: What about a beagle. They're cute and have such floppy ears.</p>
<p>>Christopher: But beagles are brown. I want a dalmatian that's black and white. Black and white are my favorite colors.</p>
<p>>Mama: Why is that?</p>
<p>>Christopher: Black is in the German flag and white is in the American flag. So a dalmatian is German and American, just like me.</p>
<p>Can't argue with that logic.</p>
