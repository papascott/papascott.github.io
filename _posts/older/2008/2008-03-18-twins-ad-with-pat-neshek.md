<p>Twins pitcher and Minnesota native Pat Neshek has been keeping a <a href="http://patneshek.com/">weblog</a> since he was in the minors. It's now spring training and Pat will be starting his second full year in the major leagues. The Twins now figure that Pat is well known enough to star in his own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6pYVNxJQI">TV ad</a> for the team. Well, maybe he's not as well known as they thought...</p>

<p>Pat himself <a href="http://eteamz.active.com/PatNeshek/#news4228830">blogged about the spot</a> (but click fast, his hoster hasn't implemented permalinks), and if you're not from Minnesota you might need to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=joe+mauer+sideburns">Google</a> to get the bit about the sideburns. All of the Twins TV ads are pretty good... the best one was last year with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7G3OtU6OkQ">Johan Santana/Joe Nathan carpool</a>.</p>
