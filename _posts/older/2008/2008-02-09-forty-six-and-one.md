<p>Happy Birthday to Me! I turn forty-six today, and I started the day by working the closing shift in the restaurant last night, getting home at 5:30. It was a good shift despite being one closer short.</p>
<p>It was also one year ago today that Frauke returned from one of her many business trips to Munich to tell that that she'd be given the opportunity to become a franchisee, and would be home a lot more in the future.</p>
