<p>The first rule of cash security is "you don't talk about cash security". But starting today we're having an armored car pick up our receipts, since with multiple locations it makes no sense to deposit cash ourselves. Now I can finally say what I hate most about my job.</p>
<p>I HATE MAKING BANK DEPOSITS!!! IT TAKES AN HOUR FROM MY LIFE EVERY DAY!!!!</p>
