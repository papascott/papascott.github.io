<p>My brother is fully awake now and has been moved to the telemetry ward and is no longer in intensive care. Telemetry means in this case he's attached to the monitors via WLAN instead of being hard-wired, or something like that. He'll have a second stent put in on Monday and is scheduled to be discharged on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As for me, I've booked a return flight to be back home Tuesday evening, just in time for report-card school vacation that starts on Wednesday. Thanks again for all the support online.</p>
