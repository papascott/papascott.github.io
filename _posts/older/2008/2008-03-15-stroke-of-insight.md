<p><a href="http://vowe.net/archives/009271.html">Vowe recommended</a> watching the video <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/229">Stroke of Insight</a> and it was a very fascinating 19 minutes.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor had an opportunity few brain scientists would wish for: One morning, she realized she was having a massive stroke. As it happened -- as she felt her brain functions slip away one by one, speech, movement, understanding -- she studied and remembered every moment. This is a powerful story about how our brains define us and connect us to the world and to one another.
