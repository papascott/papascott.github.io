<p>As <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2008/01/the-more-jobs-y.html">German Joys states</a>, the following <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/01/16/bachmann-jobs/">quote from Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN)</a> wouldn't fit anywhere in German politics:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I am so proud to be from the state of Minnesota. We&rsquo;re the workingest state in the country, and the reason why we are, we have more people that are working longer hours, we have people that are working two jobs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>(unless you mean by creating jobs you're creating more jobs per person).</p>
