<p>I haven't blogged much about this year's presidential campaign. But I'm going to put my money where my mouth is.</p>
<p>I've just donated one month's advertising proceeds from PapaScott to the <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">Obama</a> campaign. My Text Link Ads are fully booked, so it's not an insignificant amount.</p>
<p>However, it's not as significant as a single vote. If you are eligible to vote in this election, please do so.</p>
