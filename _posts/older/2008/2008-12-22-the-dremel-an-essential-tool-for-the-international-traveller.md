<p>Left: Original Travel Adapter with safety tabs (left and right) to prevent use with grounded plugs</p>
<p>Middle: Modified Travel Adapter with safety tabs removed (using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dremel">Dremel</a>)</p>
<p>Right: A grounded plug that can now be inserted into the modified adapter</p>
<p>Note: Use of the modified adapter is not recommended with any essential equipment you don't want to see fried. But any equipment you bring on a trip isn't essential anyway.</p>
