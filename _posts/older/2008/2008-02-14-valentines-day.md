<p>The rest of the world may be celebrating Valentine's Day today, but we're so busy with the business (German joke: "Selbstst&auml;ndig bedeutet immer selbst und st&auml;ndig") we don't really have time. But considering that we've been together since sometime around Valentine's Day in 1980 (that's so long ago, that Jimmy Carter was President and Helmut Schmidt was Chancellor), a 20 year franchise contract pales in comparison.</p>
<p>Actually we first met the November before, but the male half was too dense to notice that it could become anything permanent.</p>
