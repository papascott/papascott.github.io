<p>Boing Boing Gadgets mentions the upcoming LEGO Indiana Jones video game and how (like the toys) it <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/02/08/lego-indiana-jones-v.html">will not display Nazi symbols</a>. Good thing! As I mention in a <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/02/08/lego-indiana-jones-v.html#comment-121962">comment</a>, we already had to have a talk with Christopher about the Nazi symbols in the films.  He's going have to deal with German history soon enough... he should be able to have fun with LEGO without having to be confronted with the symbols already.</p>
<p>Of course it goes without saying that without the evil marketing geniuses at LEGO releasing toys and games in advance of the upcoming movie, Christopher wouldn't know about Indiana Jones at all, and it wouldn't be an issue.</p>
