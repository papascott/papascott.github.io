<p>The diagnosis is not yet final, but it appears that the battery on our E-Smart has died and needs replacement. A new battery costs 17,000Â€. We have pre-release model with a special leasing arrangement with Daimler, and we're assuming they won't bear the repair cost and will cancel our lease.</p>
<p>On the one hand that's too bad, since we're convinced of the utility of electric mobility, even in rural areas where we are, when one is aware of the limitations (120 km range, top speed 100 km/h). The E-Smart was effectively our second car, and in over 2 years there was only one occasion where we both needed a car with longer range on the same day. As long as we charged it in our carport every night, it met our needs. And even at German prices, electricity is 50% cheaper per km than gas or diesel.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was a pre-release model and it seemed to have pre-release bugs (e.g. the battery was never able to quick-charge as advertised). Plus the nearest service center is in Hamburg-Wandsbek, which is extremely inconvenient for us (45 minute drive into the city). And lately Daimler doesn't seem to know who is responsible for our contract... our inquiries would be transferred from Hamburg to Berlin to Stuttgart and back again.</p>
