I'm typing this bit with the new Mozilla M13 under Linux. This Mozilla seems usable! <i>Or am I just tired of Netscape "kill -9" Communicator 4?</i> Even the highly styled <a href="http://array.editthispage.com">array</a> looks almost like it's supposed to. <i>Netscape under Linux is a style killer!<br />
