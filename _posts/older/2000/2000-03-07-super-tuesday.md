<p>I hope either McCain or Bradley stays in the race. I have to pay big bucks for postage to send in an absentee ballot, but Gore vs Bush is not worth the bother of licking the stamp.</p>
<p>We had a tough weekend. Our neighbor Walter turned 70 on Saturday, with dinner and coffee starting at 11 am at the fire hall in LÃ¼llau. And the schnaps started flowing before noon. Then on Sunday we had a combined February birthday for me, Mama's brother and his 5-year-old daughter. Highlight was hearing her sing along to the new <a href="http://www.tomjones.com">Tom Jones</a> single: <a href="http://www.v2music.com/Scripts/WebObjects-ISAPI.dll/V2_New_Publisher.woa/74892000002661200000629520000025733/TomJonesReleaseIndex.wo/018020000006733/0.3.0/1/Webobjects1">Sex Bomb</a>!</p>
<p>Christopher came through the weekend in much better shape than Mama and I!</p>
