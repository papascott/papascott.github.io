<p>Today we took Christopher swimming for the first time. Mama's sister-in-law recommended the indoor pool in Schneverdingen, that has a wading pool set aside for parents and babies. It's also closer and cheaper than the pools in Hamburg.</p>

<p>We were pretty tired afterwards.</p>

<p>In fact, this afternoon both wife and child are sound asleep. Mama claimed that I was snoring too loud for her to sleep well last night, but I didn't hear a thing!</p>
