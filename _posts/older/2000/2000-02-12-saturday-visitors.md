<p>Christopher received visitors today.</p>
<p>The first was a surprise. Hermann from the farmplace across the road stopped by. He originally owned the land where our house now stands. </p>
<p>In the evening 2 friends of Mama's came by for <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/1999/12/24#raclette">raclette</a>. Christopher was the perfect host. He slept during our meal, and politely took his meal later.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/6986/yahoobsd.htm">Why Yahoo uses FreeBSD</a> I just got the 3.4 CDs to try out. <i>Follow up: it worked... I'm posting this under FreeBSD.</i></p>
<p>Today's <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de">Hamburger Abendblatt</a>, citing Psychologie Heute: The Exotic Germans "During his visit to Germany, Flavien Ndonko from Uganda was shocked to see a woman kissing a dog." <i>I can't even find a German link to this story, though, much less an English one!</i></p>
