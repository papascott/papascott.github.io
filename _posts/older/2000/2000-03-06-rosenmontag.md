<p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/03/05">Scripting News</a>:  "Cafe Boronne in Menlo Park is a European type hangout place smack in the middle of Silicon Valley." But the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$448">picture</a> doesn't look like any hangout I've seen in Europe. </p>
<p>I've become jaded. For me, a European cafe is a tiny <A HREF=http://www.tchibo.dTchibo coffee counter. You see them on every corner, and they all look alike. No place to sit... no chairs at all. Stay standing, drink your coffee in 5 minutes (no food served) and leave. </p>
<p>(If you folow the link, you'll see Tchibo looks more like a fashion catalog than a coffee company. They make more profit at their coffee shops from clothes than from coffee, since the discount store <a href="http://www.aldi.de">Aldi</a> has ruined the coffee market. Tchibo mentions coffee on their web page only as an afterthought.)</p>
