<p>Finally, a movie for which the German title is better than the original. Usually, the translations are pretty 'd√§mlich'. But 'Chicken Run' is in German is 'Hennen Rennen'. <i>Genial!</i></p>
<p>When I first came to Germany, it bothered me that all the imported movies were dubbed, rather than subtitled as in the States. Even when I didn't understand the language, I thought I could pick things up from hearing the original voices. Then I saw my first German-dubbed American movie, Pretty Woman, and I realized that for the vast majority of movies it doesn't make any difference. Junk is junk in any language. <i>Schrott bleibt Schrott!</i></p>
