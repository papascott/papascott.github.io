<p>I managed to break my Internet server so that I can no longer log in over the network. Since it is in Maryland and I am in Germany, it is a bit inpractical for me to log in directly! So until my hosting service can help me out, the <a href="http://www.mausnews.de">Maus Newsletter</a> is down, and E-mail sent to shcon.con or mausnews.de isn't being delivered. In the meantime, we can be reached at <a href="mailto:shanson@freenet.de">shanson@freenet.de</a> <b>Update Sunday 9 Jan 4 pm</b> The machine is back up! I'll slowly get everything running again.</p>
