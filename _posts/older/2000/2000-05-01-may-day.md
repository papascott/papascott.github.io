<p>We discovered a new walking trail today... a secret path through a cow pasture to a foot bridge connecting Thelstorf and Weihe across the Seeve creek. The 90 minute round is almost all paved, good for pushing the baby carriage! Of course we did not have the camera along. </p>
<p>Mama is feeding <a href="http://www.biobest.be/eng/EHeterorhabditis.htm">nematodes</a> to her rhododendrons. Or is she feeding the rhodos to the nematodes?</p>
<p>Today Christopher's cousins Lennart and Mareike bicyled to LÃ¼llau to pay us a visit.</p>
