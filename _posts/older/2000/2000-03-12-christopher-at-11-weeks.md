<p>It's the usual story. It's the weekend, and Christopher is in a much better mood than either of us. It's 8:30am, he's just had breakfast, and he's babbling and gurgling happily at his Fisher Price Teddy Bear mobile. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/crh.jpg" height="90" width="87" align="right" /> He laughs and smiles (toothlessly) at everything he sees. When he's especially pleased, he goes into a 'full body smile', in which he throws back his head, waves his arms, and kicks up his legs. </p>
<p>He's always slept well during the night, 4 hours at a stretch, but the last two nights he's slept through from 11pm to 5am. We're hoping that's a new trend.</p>
