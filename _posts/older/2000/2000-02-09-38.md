<p>Today was my birthday! I didn't sit on my computer at home at all.</p>
<p>On the the radio (<a href="http://www.ndr4.de">NDR4</a>), I heard that today is also the birthday of the Booker Prize author J.M. Coetzee. <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/1999/11/05/coetzee/">Salon on "Disgrace"</a>.</p>
<p>CNNSI: <a href="http://cnnsi.com/soccer/world/news/2000/02/09/german_roundup_ap/index.html">Bayern wins showdown of top Bundesliga clubs</a> Hamburg wins in Stuttgart to stay 5 pts behind in 3rd place.</p>
