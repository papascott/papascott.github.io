<p><a href="http://www.mopo.de/seiten/20000527/sport-artikel19.html">Miracle in St. Pauli</a> (Hamburger Morgenpost, in German). Forget the boring Bundesliga (Munich won the title again, HSV was 3rd). In the last game of the season Hamburg's 2nd League team <a href="http://www.fcstpauli.de/umkleide/main.asp">FC St. Pauli</a> scored in the 90th minute to tie and saved themselves from demotion. (I was going to say that FC St. Pauli is Germany's version of the <a href="http://www.cubs.de">Chicago Cubs</a>, but <a href="http://davespicks.com/">Dave 's Picks</a> reminded me of a better match: the <a href="http://www.spsaints.com/">St. Paul Saints</a>. The stadium, by the way,  is across the street from <a href="http://www.stadtplandienst.de/query;ORT=hh;LL=9.970093x53.552014;GR=3">my new office</a>.)</p>
