<p>Hey... I've got it, and I'm writing this with "Pike". This is cool! Mama was just complaining today how hard it is to edit her page with the browser. (But I had to dial-in under Windows to get it to work, since my Linux router acts like a firewall. Guess I have to read up on port forwarding with IP masquarading....)</p>
<p>It's quarter past 10 Pacific time... where's Pike? ";->" (10:40... ah, <a href="http://pikebeta.userland.com">here</a> it is!)</p>
<p>Yahoo Deutschland: <a href="http://de.sports.yahoo.com/000325/6/no1z.html">HSV auf Kurs in die Champions League</a>:  3rd place Hamburg defeats 4th place 1860 Munich 2-0 at home to move 8 points ahead. HSV is now 6 points behind frontrunners Bayern Munich and Leverkusen, who both managed just ties.</p>
