<p>New Page <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$111">Pictures of Christopher</a>: a list of links for those who can't get enough</p>
<p>John VanDyk, <a href="http://vfih.editthispage.com/2000/01/23">Those dumb farmers</a>: In school, you had the townies and the farm kids. The townies may have had the edge when it came to spelling or math, but the farm kids had the claim to practicality....on the whole, the farm kids had more common sense. <i>Sounds like where I grew up. I was a town kid.</i></p>
<p>Christopher's big test today was a visit to Mama's office. It sounds like he won them all over. But as I came home from work, she was on the phone with one of her colleagues talking company politics. <i>Her heart's at home, but her head's still in it!</i></p>
