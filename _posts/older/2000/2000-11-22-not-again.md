<p>After a high fever over the weekend, we thought Christopher was over it on Monday. But he isn't. He's got an ear infection, so it's back on antibiotics, and no play groups for a week. But he doesn't look or act sick, and his appetite is good.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is just another work day for me, but Christopher will be celebrating with a toddler-sized jar of <a href="http://www.hipp.de">Hipp</a> turkey and vegetables!</p>
<p>In our excitement of staying-home-while-Mom's-on-a-business-trip, we forgot to put out the trash on Monday night. That's bad. Our only trashbin is plump full of diapers, and the next pick-up is in two weeks.</p>
