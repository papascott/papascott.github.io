<p>Happy Birthday to my younger brother Steve in Montevideo, Minnesota. Hey, we though we could catch you yesterday during the Vikings game, but you were just pulling out of the driveway as we called!</p>

<p>Fittingly, the first baby of the new year in Hamburg was born to Turkish parents. Baby Izzmet is the first foreign child born in Hamburg to automatically gain German citizenship, under the new naturalization law that took effect on 1 January.</p>
