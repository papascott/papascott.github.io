<p>Time to catch up</p>
<p><b>Das Spiel ist aus!</b> In Euro 2000, Germany lost their final group game to Portugal 3-0 on Tuesday. They finished last in the group with no wins, and have gone home. The last time Germany finished a major tournement without a win was in 1938. As would be expected in a country where arrogance is a national attribute, the media is treating this as a major disaster. </p>
<p><b>Shopping trip</b> Highlight of the day today was a trip to Lüneburg to the Baby One shop to look for a crib and a baby phone. We would have bought the crib, they don't deliver, and to fit the crib in the Fiat one of us would have had to stay in Lüneburg.</p>
<p><b>It's Official</b> We'll be flying to the States for three weeks this fall to visit friends and family. We'll be in Arizona Sep 27 to Oct 3, then in Minnesota until Oct 17.</p>
