<p>We made it to Christopher's Grandma and Grandpa in Minnesota, where he doesn't need his shades anymore. We went from 38&deg;C in Phoenix to 4&deg;C here. We might even see snow tonight.</p>
<p>After working a week with modems on borrowed computers, I miss my German ISDN line. I especially miss not having to share a computer with Mama (what, she wants to check her stocks again?!?).</p>
<p>We've been trying to collect our thoughts about comparing life in Germany and in the US, since my father signed us on to do a presentation for his Kiwanis club next Monday. My first impression: the US has changed a lot less than Germany has since I've moved.</p>
