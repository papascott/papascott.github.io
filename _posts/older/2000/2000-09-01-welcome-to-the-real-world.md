<p>A hearty welcome to the world to <a href="http://traumwind.editthispage.com/2000/09/01">Raphael Nicolaj Spernau</a>, the latest editthispage baby! </p>
<p><b>Cut off!</b> Our flatrate Internet provider has closed all accounts and filed for bankruptcy! Good thing we only had one month left on our prepaid account. I think we'll switch to the <a href="http://www.dtag.de">Deutsche Telecom-edians</a>, er, I mean <a href="http://www.t-online.com">T-Offline</a>. They now offer a flatrate of their own, and they won't be going broke any time soon. And maybe someday they'll offer T-DSL in backwoods places like LÃ¼llau. (And maybe someday will be March 2001....)</p>
