<p>Friday morning. Christopher has just had breakfast, but I haven't.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.montechamber.com/pwaters/lqpwma.htm"><img src="/images/mausnews/geese.jpg" align="right" border="0" /></a> When Dave talks about his <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/pictures/viewer$483">honkers</a> on "Scripting News", I can't help but think of the <a href="http://www.montechamber.com/pwaters/lqpwma.htm">Lac qui Parle Wildlife Management Area</a>, near where I grew up in Minnesota. Every fall 150,000 Canadian 'honkers' stop here on their way south. <i>It's loud!</i></p>
<p>Susan has some pictures of <a href="http://2020hindsight.editthispage.com/2000/03/23">The Oldest Operating McDonald's</a></p>
<p>View from an Iowa Homestead: John says <a href="http://vfih.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$149"> Thanks Andrea and Andre</a> for a delivery of German chocolate. <i>Reminds of of the Care packages of coffee and chocolate we used to get from Mama's folks when we were in the States.</i></p>
<p>I can't think of any American goodies that I crave. Guess I've been gone too long!</p>
