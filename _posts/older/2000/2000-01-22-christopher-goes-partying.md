<p>Note the wardrobe composed in primary colors so that color-blind Papa can recognize his son's clothes.</p>
<p>Christopher is going to his first party this evening. Anke from work moved out of the city to the country near us last November, and is having a combination birthday/housewarming party. Mama said that Christopher travelled so well yesterday (visiting and shopping), that we could put in a brief appearance</p>
<p>Starting today, we have something at home that folks in the US take for granted: flatrate Internet access. Up to now we've always had to pay for the local phone call, 3 to 6 pfennigs per minute. Now there are flatrates available nationwide for around DM 150 a month.</p>
