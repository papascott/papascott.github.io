<p>Our big projects for today include getting some mole repellent for our friends in the back yard. Here you can see the path they are taking towards our patio.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scriping.com">Dave Winer</a> gives us a glimpse of what it's like at the <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2000/01/29/twoDaysAtDavos">World Economic Forum in Davos</a></p>
