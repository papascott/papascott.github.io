<p>From <a href="http://www.internetworld.de/index_1711.html">internetworld.de</a>: Haider's party web site faked! http://www.fpo.at (<a href="http://www.fpo.at/englisch/welcome.html">English start page</a>) The fake partner site http://www.ovp.at is 'closed due to takeover' and redirected to fpo.at! (The rl sites of the FPÖ and ÖVP are http://www.fpoe.at and http://www.oevp.at, but non-German speakers wouldn't think of adding the extra 'e'.)</p>
<p>Ack! We just noticed at 9pm that out combination furnace/water heater has gone out! Mama had noticed a funny smell this afternoon and had turned the thermostat to off. Now it won't come back on. <i>Time to call an expert... niether of us can even read the manual!</i></p>
<p>Don't worry, Christopher shares his space heater with us.</p>
