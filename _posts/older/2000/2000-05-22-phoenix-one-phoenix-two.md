<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/2000/05/22">Andrea's Weblog</a>:  "Where do you want to live?  <a href="http://www.stormwerks.com/linked/2000_05_14_archive.html#245935">Zannah</a> had this link to a test where you can <a href="http://homes.wsj.com/d/best.html">find the best place for you to live</a>. (Only places in the USA are available, I think.)"</p>
<p>I tried it out, and our last home in the US, Phoenix, came out on top. Of course, I deliberately manipulated my answers so that it would (desert climate and low taxes very important, ignore education and culture, but national parks are OK).</p>
