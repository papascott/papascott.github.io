<p>I'm doing way too much. Overtime at work... we're launching our main site at the end of the month, I need to put together a quick bug database for Hanover 'by yesterday', and Leipzig needshelp importing a banking frontend into Lotus Notes. And I should really help Singapore for a few days, but don't know when or if I can fit it in. </p>
<p>And of course, there is the small matter of a wife and son at home that are much more important than anything at work and need daily attention. So the weblog is suffering. So it goes.</p>

The sunken Russian submarine</a> is the main story here, with special reports after the Tagesschau. I suffered extreme claustrophobia just from reading the submarine scenes in <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/">Cryptonomicon</a>.</p>
