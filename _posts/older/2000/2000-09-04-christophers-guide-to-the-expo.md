<p>I went to the Expo expecting to be cynical. Corporate glossy visions<br />
of the future... you can already get that at Disneyland, right?<br />
Thankfully, my expectations were not met. We arrived early, stayed<br />
late, did not exhaust or bankrupt ourselves, and had a good time. We<br />
didn't plan a strategy ahead of time, but looking back, our plan was:</p>
<p>* Avoid the long lines. There are about 10 major attractions with long<br />
lines, and we skipped most of them. There are hundreds of things to see<br />
without any line at all. The most spectacular attraction, the 21st<br />
Century, has the longest line. If we go again, we'll to rush there<br />
right at opening time. Hopefully it won't rain next time.</p>
<p>* Baby carriage accessible? Mostly. We were scared from the lofty<br />
Holland pavillion by both the line and the many stairs, but most of<br />
the halls are handicapped accessible. We carried Christopher into<br />
several smaller exhibits.</p>
<p>* Lots of rest stops. Christopher was often hungry, thirsty, tired, or<br />
needed changing. Don't rush, stay flexible?</p>
<p>* Hungry? Use connections if you got them (Mama's employer is a<br />
sponsoring partner of the Expo), or go ethnic. The country booths have<br />
better and cheaper food than the stands outside.</p>
<p>* Avoid the propaganda. Concentrate on the country booths. </p>
<p>What did we see? A rather large country in North America was not<br />
represented at all, but we did see Sri Lanka, Australia, Andorra,<br />
Israel, Egypt, Malta, Luxembourg, France, United Arab Emeriates,<br />
Latvia, Lithuania, United Kingdom, Norway, Brazil, Canada, Iceland<br />
(fron the outside) and Vietnam (for dinner).</p>
<p>My highlight? Germany.  The pavillion was lavish, well thought out, planned to the last detail, and<br />
maybe too perfect, but showed a happy, thoughtful ,prosperous and<br />
diverse country that Germany could become. As someone who lives here<br />
by choice, I hope that's the direction it will really go.</p>
<p><i><b>One thought I couldn't get out of my mind for a long time last night was "Why is Germany hosting the EXPO 2000 and therefore the world and can't control the problems with right-wing extremism"??? I'm ashamed to read headlines like this on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/09/02/german.neo/index.html">CNN</a>! How many citizens and government officials have looked the other way for years to have come to accept a sort of nationalist sentiment in some Germans! </p>
<p>I'm very much ashamed of my fellow citizens who are disoriented in their way of thinking. 21 years ago I was an AFS High School Exchange Student in the US and I frequently dealt with questions about the "German  Conscience" in relation to the Holocaust. I never thought Right Wing Nationalists would be marching in Germany ever again. </p>
<p>Suddenly politicians are thinking what can be done to stop this mental disease. I like a proposal from the Socialdemocrat Party: if convicted of right-wing activities your driver's license may be revoked for a minimum of 10 years. That just might be an effective way to give some disoriented young people a moment to think about what they might be about to do!</b></i></p>
