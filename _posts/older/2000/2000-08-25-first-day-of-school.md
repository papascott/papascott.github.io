<p>Mama's nephew (and godson) Lennart starts first grade tomorrow. In Germany, starting first grade is a Very Big Deal, the first step in coming-of-age. The new <i>ABC Schutzen</i> (ABC shooters) are celebrated with a <i>Schult√ºte</i> full of candy and goodies, a brand new school bag (<a href="http://www.der-echte-scout.de">name brands</a> start at DM 150), and a party for selected relatives and guests.</p>
<p>Lennart's school has thoughtfully made the first day a Saturday, so that the selected relatives and guests have no excuse not to participate. The festivities begin with a church service at 9 am, and continue through to the obligatory coffee and cake in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>The net result is that even the not-so-interested spouse of the godmother has to block out an entire Saturday from his calendar.</p>
<p>When I started first grade, I might have gotten an apple, but probably not. I think my mother was just happy to finally have me out of her hair for the whole day. </p>
<p>German elementary schools are only half day, by the way. That makes life complicated or working parents.</p>
