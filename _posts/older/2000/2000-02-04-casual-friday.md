<p>Jim Roepcke: <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/2000/02/02">Casual Friday for the telecommuter</a> (via <a href="http://carpediem.editthispage.com/">carpediem</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20000204/bs/europe_telecom_takeover_22.html">Mannesmann, Vodafone Set To Merge</a> </p>
<p>New York Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/late/04austria.html">Haider's Party Sworn Into New Austrian Government</a> "(T)he icy manner and averted gaze of President Thomas Klestil conveyed all his personal distaste for the intermittently hate-mongering politics of Mr. Haider's rightist party" </p>
<p>Christopher passed his "U3", the third of a series of 10 required medical examinations for all pre-school children in Germany (the first two were at the hospital). Mama was very happy with the "Kinderarzt" (pediatrician).</p>
<p>Christopher has been cranky the past couple of nights, though. Maybe the honeymoon is over?</p>
