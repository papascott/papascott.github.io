<p>I've been filling out the playlist at <a href="http://www.live365.com/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?genre=search&searchdesc=papascott&autostart=papascott">PapaScott Radio</a>. I'm up to 10 songs. I'm not quite legal for continuous play yet, since songs shouldn't repeat more often than 3 hours, and I haven't uploaded that much yet. Also, to be legal one cannot publish the playlist.</p>
<p>My taste is somewhat Modern Mainstream, half German / half English.</p>
<p>I'm using the EasyCast feature at Live365. Just upload the mp3 files and play. I'm ripping the mp3 files at 32 kbps under Linux with gogo and the abcde package from Debian.</p>
