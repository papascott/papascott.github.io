<p>Reuters: <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20000118/ts/germany_opposition_4.html">Kohl Snubs Party After Scandal Ultimatum</a></p>
<p>Facing an ultimatum from his Christian Democratic party to reveal the sources of illegal campaign contributions he personally accepted, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl chose instead to resign as honorary party chairman. He was party leader for over 25 years, until last year.</p>
<p>27 minutes of the 30 minute evening news on <a href="http://www.zdf.msnbc.de">ZDF</a> were devoted to the scandal.</p>
<p>This is Germany's Watergate, and it's not over yet. The main difference is that it wasn't brought to light until after the Chief Executive was voted out of office.</p>
