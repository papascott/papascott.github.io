<p><b>03 Jan 7:45 am CET</b> Our first night together. Christopher is sleeping 5 hours at a stretch, so we were up only once. We're pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Christopher came about 4 pm today. We're using the basket from the baby carriage as his first bed. We can then carry him up or down the stairs to whatever room we're in. In this picture he's under the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>Looking at Christopher, I have the feeling I am looking in a mirror. To confirm the resemblence, here is a picture of me from  February 1962 (scanned Polaroid b&w snapshot) and of Christopher from his first day (digital photo converted to b&w)</p>
