<p>Right on time at 4:40pm, my folks, Christopher's grandparents, arrived in Hamburg from Minnesota to see their grandson. Christopher was a star, cooing and gurgling and otherwise making a very happy and satisfied first impression. He should be set for life now.</p>
<p>We had the camera along at the airport, but forgot about it. We never took it out of the diaper bag. Oh well.</p>
