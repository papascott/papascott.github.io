<p><i>For quite some time Christopher's favorite seemed to be " Da Da Da".  I couldn't figure out what he meant by saying that. He must have noticed because he switched to saying "Mum Mum Mum". Usually he says that right before, during or after his  meals. Maybe he's learned that his Mom has a lot do with his meals.</i></p>
<p><i>Christopher is also starting to enjoy his weekly  bath.</i></p>
<p>"bath"</p>
<p><i>He splashes so much water around that everyone gets wet!</i></p>
