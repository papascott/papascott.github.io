<p>ETPers working on taxes (a list in progress): <a href="http://cuwu.editthispage.com/2000/02/20">curmudgeon</a> <a href="http://array.editthispage.com/2000/02/21">array</a>. I just finished my <i>1998</i> German taxes in December. <i>Hee hee</i></p>
<p>German income tax is like US income tax back in the '70s. Very complicated and very expensive. Lots of rules and lots of deductions. The fifty-percent tax bracket is alive and well. However, my experience is that, unlike the American IRS, the German Finanzamt is staffed by living, feeling human beings. It's a local office rather than a faceless national bureaucracy.</p>
