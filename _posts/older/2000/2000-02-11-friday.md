<p>http://partykeller.editthispage.om/: yet another addition to <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$125">German EditThisPage / Manila Sites</a></p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom announces a flatrate for Internet access with T-Online. The monthly cost including all telephone and online charges will be under DM 100. I'm looking for a link in English.</p>
<p>The Telekom also announced this week an initiative to provide free Internet access to all German schools.</p>
