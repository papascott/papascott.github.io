<p>After taking several days off after returning from the hospital, Mama is again writing for the <a href="http://www.mausnews.de">Maus Newsletter</a>, mostly in German. Today she started her childbirth report.</p>
<p>It's hard to hold a baby and type at the computer simultaneously. Is there such a thing as a keyboard that can be used with one hand?</p>
<p>Oma is here for her first visit of Christopher. We have a couple of pictures in the Week 3 album at <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumList?u=185392">Photopoint</a></p>
