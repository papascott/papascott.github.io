<hr />
I see the weblog is on still on European time, so the date says Monday, even though it's still Sunday evening here in west-central Minnesota. We've got pictures from both Arizona and Minnesota at "photopoint".</p>
<p>We've both had fun watching the baseball divisional playoffs, especially knowing about the fervent Mariners and Mets fans in the editthispage audience. </p>
<p>But back home, I see Germany defeated England 1-0 at Wembley. I'll take a World Cup over a World Series anytime.</p>
