<p>My brother, who doesn't even own a computer, sent me this dubious electronic <a href="http://www.americangreetings.com/pickup.pd?i=49792032&m=7093&rr=y">Easter card</a>.</p>

<p>A smiley picture from this morning. He must be smiling because of the link from <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/04/23">Scripting News</a></p>
<p>Lots of new pictures at PhotoPoint: <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&a=5038363">1</a> <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&a=5039996">2</a> <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&a=5040043">3</a> <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&a=5038348">4</a>, count 'em, 4 albums!</p>

<p>The cows are back! Our neighbor Achim brought out his Charolais cattle yesterday. Their first stop is the pasture past the horse shed behind our house. They'll stay about a week before they move on. </p>
<p>The Easter Bonfire, on the night before Easter, is the big event of the year in LÃ¼llau. It's organized by the volunteer fire department. They gather the wood, set the fire and sell bratwurst, beer and schnaps. I'd say 300 people were there last night. </p>
<p>(Most of the little towns in this area have bonfires for Easter, but it doesn't seem to be a universal German tradition. Mama had never heard of it when she was growing up.)</p>
<p>Christopher started expressing displeasure at 9pm, so we went home earlier than we had planned.</p>
