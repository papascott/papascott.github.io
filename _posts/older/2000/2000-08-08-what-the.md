<p>I'm not really sure what this <a href="http://publog.medien.uni-weimar.de/clublog/">German Weblog Rallye</a> is all about, but I'll try just about anything once. That explains the funny text at the top of the page. (Hey, the rules said that the weblogger only has to speak German, not that the weblog itself is in German! ;-)</p>
<p>Not that it really matters to anyone but me, but I resolved over the weekend to switch my desktop PC from Linux to FreeBSD. I've been up and running since Saturday, and am slowly adding ports (ie extra programs) to my system.</p>
<p>"andrea" <a href="http://inessential.com">inessential</a> and <a href="http://array.editthispage.com">array</a> all discuss the merits of listing favorites. I list favorites for my own use only. I've gone back to a fixed list. It's somewhat out of date. I'd really like to include the updated favorites list from <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs</a>, but it is just too slow. Maybe I'll write a script to feed the favorites into my layout...</p>
