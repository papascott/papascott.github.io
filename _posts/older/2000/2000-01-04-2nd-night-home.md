<p><b>05 Jan 2000 3:45 am CET</b> Manila feature request for webmasters outside the US who are new parents: time zone support for websites. I want to flip my home page now, but I can't because for the server in California, it's still yesterday!</p>

<p>Christopher and I were sleeping at 4 am, and Mama was not. </p>
<p>We're preparing birth announcements with picture for the German relatives, since it's the kind of thing that's expected over here. We couldn't think of anything appropriately funny (my brother-in-law announced his first son with "The center of the universe weighs xxx grams, is xxx cm long, and is in bad mood at the moment"; we can't compete with that.) We took the plageristic route, stealing two quotes from a German baby <a href="http://www.babyzimmer.de">website</a> and combined them into one. Translation: "Already in our hearts, now also in our arms. On 27 December at 3:39 am the happiness in our lives became complete." <i>True, but sappy!</i></p>
