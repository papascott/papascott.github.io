<p><em><strong>... not even for a moment! </strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong><br />I'm guilty. I ran upstairs to get something - no, I did not check up on my stocks. When I returned, Christopher was sitting on the dishwasher door. I should be happy our son takes such a keen interest in household appliances. Before we know it he might volunteer to unload the dishes. Luckily the camera was right there on the kitchen counter. Obviously, the ear infection doesn't seem to bother him at all. Looks like we can start the nursery school practice sessions on Monday.</strong></em> </p>
