Mama has insisted on equal time. Here is her baby picture at age 10 days to show that Christopher has some resemblence to her as well. She also wants to point out that in June 1963 the punk hairstyle was quite futuristic. (More of her baby pics are <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&a=1529487">here</a>.)</p>
