<p>Surprise: <a href="http://surprise.editthispage.com/2000/06/06">Cobblestones for the eternity</a>:  "Have you ever driven with your car on a narrow street covered with cobblestones?" Our street in LÃ¼llau is cobblestone, and we used cobblestones for our driveway and patio. The rumble (in either the car or the baby rriage) is a sure sign for Christopher that we are almost home.</p>
