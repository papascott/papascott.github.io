<p>PapaScott (the website) is <a href="/1999/12/05">one year old</a> today. Thanks to "Userland" for providing at no cost the <a href="http://www.editthispage.com">webspace</a> and the software that makes it not only possible, but easy.</p>

<p>Our hosts Jörg and Susanne in Munich treated Christopher to a Bavarian breakfast: a fresh pretzel with butter and honey. It was amazing how all three could stick in his hair. And his face. And his clothes.</p>
<p>Jörg insisted that Christopher roll up his sleeves for the true Bavarian look. At least he didn't insist on Lederhosen!</p>
