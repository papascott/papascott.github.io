<p><a href="http://partykeller.editthispage.com/2000/05/17">partykeller</a> has a nice picture today of the Elbe River in Hamburg. To join in late on a conversation going on there and on <a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com">netdyslexia</a>, I buy my tomato juice in the 1 liter bottles from Becker's Beste.</p>
<p>Repeat after me: "When checking an apache installation, I will always check all the directory permissions, going all the way to /". I just wasted 2 days because someone messed up the / permissions.</p>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/">inessential</a> has two stories about Minnesota:  "The slumping Mariners <a href="http://www.cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/05/15/twins_mariners_ap/index.html">beat the Twins</a> last night 14-0." and "<a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/wire/2000/05/16/prince/index.html">Prince reclaims his name</a>. At long last."</p>
<p>Thanks to the magic of time differences and the Internet, I can follow the <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/baseball/mlbcom/audio/game.htm">audio</a> of the last inning of the Twins game in Seattle before going to work this morning. Hey, the Twins even scored a run, not that at losing 9-5 it made much difference.</p>
<p>Maybe I would have been better off being born a <a href="http://www.cubs.com">Cubs</a> fan, like the <a href="http://cuwu.editthispage.com/">Curmudgoen</a>. (Then again, maybe <a href="http://sports.latimes.com/news/20000517/bbo/los/20000517fuou8tke.html">not</a>.)</p>
