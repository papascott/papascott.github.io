<p>At work we held a 'Carribean House Warming' party for employees and invited guests, including Mama and Christopher, who even earned a few brownie points by schmoozing with the CEO.  Christopher held out for 3 hours, quite good actually, considering the loud music and poor accoustics. The company even announced that it might even start making money this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at home my new toy is a <a href="http://hardware.mp3.com/hardware/individual/home/2383.html">Yamakawa</a> (sold in the States as Raite) DVD/CD/MP3 player. The interesting thing about it is that it's basically constructed from PC components (at it's heart is an ATAPI DVD drive), so that it's (1) inexpensive and (2) programmable in various authorized and unauthorized ways.</p>
