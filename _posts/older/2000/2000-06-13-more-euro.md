<p>Group C: Norway 1 Spain 0, Yugoslavia 3 Solvenia 3. And I thought this would be the boring group, with Spain rolling over everyone else. Spain gets shut out, and Yugoslavia, down 3-0 with 10 players, score 3 goals within 6 minutes. </p>
<p>Group A: Portugal 3 England 2. They both looked better than Germany.</p>
