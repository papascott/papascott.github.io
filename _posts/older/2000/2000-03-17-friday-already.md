<p>I haven't been doing many updates here... it must be that extra hour per day I spend in traffic on the autobahn A1, waiting to get by that bridge they are fixing.</p>
<p>I did, however, prepare a couple of pictures for Mama, namely the <a href="http://Mama.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$64">cat tower</a> and the <a href="http://Mama.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$68">pregnant bellies</a>. And I was the one who rounded up the cats and put them in the tower. As for the bellies, can you guess which one had twins? (Hint: the twins together weighed less than Christopher at birth.)</p>
