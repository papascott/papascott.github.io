<p>I was bored with my layout, so I went "Aqua". It's was easy to do using the <a href="http://themes.weblogs.com/">themes</a> feature of "Manila". I still have to do some tweaking, though. The links to favorite sites need to be restored, and there's the old Manila problem of where to put the calendar.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm also bored with my content. I'm still haven't found the feature to quickly fix that.</p>
<p><b>DVD Alert</b> This eveningwe sent Christopher to bed early to watch our first DVD, a film that we missed last year. Matrix. We give it the highest possible compliment for Norwegian-Americans: not bad. Totally not bad.</p>
<p><b>Are we still boycotting Amazon?</b> Oh, I guess we <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2000/07/24#closeButNoCigar">are</a></p>
