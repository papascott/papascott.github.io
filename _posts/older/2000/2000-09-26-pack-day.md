<p>Today we pack, tomorrow we fly. Mama is already asking why I'm waiting until day. She claims to already be done with her things. </p>
<p>We're trying to stick to a single suitcase of clothes for the two of us. Christopher gets 3, with all his toys, sleep material, accesories, formula (as far as I can tell, hypo-allegenic formula is not available in the US except from a physician), food and diapers for the first couple of days.</p>
<p>Hopefully everything will work for the camera. We only have two compact flash cards, and no laptop, so we have to find a way to upload somehow. We'll bring all the cables and the card reader. We have two sets of rechargable batteries, but the charger only runs on 230 V. I also burned a fresh CD with pictures... over 1500 files.</p>
