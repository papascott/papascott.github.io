CNNSI: <a href="http://www.cnnsi.com/soccer/world/news/2000/03/11/german_roundup_ap/">Munich impressive without Matthaeus</a>:  "Third-place Hamburger SV stalled after losing 2-1 to Ulm, but  didn't lose much ground as the other candidates for a Champions Cup qualifying berth failed to win."</p>
<p> Ever since we've had a little hippo of our own in the house, we've taken more notice of hippo products in the marketplace. Here are a couple of examples that Mama could not resist. I imagine that the Happy Hippo Snack is a chocolate covered something. And as for the shower curtain, we needed a new one anyway.</p>
<p><b>Update Nov 2003</b> Since people keep asking, we bought the shower curtain at the German home improvement chain Obi.</p>
