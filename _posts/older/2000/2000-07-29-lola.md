<p>In our continuing attempt to catch up with the culture of the 20th century, we watched "Lola Rennt" (Run Lola Run) on DVD last night. It tells the same story 3 times, with various twists so that the endings are completely different, and ends by running the credits backwards.</p>
<p>Discovered by accident: <a href="http://WWW.GermanyByNET.com">GermanyByNET.com</a>, a cheesy German-American portal. However, they do have links to <a href="http://www.GermanyByNET.com/newsbot.asp?mode=AFP">German news stories in English</a>, and are sponsored by <a href="http://www.GermanDeli.com">GermanDeli.com</a>, where Americans can order German grocery products (read: coffee and chocolate).</p>
<p>It's been 5 days since the Concorde crash, but it continues to dominate the headlines here, even in our <a href="http://www.kreiszeitung-wochenblatt.de">little weekly shopper</a>. There I learned today that one of the victims lived just 5 km away in Buchholz.</p>
<p>Watch out for the <a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com/">NetDyslexics</a> this weekend! They're getting militant about <a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com/swoc">Sw/oC (Sundays without computers)</a>, and are punishing everyone who visits their site with a <a href="http://static.userland.com/images/netdyslexia/alien.gif">horrible blinking background graphic</a>. But something has gone wrong! The background's already been switched on, and it's still Saturday in most of the world! Including Jena! The horror, the horror...</p>
<p><a href="http://Mama.editthispage.com">Mama</a>, in case you haven't noticed, is taking a hopefully brief hiatus from her weblog. Her excuse is that, since she has stopped nursing Christopher, the title <a href="http://Mama.editthispage.com">Nursing 'n Surfing</a> is no longer appropriate.</p>
