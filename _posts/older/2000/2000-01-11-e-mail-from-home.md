<p>just thought i can drop you a quick note while you're at work. mom and i got a good start today. got out of bed at 8:30 and i dedcided to nap a little more in my basket. that way she could take a shower, dress and have breakfast before me. yes, i can be a pretty considerate kind of guy. now that i'm all set, she said we'll dress warm and drive to the post ofice for stamps and to minimal for some nursing type of groceries. sounds like a fun trip to me.</p>
<p>have a good day,</p>
