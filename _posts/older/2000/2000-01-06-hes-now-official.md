<p>Is it just me, or does a German birth certificate look more like a prescription than an official document?</p>

<p>At least it's cheap: DM 24, or $15. The <a href="http://www.usconsulate.de">US Consulate</a> wants $40 to register the birth to an American citizen abroad, and then another $40 for a child's passport.</p>
