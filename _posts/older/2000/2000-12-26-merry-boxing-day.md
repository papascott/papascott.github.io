<p>A plea to my fellow webloggers... please, please do not use the 'line-height' style attribute in your templates. With Netscape under Linux, it causes your graphics to be pasted over the following lines of text, making your site illegible. And I really do want to be able to read your site. </p>
<p>Here's how PapaScott would look to me if I hadn't commented out the line-height attribute:</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/12/lineheight.jpg" height="165" width="335" border="0" alt="lineheight.jpg: " /></p>
<p><b>Postscript</b> "Brent" recommends just <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/12/26">turning off style sheets in Netscape</a></p>
