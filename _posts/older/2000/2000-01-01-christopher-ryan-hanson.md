<p>Good news! Mama's fever is down, she and Christopher are feeling fine. If his bilirubin value keeps sinking, they can come home tomorrow or Monday. We'll know for sure around noon tomorrow.</p>
<p>We got a nice New Year's present from the German government today... a gas tax increase of 7 Pf went into effect, and the oil companies were kind enough to add 4 Pf of their own. I filled up for DM 1,90 today. That's over a dollar per liter... over $4 per gallon.</p>
