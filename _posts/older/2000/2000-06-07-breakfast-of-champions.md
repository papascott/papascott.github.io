<p>According to today's <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de">Hamburger Abendblatt</a>, every 5th wedding in Hamburg is binational.</p>
<p>Funny thing about the newspapers in Hamburg... the <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de">Abendblatt</a> is a morning paper, while you can get the <a href="http://www.mopo.de">Morgenpost</a> on the previous evening.</p>
<p>Breakfast is the hot topic on EditThisPage today. So what did this American living in Germany eat for breakfast this morning? Ahhh, I overslept and ran out of the house without any breakfast at all. However, I did bring along a strawberry yoghurt and picked up a ham <i>Br√∂tchen</i> from the delivery service at work.</p>
