<p><a href="http://andrea.editthispage.com/">Andrea</a>, here's a good example of the 'Big German Women' clich√©: <a href="http://www.stpauligirl.com/main.htm">St. Pauli Girl</a>, "Germany's Fun Loving Beer" which (AFAIK) is only sold outside of Germany. The girl, in this case, is American.</p>
<p><img src="/images/mausnews/mtp.jpg" align="right" />Our move at work to Millerntorplatz seems to be proceeding with no problems. I was on call, but nobody called. We had set up a substitute firewall and web server at the new office last week, and they covered the web site during the move. I haven't even been to the new location yet. </p>
<p>Even though I'm not supposed to print my playlist at <a href="http://www.live365.com/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?genre=search&searchdesc=papascott&autostart=papascott">PapaScott Radio</a>, I hope it's OK to give hints...</p>
<p><b>Music</b></p>
<p>Reading how Brent was reminiscing about The Clash reminded me that I didn't have any CDs at all fro a band that was one of my favorites at the end of high school, when I first heard <a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=74646388525">"London Calling"</a>. Well, sure enough, buying groceries with Christopher this morning, I was "Lost in the Supermarket" (actually, it was Marktkauf) and happened upon the CD. Mama saw it when I got home and remarked that I was reverting to my childhood.</p>
<p>Also, a day without <a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=731453082724">The Supremes</a> is like a day without sunshine...</p>
