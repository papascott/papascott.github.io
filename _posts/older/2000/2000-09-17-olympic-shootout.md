<p>To bad we didn't do the weblog shootout yesterday... we would have had a lot of fun pictures. We're having the patio extended behind the carport, and a mini-backhoe rumbled through our backyard to haul away the dirt. We also had bath day with Christopher, attended a baby-flea-market in Holm-Seppensen (we spent DM 10 for a stocking cap, a bottle warmer, and a Fisher-Price radio), we had a very pregnant visitor, and I started reorganizing my desk, moving the secondary PCs to the shelves behind me. Today all we have planned is swimming at the Salztherme (salt spa) in LÃ¼neburg.</p>
