<p>A TV film crew is in LÃ¼llau, filming at the farm place across the street. Mama says that Heinz Reincke (Germans will know who he is... he looks like the typical North German grandpa, even though he actually lives in Vienna) had to drive 6 times down our street for the camera. The scene being filmed this evening seemed to involve a big white billy goat.</p>
<p>When our office was on the Hamburg Harbor, I'd see film crews there practicall every week. Our new office, though, is on the wrong part of the Reeperbahn to attract any film crews. The red light district is at the other end.</p>
