<p>Here is Christopher just waking up this morning. (April 23: Christopher says, "Thanks for the <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/04/23">link</a>, Dave. I'll take that as a compliment!") Points of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>He's wearing his Oshkosh locomotive pyjamas, from John and Diane
</li>
<li>He's kicked the covers off, as usual
</li>
<li>He's not smiling, because he sees the camera
</li>
<li>He's lying crooked, with feet slightly to the left. He`d turn completely to the left if he could.
</li>
<li>Be thankful that <a href="http://www.digiscents.com">DigiScents</a> is not activated for this page</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://Mama.editthispage.com">Mama</a> has a picture of a <a href="http://Mama.editthispage.com/2000/04/19">complete left turn</a>. He just slides under the side of the gym.</p>
