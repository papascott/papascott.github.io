<p>Christopher and I are taking the day off together. Mama is a a one-day road trip, and we have to hold down the fort. </p>
<p>While Christopher took his morning nap. I played with some layout ideas in the <a href="http://shanson.weblogs.com/">Tech Diary</a>. The calendar is too wide for the navigation column in Windows, so I'm trying out a separate "window" to the side, with the favorites update underneath. I love the favorites macro, but I don't like the fixed layout and even less that it forces the entire page to wait until it's loaded. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com">NetDyslexics</a> have shunted the calendar and their favorites to the bottom of the page, leaving only an anchor link at the top. That's a good idea too.</p>
<p>We visited my old work colleagues at <a href="http://www.int-res.com">Inter-Research</a>. They still recognized me!</p>
