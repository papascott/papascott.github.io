<p>We made it to Arizona at midnight Thursday morning. The temperature at that time (over 90F) was warmer than the entire summer in Hamburg.</p>
<p>Christopher travelled much better than either of us, as I expected. We had normal tourist-class seats with Christopher on my lap. He slept, I couldn't move.</p>
<p>After spending yesterday in jet-lag limbo, we're going to try to enjoy the sun today. We had Mexican food last night, tomorrow night we'll go to our first major league baseball game in over 6 years. It's little things like that that I miss. But not often.</p>
