<p>Christopher is 13 weeks old today, which happens to also be exactly 3 months. Time to start counting in months instead of weeks! </p>
<p>He's starting to have some loud crying phases. Our first few weeks of the quiet baby with no problems to speak of were indeed too good to be true. Is he teething? Maybe... anyway, he and Mama are exhausted this evening. She won't be flipping her home page today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we're getting ready for my folks to visit their new grandson for 2 1/2 weeks starting on Friday. We're having Christopher baptized this Sunday, and otherwise we have no fixed plans for their stay. We can't make any big trips... niether of our cars can accomodate 4 adults and a child seat!</p>
