<p>After a wet and sloppy snow day yesterday, it turned cold and clear last night. We bundled up Christopher and went for <a href="http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$109">a walk</a>.</p>
<p>Christopher felt right at home at the party last night. We stayed over an hour. When we got home, Mama and I were went straight to bed, but Christopher was ready for more! (Note for our to-do list: teach Christopher the difference between day and night.)</p>
