<p>In Seattle they blow up old stadiums after they build new ones. In Hamburg, they keep playing in the old <a href="http://www.stevie-online.de/stadion/bilder1.html">Volksparkstadion</a> even while it's being rebuilt. Over the summer, they twisted the field 90 degrees so that the old end zone seats moved to midfield. This week they are starting on the roof fabric... several weeks behind schedule. (Best of all, the club is paying for the new stadium. Having taxpayers pay for sports stadiums is an American idocy.)</p>
