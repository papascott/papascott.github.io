<p><a href="http://Mama.editthispage.com/2000/02/05">Mama</a> is going grouse hunting! The "Moorhuhnjagd" is a free game that is taking over PCs in Germany. It lasts just 90 seconds, and there are only 3 commands: space to start, left click to shoot anything that moves, and right click to reload. It's in German, but simple for anyone to figure out. http://www.johnniewalker.de/moorhuhn/jwjagd.exe (1.9 MB)</p>
