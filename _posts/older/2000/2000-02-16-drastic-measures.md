<p>Time to break out the baby pictures... I need hits for the <a href="http://www.editthispage.com/Top100">Top 100</a>!</p>
<p>About to replace me in the Top 10, and much more deserving, is the <a href="http://popo.editthispage.com/">discussion section</a> of <a href="http://www.popo.at/">popo.at</a>, an Austrian site with politcial reaction to their new government. popo stands for "politcal potential". <i>Move your popo and your ass will follow!</i> </p>

<p>BBC: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_645000/645038.stm">German scandal topples party leader</a> "The CDU's crisis must not be allowed to become a crisis for democracy. This goal overrides all others."</p>
<p>Furnace update: It turns out it had overheated yesterday, and the plumber only needed to push the reset button (marked 'For Technician Use Only'). He didn't find anything else wrong. <i>Is this something like Ctrl-Alt-Delete?</i></p>
