<p>Yahoo! Deutschland <a href="http://de.news.yahoo.com/000302/9/m23f.html">Elbtunnelbohrer «Trude» ist zurück aus der Tiefe</a> "Trude" is the largest drill bit in the world (14.2 m diameter, 2000 metric tons), digging a 4th tube for the congested Elbe Autobahn tunnel under Hamburg's harbor. Today, after nearly 2 miles and 2-1/2 years, it reached the surface on the north side of the Elbe. However, the tube will not pen for traffic for another 2 years. <i>«Trude» is a girl's name, but in this case stands for «tief runter unter die Elbe»  -  deep down under the Elbe.</i></p>

He was particularly interested in Rochester and Bemidji, so I covered those parts of the state a little more thoroughly than others." <i>(via <a href="http://brdbrain.editthispage.com">brdbrain</a>)</i></p>

<p>Slashdot  <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/03/01/092251&mode=thread"> Free Internet Access for Hamburgers</a>:  The city of Hamburg has announced "that all of its citizens will receive free Internet access... Citizens will pay no direct provider costs, only telephone costs." <i>Full telephone costs? Since Germans still pay for each local call, AOL would be a better deal for most people...</i></p>
