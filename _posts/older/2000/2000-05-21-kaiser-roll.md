<p>Familie Berg describes <a href="http://familieberg.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$213">Moritz Tagesablauf</a> (in German), the daily routine for the 8 month old Moritz. This all sounds very familiar (especially the part about changing the diaper when it smells suspicious).</p>
<p>Mama keeps asking me what her plants are called in English. <a href="http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/">Den virtuella floran</a> is a multilingual botanical database from Sweden. Alas, the text is all in Swedish, but you can look up common names in a number of languages.</p>

<p>It took Christopher just 10 minutes to slide and roll his way the 2 meters from the corner under the teddy bear mobile to just behind Mama's desk. We thought it was pretty cute until he started tugging on Mama's mouse cable.</p>
