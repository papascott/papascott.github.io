<p>Three years have gone by, the lease has expired on our Volkswagen Sharan mini-van, and it's time for something new. The Sharan was way too big for us. We thought we could use the extra space for our business, but in the 3 years we transported 8 passengers exactly one time. In that same time had to replace bumpers 3 times (twice my fault, once my wife's) because the Sharan so damn wide you're scraping something before you know it. In that sense, good riddance. </p>
<p>We're on good terms with our local Volkswagen dealer, and we decided to downsize to the newest member of the VW line, the <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2015-volkswagen-sportwagen-golf-variant-first-drive-review">Golf Variant</a>, a station wagon. It was released in September, we ordered right away, and took delivery at the end of January (that is, today). </p>
<p>Now, my wife gets a lot more excited about cars than I. She'll study the web sites and the specs to find exactly what she wants. For me, a car is simply a vehicle to take me from A to B. She's excited about the new car and what it can do. I'm just happy that it's smaller and we're less likely to tear off a bumper.</p>
<p>And I hope that choice is right because the lease is for another three years.</p>
