<p>We decided to spend some money on ourselves rather than the business for a change. When we built our house back in 1996, when we got to designing the bathroom we had run out of both money and imagination. We ended with boring hospital-white. We* tore everything out, replaced and rearranged the fixtures, threw out the tub, built a new wall, replaced the door and window, and installed a walk-in spa-like shower. After two and half weeks without a bath, it's done enough that we can use it. We're missing a few details yet, like towel hooks, toilet paper dispenser, mirrors, and cabinets.</p>
<p>*Of course, "we did" actually means "we hired professionals to do", but we did build the Ikea Godmorgen sink cabinet ourselves. </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've now added panorama photos und put them all in a Flickr album.</p>
