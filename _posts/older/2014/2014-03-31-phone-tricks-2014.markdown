<p>To keep in touch with home I find it handy to have an US phone number. We never got in the habit of using Skype; a cordless phone is just a lot handier than turning on the PC. For a while I had a US Skype Number with a Minnesota area code. However, at â‚¬5 a month it's not that cheap, and worse, my parents were not able to reach the number from their cell phones. And if I forward the calls to our regular German number, I pay Skype rates for the privilege.</p>
<p>So I did some hunting around, and discovered the VOIP provider <a href="http://www.anveo.com/consumer/default.asp">Anveo</a> offers US numbers pay-as-you-go for $2 a month (<a href="http://www.anveo.com/consumer/mainphonenumbers.asp">"Personal Unlimited"</a> plan). You can then forward the calls to a regular number at their normal rates, but since we have VOIP at home anyway, I just set them up as an additional account and pay nothing. Calls to the US cost $0.01 per minute, slightly cheaper than our main provider. They have servers in both the US and Germany. We've been with them for 2 months, and they seem to work just fine.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, our main VOIP (for home and home office) is on <a href="http://www.sipgate.de/team/voip">Sipgate Team</a> with a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004U6NTXU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B004U6NTXU&linkCode=as2&tag=papascott-21">Gigaset C610 IP</a><img src="//ir-de.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=papascott-21&l=as2&o=3&a=B004U6NTXU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> base station. I tried first with a Fritz Box, but never managed to get it working reliably, probably because the Fritz Box was not our router, but behind our router.</p>
<p>The other trick to plan mobile phone and data for our visits to the US. Prepaid credit expires quickly in the States, so if you're there just once or twice a year it's likely cheapest to set up something new each year. This year we're trying service from <a href="http://goredpocket.com/">Red Pocket</a> sold by <a href="http://www.reisesim.de/">ReiseSIM.de</a> in Germany. The SIMs are pre-activated, you can add credit before your trip, and you can dial direct without going through a gateway to call Germany. Calls are $0.10/min in the US and $0.11/min to Germany. Network is ATT, and for the data plans <a href="http://goredpocket.com/plans#gsmt-mi">"tethering is encouraged"</a> (that was our mistake last year, no tethering, and we constantly fought over the one tablet with internet). Our son will be taking a phone on his Easter trip to Minnesota, and we're in Orlando for business at the end of April, so we'll see how it goes.</p>
