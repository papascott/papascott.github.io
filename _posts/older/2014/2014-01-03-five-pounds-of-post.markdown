<p>Here's a week's worth of documents, weighing in at 2.4 kg, for our accountant, in case you've wondered if we've done any work over the holidays. It's a bit more than usual since it's end-of-month, we normally have 1.0 to 1.5 kg per week. (Yes, it's all scanned as well, but we don't have a digital workflow with the accountant yet.)</p>
