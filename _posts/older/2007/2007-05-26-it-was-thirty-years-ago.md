<p>Hal remembers that 30 years ago this weekend:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The movie Star Wars (AKA: Star Wars: A New Hope) opened in theaters across the country and set the record for the largest grossing film to date. In my mind, which seldom accounts for much, there are only <em>real</em> three Star Wars movies called Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. None of them have the prefix Star Wars:.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He also has a link to the original review in the New York Times: <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=2&amp;title1=&amp;title2=Star%20Wars%20%28Movie%29&amp;reviewer=VINCENT%20CANBY&amp;pdate=19770526&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=login">Star Wars A Trip to a Far Galaxy Thats Fun and Funny</a>.</p>
<p>Christopher is, shall we say, intensely familiar with both trilogies and contributes most of his allowance money to Lego for their line of Star Wars sets.</p>
<p>As for me, Star Wars was my <em>second</em> favorite movie while in high school. The movie that most entertained and inspired me as teenager came out a year later... <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0077975/">Animal House</a>.</p>
