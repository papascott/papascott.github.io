<p>Yesterday we attended the wedding of our good friends <a href="http://www.heidi-ritter.de/">Heidi</a> and Robert. The catering crew graciously allowed Christopher to assist serving drinks to the guests. He took this responsibility quite seriously and performed quite well.</p>

<p>The wedding was held at the historic windmill in <a href="http://www.buchholz.de/city_info/anzeige/redaktionssystem/main/show.cfm?region_id=202&amp;ID=6645">Buchholz-Dibbersen</a>. We didn't even know there was a windmill in Dibbersen, even though we drive through all the time to get to the Autobahn A1. We were very impressed with the location, and we might be back since we have a <a href="/archives/2006/09/10/23rd-anniversary/">small celebration to plan for September 2008</a>.</p>
