<blockquote><p>
  In early March Berlin's Interior Senator Ehrhart Körting (SPD) allowed a young women to be <a href="http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2007/0413/politik/0074/index.html">deported to Turkey</a> who is not Turkish and does not speak Turkish. Nasima El-Zein grew up in Berlin, graduated from <em>Realschule</em>, helped foreign schoolchildren as a volunteer in the problem neighborhood of <em>Neukölln</em>, helped them with math and German. Who came up with the idea to deport this woman to a land where a violent father awaits to lock her up and send her to a forced marriage? Today the <a href="http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/print/berlin/652190.html"><em>Berliner Zeitung</em> wrote</a> that the Kurdish woman has been pressured by the Turkish police, and threatened with violence. I think not only the behavior of the Turkish authorities, but also that of Berlin's Interior Senator, to be a scandal. One can only suspect that because the police and the authorities are unable to handle a few wild Turkish-Lebanese families in <em>Neukölln</em> and <em>Rudow</em>, the so-called "bouncer mafia", that they are making an example of this young woman, making a scapegoat of someone who is integrated and cannot defend herself, deporting her to Turkey simply to quiet public opinion.</p>
<p>  These actions from Hr. Körting are not only reprehensible, but also violate the principles of his party, the SPD, and human rights... As a party member, I will formally request the expulsion of Hr. Körting from the party. And when the young woman has not returned to Berlin by the end of May 2007, I will take my party book, which documents over 35 years of membership in the SPD, and publicly burn it (i.e. a video will be posted here) and I will urge my fellow party members to do the same.

<p>Jörg himself lives in <em>Neukölln</em>, so I'm sure he knows what he's talking about. I've heard of some wild deportation cases in Germany, but this seems to rank with the wildest of them.</p>
