<p>Today is closet cleaning day. Everything that hasn't been worn for a year will be considered for the <em>Altkleidersammlung</em>. Items with sentimental value are however excluded.</p>

<p>MamaMaus made this as my Christmas present in 1982 (or was it 1981?). I know there are a few <a href="http://sibylle.blogg.de/">knitting fans</a> among my readers.</p>
<p>There's no danger of PapaScott becoming a knitting blog, though. MamaMaus hasn't touched a knitting needle in nearly 25 years.</p>
