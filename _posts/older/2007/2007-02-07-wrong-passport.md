<p>From a <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2338613,00.html">Deutsche Welle analysis of the Kurnaz case</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Legally, Berlin was under no obligation to protect a German-born Turkish citizen imprisoned in Guantanamo. But moral and political responsibility for a permanent resident unjustly detained is another matter, experts say.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Um, right, like the German government is going to lift a finger for <em>me</em> if I ever get in trouble. Let's just say that if I've got one phone call before I get shipped to the Gulag, I'm calling the embassy with the blue passports, not the one with the red passports.</p>
