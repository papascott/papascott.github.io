<p>One the one hand, here it is currently <em>en vogue</em> to complain about amoral American hedge funds, comparing them to locusts. Today on NDR Info I heard about the shareholders' meeting of <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,464443,00.html">Cewe Color</a>. Its hedge fund shareholders are demanding the resignation of the CEO and a special debt-financed dividend for shareholders (i.e. themselves).</p>
<p>On the other hand, this week <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,479631,00.html">Klaus Kleinfeld resigned</a> as chairman of Siemens. A big factor in his resignation was apparently the tougher corporate ethics regulation in the US, which applies to Siemens since it is listed on the NYSE.</p>
<p>I'm confused now about which country has the more moral corporations.</p>
