<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2117336884" title="View 'card 2007' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2239/2117336884_495c07304e_m.jpg" alt="card 2007" border="0" width="171" height="240" align="right" /></a> We're absolutely unprepared for Christmas this year (it always comes so unexpectedly every December). At work we've set the Christmas party for the end of January and are calling it a "End of Year" party. People seem to have more time in for Christmas parties in January anyway.</p>
<p>At least I got our photo cards ready for our friends and relatives in the States (as always at the <a href="http://www.usps.com/cardstore/">USPS Card Store</a>, where they mail the cards for us at domestic rates). Nothing new in the card if you read PapaScott regularly, but I did come up with a couple of good lines...</p>
<blockquote><p>
  After 24 years of Frauke working for McDonald's, McDonald's now works for us!
</p></blockquote>
<p>(Almost sounds like a Soviet Russia joke. :-) )</p>
<blockquote><p>
  (Christopher) keeps reminding us what is really important, and makes our lives a joy (even if it is sometimes a little messy).
</p></blockquote>
<p>I now notice I have at least one typo in the final version of the printed card. That's the nice thing about the internet... you can always go back and correct your speling.</p>
