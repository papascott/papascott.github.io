<p>That Hillary Clinton is running for President is about as surprising as the Pope being Catholic or the bear shitting in the woods, but the German press isn't very well informed on US politics, so she's been the big news here for past day. Her picture even <a href="http://www.welt.de/data/2007/01/20/1184167.html">made the the front page</a> of the conservative Welt am Sonntag (which we only read for the real estate ads). The online edition is even running a story about <a href="http://www.welt.de/data/2007/01/21/1184198.html">Hillary's alter-ego</a>, so I guess they're paying some attention.</p>
<p>Of course to truly make sense of American politics we have to turn to an analyst like Scott Adams, who today <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/01/flipflopper_sea.html">explains</a> why we punish politicians for acting rational and why he already feels good about a Clinton/Obama ticket. Hey, it makes me feel good too!</p>
