<p>Meet Tinti, Netzi and Nepomuk, an octopus, spider, and dragon that Christopher freed from Ikea yesterday. His shopping was more successful than mine. The shelves I brought home were the wrong color (birch instead of beech).</p>
<p>The box and the styrofoam peanuts were a late Christmas package from Arizona, and were more fun than any toy.</p>
