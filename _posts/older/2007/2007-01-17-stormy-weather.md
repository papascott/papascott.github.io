<p>MamaMaus has a business meeting in Westerland on the island of Sylt tomorrow afternoon, to be followed in the evening by a reception in the <a href="http://www.sansibar-sylt.de/">Sansibar</a> beach-side restaurant.</p>
<p>The weather service is forecasting a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,460452,00.html">severe storm for all of Germany</a> tomorrow evening, especially severe on the North Sea coast, with winds in excess of 150 km/h.</p>
<p>I hope she's not planning a moonlight walk on the beach.</p>
