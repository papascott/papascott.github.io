<p>After we <a href="/archives/2007/04/10/dreams-for-sale-4645/">exercised options last week</a> at $46.45, the price of MCD has shot up on better than expected 1Q earnings. Today <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MCD">MCD closed at $48.10</a>. I knew something like that would happen.</p>
<p>If you want to plan to profit from our poor market timing, our next option package is exercisable at the end of May.</p>
