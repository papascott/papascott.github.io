<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/452017708/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/226/452017708_f9558620da.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="0402-135423" /></a></p>
<p>I'm just now getting over the Easter flu and we're heading off for family events this afternoon, so I'll just point to the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157600058152348/">photo set from our Oslo trip</a> and write about the trip later. I'll let you guess which photos Christopher took (hint: he's interested in fire extinguishers and wastebaskets, but not so much in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Belt_Bridge">bridges</a>).</p>
