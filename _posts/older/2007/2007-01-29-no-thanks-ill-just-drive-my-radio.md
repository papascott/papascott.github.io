<p>He: If anyone asks*, for my birthday I'd like money to get myself a new car radio.</p>
<p>She: Your car radio works just fine. Why don't you buy a new car?</p>
<p>He: ?!?</p>
<p>(*Actually the question "What do you want for Christmas/your birthday" could be the subject of an entire expat post, although I'm not sure if all Germans are obsessive about this question, or just my in-laws. They also always ask my wife what I want instead of me personally. Maybe they got tired of me answering "World peace".)</p>
