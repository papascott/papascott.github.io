<p>A couple of weeks ago the <a href="http://www.mcc-nordheide.de/">Mini-Car-Club Nordheide</a> asked us if we'd like to sponsor an event on the vacant lot next to our restaurant. The idea was so wild we just had to say yes... a pulling contest for remote-controlled models (1:5/1:6) featuring a 60 cm replica of a Big Mac with up to 22 kg. The <a href="http://www.bigmac-pulling.de/">Big Mac Pulling</a> will take place on Sunday, September 30, 9:00 to 18:00. Buchholz has Sunday shopping on that day as well, so those not interested in cars and dirt will have something to do as well.</p>
