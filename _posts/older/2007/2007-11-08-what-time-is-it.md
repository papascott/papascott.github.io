<p>After my <a href="/archives/2007/11/07/what-if-you-get-stopped/">entry yesterday</a>, here is yet another in the ongoing series "Germans are Strange and Wonderful Creatures"...</p>
<p>Ten days ago Europe switched back from Daylight Savings to Standard Time, turning the clocks back one hour on Sunday morning at 3 am. Our McDrive is open until 4 am on weekends, and we made the decision not to stay open an extra hour for the time change.</p>
<p>I had night shift that night, and I closed at 4 am DST as planned. Twenty minutes later a very angry guest pounded on our drive-thru window. It was 3:20, we should be open, and why wouldn't we serve him?</p>
<p>As is often the case with arrogant Germans, technically he was correct. Standard Time was in effect, the time was 3:20 am. However, it's my business and I can open and close the doors when I damn well please. I shouted politely but firmly through the closed window that we were closed, and that if he did not leave the premises in 5 minutes I would call the cops.</p>
<p>The angry guest then left. Being a know-it-all German means that you can often be smug about being correct, but it usually doesn't make things any better. He was still hungry.</p>
