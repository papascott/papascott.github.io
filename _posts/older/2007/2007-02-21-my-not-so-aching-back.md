<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.paradox1x.org/weblog/kmartino/archives/004709.shtml">Karl and everyone else</a> who wished me well for my birthday, despite my post telling everyone not to.</p>
<p>As for my back, I'm making good progress. As my father phrased it, it no longer hurts, it's just stiff and sore. I can sleep through the night without pain, and today I drove to Hamburg and back without any pain for the first time since November. I must be doing something right.</p>
