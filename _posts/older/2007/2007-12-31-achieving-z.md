<p>One month after our re-opening we're very happy with the new look and the McCaf&eacute;. Our customers seem to be happy with it as well. I can't talk about numbers here, so I'll use letters instead. </p>
<p>Our monthly sales started at a level of *x*, and in our business plan we estimated that after the remodel they would increase to *y*. After 3 to 5 years of hard work and good business practices we estimated we could achieve a level of *z*.</p>
<p>As of yesterday we have already achieved *z* for December 2007.</p>
<p>That of course does not rule out the hard work and good business practices for the future... we want *z* to be the average for all months, and not just be the best month of the year. But it's yet another sign we're moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>In the short run, achieving *z* when your crew schedule and logistics have been planned for *y* presents problems of its own (i.e. short of crew and low on stock). </p>
<p>And even when you've achieved *z* that doesn't mean you can rest on your laurels. There's always the next step, *z*+1.</p>
<p>And on that note... Happy New Year, everyone!</p>
