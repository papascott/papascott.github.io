<p>I resumed the <a href="http://www.stern.de/weinschule">Stern wine school</a>, which I <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/16/wine-school/">started last week</a>, on the night of the big storm last Thursday. The next lesson was another Bordeaux, this one a price class higher. The <a href="http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/kueche/getraenke/580331.html?eid=580464">2004 Dutruch</a> costs Â€20, so I wasn't greatly disappointed that my first impression was that it was way too bitter for my taste. I certainly did not detect the aroma of tea leaves, tobacco or pencil shavings mentioned by Messrs. Lange and Lange.</p>
<p>Unforunately for my wallet the Dutruch tasted much better the next day, after I had left the remaining half-bottle corked at room temperature overnight. I guess I should take the temperature recommendations and the suggestion that it be decanted more seriously. The price is too rich for for me for everyday consumption, but I could see keep a few bottles in the basement (or in the closet, as the Langes suggest) for special occasions. It's supposed to only get better for the next 3 to 5 years.</p>
<p>The next wine is also from Bordeaux, this time a fresh white wine. It doesn't seem right for January, but we'll see.</p>
