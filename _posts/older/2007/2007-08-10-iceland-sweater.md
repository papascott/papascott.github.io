<p>At the duty-free shop at Keflavik airport, I found an Iceland sweater with a unique new technology that warms from both the inside and the outside simultaneously. It was a deal I could not resist.</p>

<p>Here's what the inside looks like. The label says something about "black death". I hope we won't be regretting my purchase.</p>
