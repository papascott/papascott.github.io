<p>PapaScott (the blog, not the man) took an unexpected <a href="http://flickr.ishavingamassage.com/">massage</a> the past couple of days. My MySQL database seems to have disappeared from my hoster, just a couple of days after upgrading to WordPress 2.3. I didn't have time to track down the problem, I simply restored the last backup dump (which I mail to myself daily), which of course had character set issues (mixed latin1 and utf8 characters). But now we're running pure UTF-8 on MySQL 5.0, and everything should be fine until I have to restore from backup again.</p>
