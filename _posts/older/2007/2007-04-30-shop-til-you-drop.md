<p>The regulation of shopping hours in Germany is now a matter for the states rather than the federal government, and most states have taken the opportunity to deregulate shopping hours Monday through Saturday. Here in Niedersachsen the deregulation took effect this month, and our local Rewe supermarket is now open until 9:00 pm 6 days a week. We've taken advantage of the extra hour a few times already. </p>
<p>When we came to Germany the restricted shopping hours was the biggest thing I had to get used to. Back then shops closed at 6:30 pm during the week and 2:00 pm on Saturday. But the times have become longer and longer, first until 8:00 pm on weekdays, and then 8:00 pm every Saturday. Now it's a non-issue, and I imagine that sooner or later Sunday closing will also be a thing of the past.</p>
