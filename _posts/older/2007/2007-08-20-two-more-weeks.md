<p>We're still busy at the restaurant covering management shifts for vacations. The end is in sight. The last assistant just started his vacation, and by September we'll be back to full strength. We'll also have a couple people who can cover a couple of hours between shifts, so we won't need to cover every minute of every day with a salaried manager.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.vattenfall-cyclassics.de/">Vattenfall Cyclassics</a> bicycle race went by our restaurant yesterday, with the highway closed at our intersection the entire morning. We didn't know if it would be a boom or a bust. It turned out to be a bust. The road was closed well in front of the restaurant, no cars could reach us, and our noon business was basically nothing. During school vacation business has been pretty unpredictable. We're looking forward to school starting again in two weeks so that both we and our customers have regular schedules again.</p>
