<p>As you can see, we've started setting up our business. </p>
<p>In the upper left you can see the two founders. They are stubborn as donkeys, and have already dressed warm (*haben sich warm angezogen*) in preparation for the tough times ahead. Between them is a crystal ball with a vision of the future.</p>
<p>To their right is a device for cutting costs. If twisted just right it can also be used to cut corners. On the shelf beneath them we are trying to bring light into the darkness. </p>
<p>(Hmm, somehow this seemed much funnier when we were cleaning out the shelf. But the two binders to the left are really our first business files.)</p>
