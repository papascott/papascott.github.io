<p>Today's Abendblatt has an article on <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/05/19/742340.html">Hamburg's Coffee Mile</a> on Grindelalle near the University, where 18 coffee shops are located on a 700 meter stretch. None of them are Starbucks. (None of them is a McCafé, either.)</p>
<p>The largest shop seems to be <a href="http://www.balzaccoffee.com/">Balzac Coffee</a>, which has 15 coffee shops in Hamburg, and according the Abendblatt they are planning on opening 15 more this year. Vanessa Kullmann, the founder of Balzac, has just written a book <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.de%2Fdp%2F3453131118%2F&amp;site-redirect=de&amp;tag=papascott-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742">"Keine große Sache"</a> telling how she started up. MamaMaus received it as a gift as an inspiration for her new business.</p>
<p>(I think there are 4 Starbucks in Hamburg, but I'm not sure, and the <a href="http://www.starbucks.de/de-de/_Our+Stores/">store locator</a> on their website <a href="http://www.starbucks.de/de-de/_Our+Stores/_Store+Locator/StoreLocatorPrxResults.htm?a=1&amp;LOC=53.5534027536164%3a9.99246857175934&amp;CT=53.5534027536164%3a9.99246857175934%3a42.7503380259286%3a32.0627535194464&amp;DataSource=MapPoint.EU&amp;GAD2=&amp;GAD3=Hamburg%2c+Hamburg%2c+Germany&amp;IC=53.5534027536164%3a9.99246857175934%3a32%3aHamburg%2c+Hamburg%2c+Germany&amp;CountryID=94&amp;FC=RETAIL&amp;Radius=5&amp;DistanceUnit=Kilometer">can't find any</a>.)</p>
