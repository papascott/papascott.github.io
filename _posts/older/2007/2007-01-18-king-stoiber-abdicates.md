<p>It is somehow appropriate that <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2317414,00.html">Edmund Stoiber announced his resignation</a> as Bavarian Premier and CSU party head on the day of the worst weather in Germany in years. Were it not for bad weather that brought on the Elbe floods in 2002, we could be very well be at the beginning of the second term of a Stoiber chancellorship. He couldn't formulate a response back then. Thinking on his feet was never one of his strengths. It's probably just as well that he lost to Schr√∂der.</p>
<p>Those of us who view politics as entertainment will miss him greatly.</p>
