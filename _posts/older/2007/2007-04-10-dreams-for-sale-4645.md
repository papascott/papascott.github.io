<p>Seeing as we have a <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/03/27/bricks-and-mortar/">need for cash</a> in the next couple of months, MamaMaus exercised some of her stock options last night at $46.45.</p>
<p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070409/mcdonald_s_executive_compensation.html">Unlike Jim</a>, she doesn't have to disclose her income or stock transactions. I mention this only as a public service to our readers, since we are notoriously bad at timing stock transactions. Sure, we sold on the day of a 7-year high, but <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MCD">MCD</a> is probably going to take off like a rocket now.</p>
