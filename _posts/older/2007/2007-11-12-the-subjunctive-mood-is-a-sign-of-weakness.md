<p>I've reported before that in Germany you have to <a href="/archives/2007/05/16/the-problem-with-no/">say no very directly</a> for it to be understood as no. I've recently discovered that the same principle can apply to "yes".</p>
<p>Recently in a hotel Frauke mislaid her cell phone and sent me to the reception desk to check if anyone had found it. Indeed, a cell phone had been found, and it looked very similar to Frauke's phone, and I was asked if it was her phone. I couldn't be sure, though, without opening the case, so trying to be friendly and polite I replied "Yes, it could be." <em>(Ja, es k&ouml;nnte sein.)</em></p>
<p>This was not accepted as an affirmative reply. I forget the exact response, but it was along the lines of "Well are you sure or are you not?" or "Is that supposed to be yes or no?" I had to start over and say that Frauke's name would appear on the display when it was turned on, and that would prove whether it was her phone or not.</p>
<p>In Germany it pays to be sure of yourself, even when you're not. Arrogance here is not a negative attribute, but rather a prerequisite. :-)</p>
