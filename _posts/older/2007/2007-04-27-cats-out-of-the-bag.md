<p><a href="http://shoppero.com/"><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/shoppero.png" alt="shoppero" align="right" title="shoppero" /></a>Nico's <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3407">confirmed</a> the <a href="http://ecommerce.typepad.com/exciting_ecommerce/2007/04/shoppero.html">rumor</a>, he's <a href="http://www.basicthinking.de/blog/2007/04/27/warum-shoppero-lumma-nach-hamburg-zog/">coming back</a> to Hamburg to lead a new startup called <a href="http://shoppero.com/">Shoppero</a>. And here I was all set to start a counter-rumor that he was really coming to Hamburg to start working for us.</p>
<p>I did some initial systems consulting for the project (OK, it was more like "Can you set up a server for us?" "Sure, no problem."), so I've been in on the secret. And note that they have a .com domain rather than .de. Their plans for world domination are not limited to the German-speaking world.</p>
<p>Another tidbit: the project has been blogging under a code name in English for several weeks, but the rumormongers don't seem to have found it yet. :-)</p>
