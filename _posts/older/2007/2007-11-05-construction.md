<p>We've started exterior construction. We're expanding the lobby in three directions. The restaurant is fully open, but the patio and PlayLand are (obviously) closed. Interior remodeling is set to begin in two weeks. The McDrive will remain open during the remodeling, but the lobby will be closed. Re-opening with McCaf&eacute; is scheduled for the beginning of December. </p>
