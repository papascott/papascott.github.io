<p>It's now been four weeks since my <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/08/needles-and-pins/">herniated disc was diagnosed</a>, and I've gone through the first set of treatments. I'm not taking any medication, and we're trying to avoid surgery. I've been undergoing traction for my left hip and lower back, and taking acupuncture and TENS treatment for pain.</p>
<p>After four weeks, I can see it's going to be a long haul. The pain relief has stagnated, and the past week I haven't been able to sleep through the night. The pain itself it dynamic, the intensity ebbs and wanes, and the epicenter seems to be moving upwards. I hope that's a sign of healing, that the pain is moving to it's true source in the spinal column. This weekend for the first time I felt discomfort in my back for the first time. Until now the pain has only been in my hip and legs. I'm fine when I standing, it's when sitting and laying down that the pain occurs. Waking up in the morning (or the middle of the night, as the case may be) it takes 30 minutes to an hour for the pain to subside.</p>
<p>We'll continue the chiropractic traction treatments, they are what seem do the most good. I'm not sure about the acupuncture. I'm not sure TENS actually relieves pain or just distracts from it, but I guess on the whole it helps. I can see this is going to be a process of months and not weeks, and I'm glad our orthopedist is just a 5 minute drive. I'm also very glad I work at home... an hour drive twice a day would be pure torture.</p>
