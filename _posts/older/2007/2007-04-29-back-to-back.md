<p>In case you're wondering about my <a href="/archives/2007/01/08/needles-and-pins/">back</a> (my last <a href="/archives/2007/02/05/traction-times-ten/">real update</a> was in February), things are going pretty well. I've been pain-free since the beginning of March, although I do feel some tension or tiredness in my lower back from time to time. I've been going to a physiotherapist (my next-door neighbor), and she's been teaching me the basics... how to sit, how to stand, last week I tried walking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dr-wolff.com/"><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/dr-wolff-back-training.jpg" alt="Dr Wolff Back Training" title="Dr Wolff" align="right" /></a> Last week I started a 8-week training course at a local fitness studio. They have a set of machines from <a href="http://www.dr-wolff.com/">Dr. Wolff</a> to train the upper and lower back. The cost is covered by health insurance, and since we are supposed to work out on our own between sessions, it works out like a trial membership.</p>
<p>The best part is that since the initial injection at the beginning of January, I've taken absolutely no pain medication. I no longer have the TENS device (it was more a nuisance than a help), and I'm not taking any more chiropractic treatments.</p>
<p>My therapist (er, my neighbor) would like me to ergonomically optimize my workplace. Since I'm about to switch jobs, I'm not sure where my new workplace is going to be. I guess I'll have to work that out with my new boss.</p>
