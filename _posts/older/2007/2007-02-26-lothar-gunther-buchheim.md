<p>Lothar-GÃ¼nther Buchheim, the author of "Das Boot", <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/24/obituaries/24buchheim.html">died last week aged 89</a>. The film, but especially <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Das-Boot-Lothar-Gunther-Buchheim/dp/0304352314/">the book (in English translation)</a>, were very important to me  when it became clear that I would be spending a permanent relationship with a Ger(wo)man, and with a nation full of Nazis (so I thought). The novel shows the pointlessness of war, the humanity of the sailors, and the extreme claustrophia aboard the U-Boat. Thanks to <a href="http://www.dangerousmeta.com/?p=12347">Garret for posting the obituary</a>.</p>
