<p>Reuters, <a href="http://yahoo.reuters.com/news/articlehybrid.aspx?storyID=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20070508:MTFH92768_2007-05-08_22-50-45_N08197556&amp;type=comktNews">Shrek on a diet in McDonald's Happy Meal gig</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  On Tuesday, McDonald's and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., the studio behind the upcoming "Shrek the Third" movie, unveiled a promotion in which Shrek, Donkey and other characters from the animated film will be used to sell Happy Meals and other McDonald's food.</p>
<p>  But unlike previous movie tie-ins, McDonald's will use Shrek to feature its salads, milk, apple slices and other products ... A Happy Meal with Apple Dippers, all-white-meat chicken McNuggets, and low-fat milk will be featured in television commercials and on posters in McDonald's restaurants. Shrek will also appear on packaging for the milk and apples.</p>
<p>  While the apples, milk, salads and other featured products have been on McDonald's menu for more than a year, Chief Marketing Officer Mary Dillon said the company still had "opportunities to drive awareness both with parents and kids about these offerings."
</p></blockquote>
<p>Good! It's one thing to add healthy products to the menu, it's another thing to actually put marketing money behind them.</p>
<p>Cynics might say that McDonald's is only responding to "mounting criticism its food was not only unhealthy, but also contributing to the increase in overweight kids in the United States". I would say that McDonald's is responding to consumer demand, which I guess amounts to the same thing.</p>
