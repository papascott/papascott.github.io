<p>We're looking at new cars. Something roomy and practical but not too plain. The new <a href="http://www.volkswagen.de/vwcms_publish/vwcms/master_public/virtualmaster/de3/modelle/touran/ausstattungsvarianten/CrossTouran.html">CrossTouran</a> from Volkswagen has caught our eye. It's kind of a cross between a SUV and a van, but the TDI still gets 6.2 l per 100 km (that's <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=6.2+l+per+100+km+in+mpg">38 mpg</a>). The deep black with anthracite interior looks sharp. But you <a href="http://jalopnik.com/cars/news/more-rides-yanks-cant-buy-volkswagens-twincharged-crosstouran-219228.php">can't get it in the States</a>.</p>
