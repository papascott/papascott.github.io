<p>We're home from our meetings, which was indeed on board the AIDAaura cruise ship which was chartered for the occasion. We sailed a circle from Palma de Mallorca to Cannes and Barcelona, then back to Palma.</p>
<p>For our shore leaves we chose to take mountain bike tours. Here I am yesterday in front of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau_Nacional">Palau Nacional</a> in Barcelona. I'm smiling only because I don't realize that we're not even half way to the Montju&iuml;c castle. I later learned that sane people take a cable car to the castle rather than a mountain bike.</p>
