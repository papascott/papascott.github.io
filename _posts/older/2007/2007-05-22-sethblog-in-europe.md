<p>I've enjoyed following along with Seth and Holly's trip to Paris and London at <a href="http://www.sethb.com/weblog/">SethBlog</a> (starting with <a href="http://www.sethb.com/weblog/archive/2007/05/dday.html">D-Day</a> for their departure up to <a href="http://www.sethb.com/weblog/archive/2007/05/leaving_london.html">Leaving London</a> for their flight back home). I think it was their first trip to Europe, and it was interesting to re-experience looking at Europe through Midwestern eyes. It seems like they spent quite a lot of time looking for <a href="http://www.sethb.com/weblog/archive/2007/05/paris_day_two.html">Iowa-compatible food</a> (scroll to Tip #5).</p>
<p>On the other hand, we've been in Germany for 17 years, and (except to change planes at CDG or Heathrow), we've never been to Paris or London. So you can't call us cosmopolitan either.</p>
