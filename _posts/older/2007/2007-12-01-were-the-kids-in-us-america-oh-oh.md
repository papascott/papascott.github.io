<p>For those with an fetish for <a href="/archives/2007/11/16/is-ami-an-insult/">whipping an expired stallion</a>, Scot W. Stevenson (of <a href="http://usaerklaert.wordpress.com/">USA Erkl&auml;rt</a>)  has posted an updated text (in German, outside of his blog) <a href="http://www.possum.in-berlin.de/texts/us-amerikanisch.html">against the term "US-amerikanisch"</a>. I don't have much to add, except that maybe that the Spanish and Portuguese residents of the Americas also do not refer to themselves as "Americanos", and that a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hWZqllm3mQ">musical reference to Kim Wilde</a> is missing. A gratuitous reference to the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16389973/">poor knowledge in Germany of geography outside of Europe</a> would also be cute.</p>
