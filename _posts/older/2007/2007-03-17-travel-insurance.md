<p>We're looking at the cancellation insurance on the trips we've planned this year. The policy for our Icelandair flight is pretty basic. It covers illness or property crimes, and that's it. However, the policy for our Easter vacation ferry trip to Oslo has several clauses. Not only is our vacation protected against illness and crime, but also against losing a job, finding a job, starting a new job, having to repeat a failed test, or being drafted into the military.</p>
<p>That's right, if you're unemployed you can insure yourself against finding a job. Only in Germany.</p>
