<p>Last week in the Wall Street Journal there was a nice article on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117770922300685303.html">Why Franchisees Fail</a> (subscribers only, but a copy is <a href="http://www.franchiseperfection.com/blog/?p=92">here</a>). Even with an established system you can still screw up royally.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Weathering unexpected situations without a financial cushion can be problematic even for an established franchise. Ed Moran, an accountant in Tucson, Ariz., recalls a McDonalds Corp. franchisee whose dominance of a small California community was suddenly challenged by the arrival of a competing burger restaurant. The first year, the rival knocked 30% off the McDonalds stores sales. Unwilling to scale back on his lifestyle, the McDonalds franchisee instead reduced his labor overhead and raised prices. He went into a spiral and never came out, Mr. Moran says.

<p><em>Unwilling to scale back on his lifestyle...</em> that sounds like an epitaph rather than a sound business strategy. (In our business plan we still break even with a 20% sales drop.)</p>
