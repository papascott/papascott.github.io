<p>The <a href="http://www.radiohamburg.de/index.html?webseiteID=1550&amp;webcontainerID=9094">Bundestagkantine</a> radio show this morning (on the investigation of whether the Schr√∂der government hindered the release of Murat Kurnaz from Guantanamo) wasn't particularly funny, although the comment that "with that beard we thought he was <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/mdb/bio/T/thierwo0.html">Wolfgang Thierse</a>" was mildly amusing.</p>
<p>However, it was very funny that the next song on Radio Hamburg was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKVAV3qSb8U">"Coming Home" by Sasha</a>.</p>
