<p>O'Reilly Net: <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/sysadmin/2007/05/03/the-top-7-things-sysadmins-forget-to-do.html">Top 7 Things System Administrators Forget to Do</a>. I'll admit to being guilty of all of these at some time or another, but I try especially hard to avoid number 7:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Forgetting Courtesy</p>
<p>  If you want support from management, consider remembering that the user you offend today could wind up on the board of directors. Regardless of that possibility, system administrators should always remember that their clients are internal and if you want to keep your job, be good to your clients.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We can be smart and help people without being arrogant. It's more fun that way.</p>
