<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Glos">Michael Glos</a> is Germany's Economics and Technology Minister. He doesn't really understand the internet, but then <a href="http://blog.handelsblatt.de/indiskretion/eintrag.php?id=1167">he doesn't need to</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Thankfully I have people who operate the internet for me<br />
  <em>(Ich habe Gott sei Dank Leute, die f√ºr mich das Internet bedienen)</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that means his secretary prints out his email for him.</p>
<p>He actually spends most of his time protecting Germany's car industry. He doubt that he understands cars either, but he has people who operate them for him.
