<p><a href="http://beissholz.de/pivot/artikel-1463.html">Nicole</a> is looking friends on <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a>. Fine, I can add <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/nixande">her</a> to my list of contacts... but the playlists on <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/papascott">my profile</a> don't really reflect what I like to listen to. Here are "my" "Favorite Artists" from last week:</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/latest_artists_on_lastfm.gif" alt="Latest Artists on last.fm" /></p>
<p>Those are all childrens' stories and music. Christopher had school vacation, and he got a lot of new CDs for Christmas and his birthday. I ripped them all into my <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html">Squeezebox</a>, and we listened to them all. And, the <a href="http://slimscrobbler.sourceforge.net/">scrobbler plugin for the Squeezebox</a> sent all the titles to last.fm. Good thing MamaMaus has never learned to use the Squeezebox, otherwise my taste would be even more skewed.</p>
<p>I guess lists like my last.fm profile or my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/">recommendations from Amazon</a> are too stupid to realize when I'm listening (or buying) for someone else.</p>
