<p>Just to let everyone know that we were not in Minneapolis or in the Twin Cities yesterday, so we are not affected by the bridge collapse on Interstate 35W (<a href="http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID7216112_TYP_THE_NAV_REF3,00.html">Tagesschau report</a>) yesterday. No family or friends of ours would be normally commuting on that highway during evening rush hour.</p>
<p>However I know the bridge and the neighborhood well. It crosses the Mississippi between downtown Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota, and I lived near the bridge in Southeast Minneapolis my first two years in college. <a href="http://davespicks.com/">Blogger DaveP</a> lives in that neighborhood today.</p>
<p>Minneapolis like Hamburg is a city built on a river. You cross bridges over the river every day without giving it a second thought, taking it for granted. Thank God that due to road maintenance, only one lane was open on the bridge in each direction. It could have been a lot worse.</p>
