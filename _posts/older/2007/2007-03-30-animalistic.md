<p><a href="http://vanityfair.de/"><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/on-the-cover-of-the-vanity-fair.jpg" alt="On the cover of the Vanity Fair" title="Cute Knut" align="right" /></a>In the States we have Anna Nicole and Brittney, in Germany we have bears! Last year it was <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,k-6937,00.html">Problem Bear Bruno</a>, and currently it's <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,k-7098,00.html">Cute Knut</a> in the Berlin Zoo. He even made it on the cover of the <a href="http://vanityfair.de/">Vanity Fair</a>. I guess it's OK as long as the bears don't shave off all their hair or die of overdoses.</p>
