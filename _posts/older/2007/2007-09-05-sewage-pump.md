<p>Our German word for today is *Hebeanlage*, and what happens when it clogs up.</p>
<p>Actually, since *Hebeanlage* is a sewage pump, you can probably imagine what happens, and don't particularly want to know any details. So I'll just say that it was, and it did. And it's fixed, at least for now.</p>
