<p>Evanston Review: <a href="http://www.pioneerlocal.com/evanston/lifestyles/food/229382,pp-tibdits-012507-s1.article">Food background? yes and no</a>. A food writer for a suburban newspaper talks about growing up in a McDonald's household. Funny thing is we know her and her family. They moved to Arizona about the same time we did. They stayed, we didn't.</p>
