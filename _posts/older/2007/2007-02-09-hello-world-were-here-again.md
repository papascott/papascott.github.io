<blockquote>
  Cmon everybody do you want something real?<br />
  Cant seem to get ahead but its no big deal<br />
  Floating like a feather in a wide open space<br />
  Landing in a perfect happy place
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today is my birthday. I turn 45 today. But instead of you wishing me happy birthday, let's turn the tables. I want to wish all of you all the best today. And for the coming year. And for the rest of your life. Enjoy!</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I hear what I wanna here living on Cloud Nine<br />
  Jumping on a bed of flowers chasing the time<br />
  "Oh its a hard road" says everyone I meet<br />
  We cant trust the ground beneath our feet
</p></blockquote>
