<p>If you haven't noticed on the sidebar, I've been sending a couple of tweets each to <a href="http://twitter.com/papascott">Twitter</a>. They aren't all that interesting, since I'm either at home or in the restaurant, and I haven't yet gotten in the habit of sending tweets from work. You can also find me on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=666521280">Facebook</a>, if you're into that.</p>
<p>I have today off, though, and Christopher and I will be off on a grand expedition searching for mummies and dinosaurs. That's right, we're taking a day trip with the ICE to Berlin where we'll check out some museums and the Lego Discovery Center. We won't be home until after dark.</p>
