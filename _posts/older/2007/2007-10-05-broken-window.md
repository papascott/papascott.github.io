<p>The October 3rd holiday was good for the restaurant (it was like an extra weekend in the middle of the week), but it wasn't so good for our indoor playland. A child kicked out one of the clear plastic panels, and we had to close it down for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>We will be getting rid of the playland when we remodel next month (we need the room for more seats), so it's not worth the bother to properly repair. As I was leaving yesterday, a carpenter was putting in a round wooden panel so that we could let kids back into the plastic box.</p>
