<p>Yesterday I thought it was funny that we'd have only one car for 24 hours (Frauke will borrow her mother's car until her Touran arrives). Not anymore. This morning as Frauke wanted to drive to the bakery, the Lupo refused to start. The engine catches, but when we release the key it cuts out after 1 or 2 seconds. </p>
<p>We're now waiting for the tow truck from our VW garage to arrive and to arrange a loaner car. This certainly puts a kink in our plans for today. :-(</p>
<p>Update: Just as I was to post this entry, the tow truck arrived with the loaner car on board. Our business has been saved!</p>
