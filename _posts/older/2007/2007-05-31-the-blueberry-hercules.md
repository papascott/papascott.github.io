<p>Frauke found an an interview <a href="http://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/starbucks_aid_57627.html" title="Der Blueberry-Herkules">"Der Blueberry-Herkules"</a> at focus.de with Martin Coles, President of Starbucks Coffee International, on Starbucks slow entry into the German market...</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Germany is a great market for us. All of our coffee houses are profitable. We sell a premium product, and the guests are willing to pay the appropriate price.... There's a lot of room for growth here. No country drinks more coffee than Germany. We will continually expand. This year we will open more than 30 new locations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that means he's satisfied with a low number of premium locations, and won't be really competing with Tchibo or McCaf√© for market share.</p>
<p>BTW, the title refers to the fact that the best selling product at Starbucks is not coffee, it's the blueberry muffin.</p>
