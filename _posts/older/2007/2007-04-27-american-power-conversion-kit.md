<p>After seeing <a href="http://crueltobekind.org/archive/2007-04-16/useless_to_me_universal_power_">Nicole's useless universal power plug</a> that she bought at Heathrow (it doesn't work with German plugs), I thought I'd show our power conversion kit that we bring on all our trips to the States.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/474276106/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/221/474276106_4d469e7e92_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="27042007081" /></a></p>
<p>These jobbies cost me Â€1.50 each at Karstadt a few years ago. You'll notice that we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dremel">dremeled</a> out the safety tabs on one of them so we can insert cords that normally require grounding. Yes, these adapters are just like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed">Corvair, unsafe at any speed</a>!</p>
<p>These adapters don't converte the voltage, of course. We only bring along devices that work with 110 volts.</p>

<p>Combined with a German 3-socket power strip and our Hardware Hank UL-listed extension cord (not shown), we're ready for anything.</p>
