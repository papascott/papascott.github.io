<p>I had really hoped to make it to the <a href="http://www.jbittner.com/germany/2007/08/3rd-whiney-expat-blogger-in-germany.html">Whiney Expat Blogger in Germany Meet-Up</a> in Dresden this weekend. I cleared my own schedule and have the weekend off, but alas my time depends on two other schedules as well. I couldn't leave Christopher alone with Frauke on the weekend our construction starts getting serious, so we agreed that I would stay at home.</p>
<p>Too bad. I haven't been to Dresden since 1995, and I'm sure a lot has changed since then. And now that they've build the A14 Autobahn between Magdeburg and Dresden, it's a lot easier to get to. Google Maps says it's a 4:20 drive, and Google forgets that Germany has no speed limit.</p>
<p>In any case, I've tried to do some extra whining on PapaScott the past few weeks to make up for my absence. And once our McCaf&eacute; is up and running, maybe we can host a mini-meetup and invite some bloggers over for coffee and cake (sometime in the first half of 2008).</p>
<p>In the meantime I've registered for the <a href="http://www.wordcamp08.de/">German WordCamp conference in Hamburg</a> on January 27-28. One of my <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/GermanPermalinks">plugins</a> in the German WordPress distribution, so I might still have some street cred regarding WordPress. My free time is tentative, so I might have to cancel at the last minute, but by then our business should have settled down somewhat.</p>
