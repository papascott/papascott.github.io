<p>Which of the following explanations would you choose to define the term "milk crisis"?</p>
<p>1. There's not a single drop of milk in the house... the baby's going to starve is we don't... buy... milk.. RIGHT... NOW!!!</p>
<p>2. There are actually 3 liters of milk in the fridge, but since the shops are closed tomorrow, we might run out on Monday if someone happens to go on a latte macchiato binge.</p>
<p>This is obviously one of the many areas of disagreement in our marriage. As our ships passed in the night between shifts last Saturday, Frauke informed me that we had a "milk crisis" at home. I thought of Definition 1 (sans baby), and stocked up with 8 liters. She was actually referring to Definition 2.</p>
<p>As a result, a few days later we will soon be facing a "sour milk crisis", the definition of which I will leave to the reader.</p>
