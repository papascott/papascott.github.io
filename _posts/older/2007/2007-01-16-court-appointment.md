<p>The <a href="http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/">Shopblogger</a> writes about the trials and tribulations of running a supermarket in Germany and is one of the more popular German blogs. Today he explains about a <a href="http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/4651-Gerichtstermin.html">hearing in employment court</a> where basically an ex-employee was awarded back pay and vacation for hours she never worked. German employment law can be absurd (firing an employee is technically illegal, you can always be taken to court), and is the main reason MamaMaus no longer has a blog of her own (yes, she used to) and no longer wants to be mentioned here by name.</p>
