<p>Here's a problem you won't see at Web 2.0 startups. Our bank charges us for buying coins. The price is 20 cents per roll, regardless of denomination. A roll of 25 2-Euro coins costs the same as a roll of 50 1-cent coins. We don't get credit for rolls of coin we bring in. Of course the coins we use most are the 1-cent coins. At 20 cents per 50-cent roll, that's a good profit margin... for the bank, not us. </p>
<p>Strangely, we always have to buy 1-cent and 1-Euro coins, but we always have a surplus of 2-cent and 2-Euro coins.</p>
