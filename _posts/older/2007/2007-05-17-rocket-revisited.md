<p>Just to follow up on our <a href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/10/dreams-for-sale-4645/">uncanny sense of timing</a> in the stock market, 5 weeks after exercising a large (for us) number of McDonald's stock options at $46.45, today the stock is selling at over $52. I told you that would happen, it's your own fault if you missed out on the boom.</p>
<p>In other news, MamaMaus is giving up the first trappings of her life as a jet-set executive. She still has the car and the laptop with VPN access. The first thing she had to give back was the Blackberry.</p>
<p>Yesterday she was in her power suit at the notary and the bank to set up the GmbH. Today she was in a crew uniform working grill and fries on her first day of in-restaurant training (no, not in Dibbersen, at a company restaurant in Hamburg). Yes, her hands smell like ketchup and pickle juice, just like the good old days. Tomorrow she'll be in drive-thru. And, no, I can't get too haughty, my own re-training will begin in about 6 weeks. :-)</p>
