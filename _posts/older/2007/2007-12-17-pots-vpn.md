<p>Now that we finally got DSL back after 10 days down, it turns out the <a href="http://www.t-systems.com/tsi/en/30948/Home/LargeEnterprise/Solutions/Telecommunications/TVPN/1-TVPN">T-VPN</a> we are joining is a voice-service VPN, not a data VPN. I guess the Deutsche Telekom uses the term VPN differently than the rest of the world, which was confusing me (not to mention the fact that the whole transaction had to wait for our DSL line).</p>
<p><a href="http://mcdonalds.de/html.php?t=McCaf%E9%AE&amp;c=mccafe_wlan"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/papascott/image/upload/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/wlan.jpg" alt="wlan.jpg" border="0" width="180" height="211" align="right" /></a>Not that a POTS (plain old telephone service) VPN isn't a cool thing, it's just not what I was expecting.</p>
<p>It's also cool that our other Telekom issues at the restaurant were both resolved today. We once again have a T-Mobile HotSpot (with <a href="http://mcdonalds.de/html.php?t=McCaf%E9%AE&amp;c=mccafe_wlan">an hour free WLAN every day!</a>) and we have a DSL line for our flat screen TV.</p>
