<p>After<a href="/archives/2007/02/05/traction-times-ten/"> pissing and moaning yesterday</a> about my back, I slept through the night last night and feel pretty good today. Letting off steam helps (as does a pillow for the legs and new exercises).</p>
<p>Oh, and welcome to the new <a href="http://cutline.tubetorial.com/">look</a>.</p>
