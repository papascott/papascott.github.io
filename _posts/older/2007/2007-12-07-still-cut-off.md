<p>We finally got a confirmation from T-Systems... our DSL at home will be back up next Monday. I have no idea why a change of DSL provider requires a 6 day downtime.</p>
<p>I also have no idea why when I try to call the Telekom business customer service hotline, I always end up talking to a household customer service representative who cannot access any data for business customers.</p>
<p>In the end, our home office will be part of our restaurant VPN, so we'll be able to access all our restaurant data from home. It will be worth it in the end, I'm sure, but the downtime has been very annoying. In the meantime I've rigged up a tin can with a string... that is, a bluetooth connection to a cell phone with a data flatrate... so we can at least read mail and check our bank accounts.</p>
