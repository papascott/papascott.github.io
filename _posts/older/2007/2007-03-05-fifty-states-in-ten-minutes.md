<p><a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/state22.html">Fifty States in Ten Minutes</a> is a cute quiz to see how many states you can name in 10 minutes. I got the first 47 in three minutes, but could only add Idaho a couple of minutes later. Not bad for an expat, but I'm sure there are deep psychological reasons for forgetting New Jersey and Utah.
