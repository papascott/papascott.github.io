<p>The magazine <a href="http://www.stern.de/">Stern</a> is publishing a 24-week long <a href="http://www.stern.de/weinschule">wine course</a>, offering a <a href="http://www.rindchen.de/main.php?typ=K&amp;seite=sternweinschule">package of 24 wines</a> by post from Rindchen with an article in the print magazine and an online forum. According to <a href="http://drinktank.blogg.de/">The Drink Tank</a> (hosted by my employer at <a href="http://blogg.de/">blogg.de</a>) over <a href="http://drinktank.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=1682">6000 packages have been shipped</a>, including one to yours truly. I'm a little late to the game. I just opened <a href="http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/kueche/getraenke/579959.html?eid=580464">wine number one</a> and this is already week 3. I have a feeling this is not the kind of class where you want to catch up on your studies all at once (especially since MamaMaus is a beer drinker, therefore I have to study alone). As for the week one Bordeaux, the <a href="http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/kueche/getraenke/579959.html?eid=580464">2005 Camarsac</a> is nice for under 10 Euros, but I don't smell the berries, and certainly not the cougar cage.</p>
<p>Nice marketing gag... we usually don't read Stern but now we (or least I) will be reading every week until mid-June for sure.</p>
