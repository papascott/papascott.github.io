<p>From <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2065c45e-d65d-11db-99b7-000b5df10621.html">The Financial Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The UK arm of the fast food chain is starting a campaign to get British dictionary publishers to revise their definitions of the word McJob, a term the Oxford English Dictionary describes as an unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects, esp. one created by the expansion of the service sector...</p>
<p>  We believe that (the definition) is out of date, out of touch with reality and most importantly it is insulting to those talented, committed, hard-working people who serve the public every day, wrote David Fairhurst, chief people officer in northern Europe for McDonalds, in a letter seen by the Financial Times seeking support for the petition. Its time the dictionary definition of McJob changed to reflect a job that is stimulating, rewarding and offers genuine opportunities for career progression and skills that last a lifetime.</p>
<p>  McDonalds says it has an excellent record of promoting female workers and entry level staff to senior executive positions. In the UK, half the executive team started on the shop floor and 25 per cent are women.
