<p>WHen Mama and Christopher came home from Legoland last night, his first words to me were "Papa, you're gong to be upset with me!" I knew he'd be coming in with an oversized and overpriced Lego toy...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/1757193981" title="View 'CIMG0292.JPG' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2247/1757193981_fbefbb23cb.jpg" alt="CIMG0292.JPG" border="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Sure enough, he had an Imperial Star Destroyer from the Star Wars collection (Nico, that's item number <a href="http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=6211&amp;cn=240">6211</a> if you want one for yourself).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/1758049024" title="View 'CIMG0288.JPG' on Flickr.com"><img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2028/1758049024_c172008932.jpg" alt="CIMG0288.JPG" border="0" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Christopher muttered something about a reduced price of "800" (I hope he meant Danish Crowns and not Euros!), and that he'd be getting no allowance for 10 months to pay it off. I'm not sure, though, whether incurring long-term debt really enhances the pedagogical effect of giving children a weekly allowance.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm just jealous. All I got was a key ring. :-)</p>
