<p>Nico is hosting a <a href="http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3658">Gl&uuml;hwein get-together</a> at the Rathausmarkt in Hamburg tomorrow evening (Tuesday, 4 Dec) at 6:30 pm. By hosting I mean Nico has set the time and place, not that he's buying the first round. But I could be wrong. :-)</p>
<p>I'll try to be there at least for the beginning. How long I stay depends on whether Christopher comes with me or not.</p>
<p>We'll be at the Friesensch&auml;nke stand, which is directly on the left when one faces the Rathaus from the bus stop. I'll be standing next to the guy holding a mug of Gl&uuml;hwein.</p>
