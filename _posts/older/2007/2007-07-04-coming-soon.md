<p>We're still way too busy to catch our breaths, but I thought I'd show the "directional" sign we've commissioned. You'll see this when you drive into Buchholz on the Lüneburger Strasse, from Jesteburg. Since the McCafé won't be ready for a few months, we'll paste a "Coming in December" sticker over the McCafé logo. Hopefully it will raise some curiosity.</p>
<p>Since we'll see the sign every day when we drive to work, it will also serve as a quick shot of daily motivation.</p>
