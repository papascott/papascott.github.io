<p>If you are forced to listen to Volksmusik on your Caribbean cruise, <a href="http://www.margaret-marks.com/Transblawg/archives/002255.html">you might be entitled to a refund</a>, a court in Frankfurt has decided. In this case, 60 German tourists who had been promised Caribbean music were on a ship with 500 members of a Swiss folklore club. They were entitled to a 40% refund.</p>
<p>I wonder if this could a precedent to request a partial refund of the broadcast fees we pay to the GEZ. I'm sure we could prove that the Volksmusik programs on ARD and ZDF constitute <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment">"cruel and unusual punishment"</a>.</p>
