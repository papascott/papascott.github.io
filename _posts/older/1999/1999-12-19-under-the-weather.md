<p>This is the view from our living room this morning. Our backyard only extends to the fence; the horse pasture isn't ours, it's just part of our view.</p>
<p>I seem to have caught a cold, and I have a pounding headache. I'm glad I didn't have to go outside for these pictures! Even zooming in on the horses through the window seems to have worked out.</p>

<p>Even my PC seems to be under the weather. My 128 MB RAM chip sputtered out around 12:30 am Saturday morning, so I only have 64 MB left. It's feeling somewhat underpowered, even just using Netscape under Linux starts swapping to disk.</p>
