<p>Mama is looking at me instead of out the window at the neighbor's horse shed in back. </p>
<p>At my urging, my parents in Minnesota got a computer a couple of weeks ago and are now nearly in the Internet... they can browse web pages, but can't yet send and receive mail. That reminds me how hard the Internet still is, despite the attempts to make it easy. I'm sure their provider gives their new customers all the technical data that is needed to sign on, but that certainly doesn't mean that a beginner can figure what do to if (or when) something goes wrong. All we want to do is to be able to send them baby pictures.</p>
<p><i>Mom and Dad: That's Curly from the Three Stooges in the left margin. He knows how it feels to be connecting to the Internet for the first time. Just click on his face! (and make sure your sound is turned on.)</i></p>
