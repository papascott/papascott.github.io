<p><b>1 Jan 2000 2:20 am CET:</b> The lights are still on and we are still here! (the EditThisPage server is located in California, so this page is still date 1999 for now)</p>
<p>I celebrated the new millenium at Mama's bedside at the hospital. She came down with a fever at 11pm, so we couldn't even drink the champange I had smuggled in. All we could do at midnight was smile and kiss. Christopher slept through it all. </p>
<p>Christopher's jaundice had gone down, so he was in the room with us, not under the UV lights. Nursing went well today, too. </p>
<p>I now have a real name for this website! We've been calling each other 'PapaScott' and 'MamaMaus' for several months now, so it seems to fit. I hope the font for the logo isn't <i>too</i> dignified.</p>
<p>My mother asked why vacuum babies are more prone to high bilirubin. The nurse explained that the bruising caused by the vacuum is stress on circulation and hence on the liver.</p>
<p>I think I found a better place to keep baby pictures at <a href="http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumList?u=185392">PhotoPoint</a>.</p>
