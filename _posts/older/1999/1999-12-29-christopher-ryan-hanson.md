<p>For grandparents and other hardcore Christopher fans, we have set up photo albums (<a href="http://www.ofoto.com/i.cfm?m=938240102&n=2454059">Day 1</a> and <a href="http://www.ofoto.com/i.cfm?m=785480102&n=4898694">Day 2</a>) at Ofoto.com (they'll ask you to register first, and they only ship prints to US addresses)</p>
<p>Now that we have a suitable subject, I'm looking for the best way to share masses of digital photos. But Ofoto looks like a good first step, although they are a bit commercial.</p>
<p>Just for fun, I posted an <a href="http://x26.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=565792464&CONTEXT=946469562.1825701899&hitnum=0">announcement</a> for Christopher on the Debian GNU/Linux developer's mailing list: "crh is the initial version of a program that will eventually revolutionize the entire world. The functionality of this initial version is restricted to simple input (mother's milk) and output (dirty diapers)."</p>
