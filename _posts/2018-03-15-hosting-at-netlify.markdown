I didn't mention it when I moved away from[ GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but for the past couple of months this blog has been hosted at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a platform for building and hosting static websites. It works very well with jekyll, which generates this blog, and means I no longer need to build the site on my own machine to publish it. I just push my changes to my repository at GitHub, which Netlify continuously monitors for changes, and my blog gets updated usually within a minute.
