<p><strong>I don't use public transportation.</strong> Most novice expats will gush about how in Germany they don't need a car at all, and with bike, bus, tram, subway, commuter train, or whatever, they can get everywhere they need to go.</p>
<p>We do have a public bus that stops in our village. During rush hour it stops every hour, during the day every two hours. That might be OK for commuting to school or work (the times are coordinated with trains to Hamburg), but it's not particularly convenient for daily life. And since there are no shops in our village at all, not even a bakery, we'd be stuck without two cars.</p>
<p>That said, we do try to use public transportation to get to Hamburg when we can. But we drive a car to the station.</p>
<p>(This also reminds me of my favorite German joke: <em>Alle reden vom Ã¶ffentlichen Verkehr, aber keiner traut sich!</em> It can't really be translated, but <em>Verkehr</em> can mean either transportation or intercourse, so think of public <em>Verkehr</em>.)</p>
