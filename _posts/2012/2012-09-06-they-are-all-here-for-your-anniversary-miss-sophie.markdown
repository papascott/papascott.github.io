<p>Twenty-nine years ago today was the <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/09/06/">Tuesday after Labor Day</a> when, as <a href="http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/the-river">Bruce Springsteen put it</a>, "the judge put it all to rest".</p>
<p>These days we can only joke about how long it has been. We can still quote the <s>English</s> <s>German</s> (whatever) TV classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner_for_One">"Dinner for One"</a> to one another: "You look younger than ever, love! Younger than ever!" Of course, the line may wear out someday. If someday this blog ceases to be updated and you hear about a particularly gory family drama* from northern Germany, you'll know I tried the line once too often.</p>
<p>*Family drama (<em>Familiendrama</em>) is one of those phrases that in German means something completely different than in English. For us it might mean a TV show suitable to watch with your kids, or perhaps the "discussion" that ensues when a teenaged daughter tells her parents that she is pregnant. In German it refers to a murder (often a murder/suicide) within a family.</p>
