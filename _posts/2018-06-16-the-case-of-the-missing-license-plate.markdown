title: The Case of the Missing License Plate
---
Our son got his drivers license in February, and it's been a life-changerâ€¦ for him and for us! No more getting up at 6 in the morning to get him to the bus stop (we live in the country so we have to drive to the bus stop, at least the one to get him to his school). No more driving back and forth to the airfield on weekends so he can partake in his chosen hobby. Our side-job as taxi drivers was over.

Coincidentally (or not) in February I also got a car of my own, so (counting the E-Up as half a car) we have 2-1/2 cars available for 3 drivers. That works out fine. In kind of a reverse pecking order, our son usually takes our biggest car (Renault Kadjar, a compact SUV which just barely makes the grade compared to other parents' vehicles when picking up kids from private school) since he's usually pulling a trailer with a glider (which he organized for a few months as kind of a time-share). 

His Abitur exams started in April, so between and after exams he's been driving off to gliding competitions throughout Lower Saxony for days at a time.
