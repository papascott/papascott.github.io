        Alarm Clocks
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>We've gotten out of the habit of using alarm clocks. As a result, when I wake up I usually have no idea what the time is.</p>
<p>(No, this is not about how alarm clocks are obsolete in the 21st century and we use iPhones instead. iPhones as well as landline phones are banned from our bedroom. If you want to reach us in the middle of the night, you better bring the patience for us to hear the ringing from downstairs.)</p>
<p>It's not that we don't have an alarm clock in our bedroom. At last count we have four.</p>
<p>We have two matching digital alarms from that German coffee and gadget (and sports clothing and kitchen utensils and and and) shop <a href="http://tchibo.de/">Tchibo</a>. On mine the buttons are very difficult so it goes unused. My wife's is face down on the headboard. The clock is so bright that even at the lowest setting it casts the entire room in an eerie yellow glow. It's like one of those pods from Matrix.</p>
<p>Number 3 is an iPod/iPhone speaker clock my wife gave me a couple of years ago. It somehow ended up on her side of the bed. It has way too many buttons and goes unused. Also, see above about iPhones being banned.</p>
<p>Number 4 is an analog radio-controlled clock from precision clock-maker <a href="http://tchibo.de/">Tchibo</a>. It glows in the dark and shows the precise time. However, being analog, the alarm is not at all precise and can be set only at circa 10 minute intervals.</p>
<p>However, none of our collection of alarm clocks is particularly useful because from our bed we cannot see them. For one thing, our current bedroom furniture collection has no side tables but instead a headboard with wings, the surfaces of which are not visible from the pillows below. In addition, even if our eyes were equipped with periscope vision, we're both at the age that we cannot see much of anything without corrective lenses. For the purpose of telling time at night, any alarm clock for us is useless.</p>
<p>So if we awake in the middle of the night and want to know the time, we need to reach for respective clock (for my wife, her face-down eerie yellow-glowing Matrix digital, for me my little round radio-controlled analog) and hold it close enough to our face for us to read it. By this time, we're awake enough that we couldn't go back to sleep anyway.</p>
<p>I haven't yet even mentioned the most annoying alarm clock in the house… a TALKING clock from that electronic super-store <a href="http://tchibo.de/">Tchibo</a>. I bought it on a whim, but found the voice so EVIL that I immediately intended to throw it out… but instead it ended up in our son's room. He sleeps in a high bed with no shelf for a clock, so he puts it in his bed against the sideboard. When he rolls over in the night, he rolls against the buttons and suddenly the clock starts speaking: "THE TIME IS… TWO… FORTY-SEVEN!!!" Our son sleeps through it, but the rest of us have to put up with random squawks of clock logic until one of us goes downstairs and extracts the talking clock from his bed.</p>
<p>That we then know exactly what the time is in the night is no solace.</p>

    <p>John Gruber is wrong. I'm sure readers of Daring Fireball often thing he's wrong, especially when he talks about politics or the Yankees, but in this case he's wrong about fatherhood when he writes that when your son is eight years old <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/12/merry">that's as good as it gets</a>.</p>
<p>That's wrong. It keeps getting better and better.</p>
<p>Our son is starting to become an adult and think for himself. Of course as parents we're the ones he challenges the most with his new ideas, and they're not always right, but they're his ideas. He has my sense of humor and laughs at my jokes. He is an environmentalist and has a deep sense of right and wrong, and he is persistent in convincing others that his right and wrong is right for everyone. He's so smart it's scary. Just the past 3 weeks he's aced 4 tests in various subjects at school, even in subjects that weren't his strongest. He's sometimes a bit of a pessimist. I'm hoping to convince him that it's easier to change the world when you think you can do it. But even now, I'm impressed and amazed by him and I can't wait for tomorrow to see what he will do and become next.</p>
<p>And he turns twelve today. Happy Birthday, Christopher!</p>

        Four Days of Christmas

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Dec 2011</span>

    <p>We've been busy this month, as usual. When you have to the stress of owning a business, then the holiday stress that comes in December is almost relaxing by comparison.</p>
<p>But now the the holidays are almost here, we have 4 days to celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>Christmas Eve</strong> we'll to try avoid any last minute grocery shopping. We've have a simple dinner of Ragout Fin, then take Oma to the afternoon service at St. Michaelis in Hamburg, then return home for cookies, presents, and <em>Glühwein</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas Day</strong> is relatively quiet. No guests, just some fondue in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Christmas Day</strong> we're cooking goose for all the in-laws! Big Petersen Christmas party at our house. Presents and music galore (back in October the kids recorded a couple of songs for Oma which my brother-in-law has professionally mixed).</p>
<p><strong>3rd Christmas Day</strong> is Christopher's birthday. We're taking him out on the town for the new Sherlock Holmes movie, a last walk through the Hamburg Christmas market, and dinner at the roller-coaster restaurant <a href="http://www.schwerelos-zeitlos.de/"><em>Schwerelos &amp; Zeitlos</em></a> (Weightless and Timeless), where your meal rides on rails to your table. We'll see how that works.</p>
<p>Then it will be the 28th already, nearly time to get ready for New Year's Eve. Happy Holidays, no matter how many days you celebrate!</p>

        Unimaginable

    <span class="post-date">19 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>Lately I've gotten back to one of my favorite pleasures reading mystery novels. When we moved to Germany we shipped several boxes full of used paperbacks. These days with a Kindle, collecting novels is much easier. In case you're wondering, I've got Raymond Chandler complete ready to re-read, and lately re-read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vintage-Crime-Black-Lizard-ebook/dp/B0036S4EVE/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321642259&amp;sr=1-3">Blue City</a>, an early Ross MacDonald. Right now I'm reading the delightful books by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Cotterill">Colin Cotterill</a> featuring Dr. Siri, the reluctant elderly coroner in post-war Laos (think CSI-Vientiane).</p>
<p>It's a love my wife and I both share (and judging form how he likes CSI-type shows, our son will as well). There's something about the combination of the extreme and banal, the murder and the police work, that a good author can use to make astute observations about society.</p>
<p>Right now in Germany a real-life criminal case is giving ample opportunity for astute observations. A band of 3 neo-Nazis went underground 13 years ago and committed at least 14 bank robberies, 10 murders and 2 nailbombings. The facts have come out not through brilliant police work, but purely by chance. The last bank robbery 2 weeks ago was botched and 2 of the gang members shots themselves rather than be captured. The third tried to burn their apartment but turned herself in a couple of days later. You can read about it at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/18/how-german-neo-nazis-evaded-police">Guardian</a> or the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/world/europe/neo-nazis-suspected-in-wave-of-crimes-in-germany.html">NY Times</a>, or follow the sensationalist coverage at <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/topic/neo_nazi_terror_cell/">Spiegel Online International</a>.</p>
<p>This is particularly interesting because 1) the murders of foreign-born shopkeepers and the policewoman as well as the nailbombing in Cologne were high-profile crimes widely reported in the German media, and 2) German police and domestic intelligence have been particularly successful in infiltrating and stopping Islamist terror cells. Is German law enforcement blind to the right eye?</p>
<p>I'll let others answer that. I wouldn't necessarily call a conspiracy what could be sufficiently explained by incompetence. Noone is more paranoid of Germans being latent Nazis than Germans themselves. But if you read <a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a>, you'll know he thinks security forces concentrate too much on acts that have already occurred. They couldn't imagine terrorists that don't take credit for their acts, so they didn't consider the possibility.</p>
<p>Hopefully the result of all the political calls for action will be that right-wing violence in Germany will finally be taken somewhat seriously.</p>

<p>I was impressed by the view from our back window this morning. The lawn was frozen and the fog was thick and this leafless tree seemed to be spiting it all. It's November, and the damp cold should come as no surprise. The heat is on and we've started lighting the wood stove in the evening. The holidays will be here before we know it, and we're talking about next year like it's just around the corner instead of the distant future. </p>
<p>The fog is frozen and this tree is spiting it all.</p>
