<p>Here's a week's worth of documents, weighing in at 2.4 kg, for our accountant, in case you've wondered if we've done any work over the holidays. It's a bit more than usual since it's end-of-month, we normally have 1.0 to 1.5 kg per week. (Yes, it's all scanned as well, but we don't have a digital workflow with the accountant yet.)</p>

<p>We managed to return from our weekend and to escape without any long-term repercussions, so I'm sure it's safe to reveal where our destination. For the occasion of our 30th wedding anniversary, we took the ferry from Kiel and spent the weekend in Oslo!</p>
<p>Some of you will now ask us, "Hold on, isn't that the <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/09/08/oslo-cruise/">exact same destination</a> you had for your 25th wedding anniversary?"</p>
<p>Well, yes, 5 years ago we also took the ferry to Oslo. But it wasn't exactly the same the last time. For one, this time we stayed overnight, at the lovely Radisson Blu Plaza, a hotel that is, well, tall, with a lovely view of the Oslo skyline.</p>
<p>For another, we took a bicycle tour though the city with <a href="http://vikingbikingoslo.com/" title="Viking Biking">Viking Biking</a>, which was the perfect way to spend the afternoon, especially as the weather was nearly perfect (5 years ago it was cool and cloudy). It was very pleasant, low-key (central Oslo is relatively flat) and entertaining, and the tour highly deserves its <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190479-d2697659-Reviews-Viking_Biking-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html#REVIEWS">high rating on Trip Advisor</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, we treated ourselves to a 5-star cabin, and booked a separate cabin for our son. He could be Mr. Independent on the ship, while we had some time for ourselves. </p>
<p>Just to make us feel old, there was a concert by Soundgarden next door to our hotel. We were born 10 years too early to appreciate them, and our hotel was full of nostalgic 40-something fans all younger than us. Happy Anniversary!</p>

We'll be back Monday evening when we're sure the coast is clear.</p>

<p>All the talk of the "NSA Affair" in Germany reminds of a time when we were definitely spied upon by the German government.</p>
<p>In the early '90s we were visiting a relative in Bonn, which was still the German capital. We were exploring the government district and were admiring the <em>Bundeskanzleramt</em>, the Chancellor's office, occupied at the time by Helmut Kohl. We were outside the entrance gate, and behind the <em>Bundeskanzleramt</em> was an office building with the distinctive 3-pointed Mercedes star.</p>
<p>One of us mentioned how utterly appropriate it was that a symbol of German industry was looking down upon the Chancellor's office when suddenly the loudspeaker on the gate crackled.</p>
<p>"The Star of Bethlehem."</p>
<p>That was the absolute highlight of our trip to Bonn.</p>
