This isn’t for me, despite the title, but I’ll take it. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Future Is Now</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We were closed 11 days for construction, but now our restaurant in Dibbersen has been opened for 3 days as a “Restaurant of the Future” and so far we are very happy with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rdz-kiosks-061116.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt; The first thing you notice as a guest is the brighter, more spacious lobby, as well as the self-service terminals, or kiosks. There you can enter your order and pay by either card or cash. Of course you can still go to the cashier and verbally give your order just as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing you notice is that the cashier does not then go to assemble your order. There is a separate station for that, and you can either go there to pick up your order, or you can choose table service. You pick up a chip, find a table, and thanks to the magic of bluetooth we can find your table and bring your order to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third thing you notice is that all burgers are made fresh to order. This “Made For You” system has been running for years in the US, but is new in Germany. The heated bin&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where products could be kept for 10 minutes is now history. Our products are now made one at time instead of an entire tray at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were wondering how quickly we could adjust to the new system, but the first 3 days went very well. The kitchen is more organized and less hectic, and even it gets full we can recover quite quickly. In service our people enjoy that they now have time and opportunity to talk to our guests, and with our new look and new system they have plenty to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even I learned enough about the new system that I can help out in the kitchen without messing everything up. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Funny how in US English a bin is where you put things to keep, but in UK English a bin is where you put things to throw away. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

				<title>If Clinton Wins</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago Dave Winer wrote a piece about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/10/30/imOkayWithTrumpWinning.html&quot;&gt;Trump winning&lt;/a&gt;. So what if Clinton wins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be like the status quo only worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large group of Trump who feel estranged from the system will still feel estranged. This estrangement is certainly not exclusively American, see Brexit, the &lt;em&gt;Front National&lt;/em&gt;, or the &lt;em&gt;Alternativ für Deutschland&lt;/em&gt;. This group will remain and I doubt that Clinton is the type of leader that can win them back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republican party will remain dysfunctional, maybe even to the point that no Supreme Court justices will be confirmed at all. Look forward to more standstill and government shutdowns. The “Lock Her Up” faction will not become silent, they’ll probably become louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abroad, relations with Russia will continue to worsen and the conflicts of the world will continue, with new ones arising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, though, we’ll be pretty happy with it, because &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/10/30/imOkayWithTrumpWinning.html&quot;&gt;it could have been much worse!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Expecting</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;On this All Saints’ Day we are happy and proud to announce that we are expecting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, no, that’s not right… damn you auto-correct, we’re too old for that. No, we are happy and proud to announce that we are &lt;em&gt;expanding&lt;/em&gt;, in Hamburg-Harburg!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/phxarc-011116.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 1st we will be purchasing the existing McDonald’s restaurants in Phoenix Center and Harburg Arcaden. They are so-called satellites, located in shopping centers with a limited menu and low volume (about 1/3 the sales of a free-standing restaurant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already own the Marktkauf Center satellite in Harburg, and all three stores are just a couple hundred meters apart. Our store manager there will now have her hands full with triplets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we are right now converting our restaurant in Dibbersen to Restaurant of the Future (re-opening on Friday!) with Winsener Straße to follow in February, Frauke and I have our hands full too! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Done!</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;It took 10 years to build and is 10 times over budget, but the Hamburg’s new concert hall &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elbphilharmonie.de/en/elbphilharmonie&quot;&gt;Elbphilharmonie&lt;/a&gt; in the HafenCity is complete. The first concert is in January, but the builders handed it over to the city today.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Stupid Majority</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;This election is a good reminder of the basic principles of democracy: stupid people vote. Not only that, any democracy is ruled by a stupid majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. If you believe that you are of above-average intelligence, and who of us doesn’t, then by definition there is a majority of voters more stupid than you. And since stupid people generally don’t recognize their own stupidity, almost every one of us is faced with a stupid majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you are stupid, and you know it, you can rest assured that there is a smart majority out there to make the decisions for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the average person, of average intelligence, the average person has a great responsibility. They have the deciding vote. They decide whether the majority is smart or stupid. Our fate rests in their hands. May they choose wisely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they can’t. They are only of average intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are doomed to be ruled by a stupid majority. But that is not altogether a bad thing. All the political systems where only smart people make decisions have failed very badly. It is the stupid people who save us from ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And I bet you thought a post with this title would be about Trump supporters. Or Clinton supporters. Fooled you!)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Fifteen Years On</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/nyTimesHomeBombing7AM2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/nyt-110916.gif&quot; alt=&quot;New York Times Screenshot 9-11-2001 via scripting.com &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This screenshot from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/nyTimesHomeBombing7AM2.gif&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much how I first learned the the 9/11 attacks. A low-res picture on a news website from my office in Hamburg. 3 in the afternoon. The next day I was able to put my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/&quot;&gt;thoughts into words&lt;/a&gt;. More or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And next day came the headline in the Hamburg newspaper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/13/were-in-this-together/&quot;&gt;“Americans! We are with you!”&lt;/a&gt;, and at the same time, the first clue that the attackers came from Hamburg. All I knew then was that my country and world would never be the same again. I was far away, and grateful for the internet where I could at least try to fathom how the country I had left a few years before was changing. Without me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today. My son who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/16/sunday-at-home/&quot;&gt;was an 1 year old then&lt;/a&gt; is now 16, nearly an adult. My country started two wars in revenge that solved nothing, made everything worse, and haven’t really yet ended. Mission not accomplished. The current round of politics and presidential candidates don’t seem to offer much hope of any improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think I’ll just listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brucespringsteen.net/albums/the-rising&quot;&gt;The Rising&lt;/a&gt; a couple times through to remind of me of how I felt and how things could have become better. But didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Million Euro Overdraft</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;This happened over 9 years ago, I think it’s safe to tell the story now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my wife bought our first restaurant, she set up a corporation (GmbH) for the new business. However, our lawyer was lazy, or slow, or something, and for our start of business the registration of the GmbH had not yet been approved by the local court. No registration, no firm, no business loan could be paid out. With a 7-figure purchase price due that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem, says the bank, we’ll book the purchase from your private account, even though our account balance was more like 3 figures and not 7. We’ll increase your overdraft limit until the GmbH gets registered. No problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to this day I have a screenshot of electronic banking with an balance that day of minus one million Euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought that was pretty funny until we tried to buy groceries and our bank card got denied. We had to call the bank again to increase our limit a bit more so we could eat.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>1999.io is simple.  And simple.</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks I’ve been trying out &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1238.html&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/a&gt;, the new blogging software by Dave Winer. You can either try it out at his site &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.1999.io&quot;&gt;my.1999.io&lt;/a&gt; (you just need a Twitter ID to log in) or you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/1999-project/blob/master/docs/setup.md&quot;&gt;install the server&lt;/a&gt; on any system that can run Node. Being a server guy I of course installed my own (on a cheap 3.50€‚/mo VPS), and used it to write my last few blog posts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it because because it’s simple. And simple. Simple to write with, simple to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simple to write with. You just open the editor page and type. To update your text, you just click on it and type. There are some simple formatting options, but nothing that gets in the way. When you update, though WebSocket magic anyone reading your post immediately gets the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on the server it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.1999.io/users/1999io/2016/04/11/0004.html&quot;&gt;simple to work with&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no database, just files in open formats readable as text, JSON, OPML, RSS, HTML. Formats you can use for other purposes if you are so inclined. Even the HTML files for each post contain the JSON for the post, which I first thought was redundant but now see is brilliant. It’s like the web page contains it’s own DNA and can re-create itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These open formats allow one to do things with the output that go beyond the server. For instance, I copy the output of my server to an S3 bucket at &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.papascott.de&quot;&gt;1999.papascott.de&lt;/a&gt;, which can probably handle load better than my cheap VPS :smile:. It’s not yet coupled to my main blog on Jekyll (right now I’m using copy and paste), but I imagine it wouldn’t too much cleverness to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope someday to be able to use 1999.io as a blogging central, with the ability to send my posts to my blog, or Twitter, or Facebook, or Medium, or wherever, but keeping my original posts for myself. I’ll let those big silos show my work, but not own it.&lt;/p&gt;
