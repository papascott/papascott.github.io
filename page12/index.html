However it's been a hectic two weeks, full of major and minor disasters. </p>
<p>Construction chaos: Standard construction time is 12 weeks, and 10 weeks would be extremely fast. We were built in 9 weeks, and actually less than that considering the holidays in May and June. Coordination among sub-contractors is always difficult, and was complicated by the accelerated schedule. Everyone seemed to be constantly waiting on somebody else.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925270734" title="View 'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5925270734_939683fbdb_m.jpg' on Flickr.com"><img style="float:left;" border="0" alt="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5925270734_939683fbdb_m.jpg" width="240" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5925270734_939683fbdb_m.jpg" height="180" /></a>Telecommunications: The biggest disaster, and still not solved. The line was applied for in April, but it took over 8 weeks for our telephone and DSL providers (one is magenta, the other is red) to figure out 1) exactly where our site was located, 2) that we'd have a different area code than our postal address, and 3) DSL would not be available at the site until May 2012. It's perhaps a sad fact of modern times, but we can't sell hamburgers without a working data connection... specifically, to program and maintain our POS system. The situation is complicated by the fact that magenta and red don't talk directly to one another and always blame each other for whatever problems occur. The current status is that we'll get super-slow 300 Kbit DSL this week, in the meantime they cobbled a connection first with UMTS (3G cellular) and then over the landline.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925448352" title="View 'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg' on Flickr.com"><img style="float:right;" border="0" alt="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg" width="" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg" height="" /></a>POS System: As a result of the telecom woes, we didn't have a base POS system in place until 10 hours before opening with no time to test. The shaky data connection meant our help desk couldn't log in to us to fix the inevitable problems. The system crashed hard on close the first two nights. Our McCafé registers weren't properly connected to the system, and our Day 1 sales data for McCafé are gone. The operating system for the POS is brand new and pretty much undocumented. Our knowledge of the previous system is useless for the new system, so we were dependent on the help desk for setting things up for our requirements. Good thing for us the Easy Order kiosks did not arrive in time, that would have been just an added complication. Things pretty much work now, and we expect the kiosks by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Freezer: On Wednesday evening, Day 6 after opening, the refrigeration technician finished the final adjustments to our walk-in freezer and declared the installation for complete. The next morning the temperature inside was +5°C. Our entire frozen stock worth over 14000 had to be destroyed. Our logistics partner brought us a freezer truck to store our new stock so we could get back in business right away. The original installers were never able to get the freezer up and running. On Saturday a new firm was brought in, and the found and fixed the problem within minutes. The installer had literally gotten the wires crossed. The freezer has been at a stable -22°C for 48 hours, and we'll move our stock back inside today. Legally, the unit is under guarantee, and our costs will be covered by the general contractor.</p>

Everything that we did and hired ourselves, our people, the lobby and patio design, the landscaping, the PR and local marketing, that has all been nearly perfect.</p>

    <p>The front door already looks pretty good.</p>

<p>The lobby needs a little work, though.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5863520851" title="View 'IMG_0314' on Flickr.com"><img border="0" alt="IMG_0314" width="500" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5270/5863520851_523d645cd4.jpg" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>And this is going to be our McCafé?</p>

<p>I'll spare you the pictures from the kitchen. To us it looks like total chaos. But the construction experts tell us everything looks good for a week before opening. We're crossing our fingers until Monday, when we officially take over the site.</p>
<p>Let's take a look outside. We have a nice Playland for the kids to crawl through. Just yesterday it was still packed on pallets on a truck.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5864070584" title="View 'IMG_0311' on Flickr.com"><img border="0" alt="IMG_0311" width="500" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5110/5864070584_4efce48f59.jpg" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>And it's always good to have asphalt in the Drive-Thru lane before the cars come.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5863518763" title="View 'IMG_0312' on Flickr.com"><img border="0" alt="IMG_0312" width="500" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2769/5863518763_961f06be7a.jpg" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>But it seems the general contractor has some understanding for our logo. That's a very good sign!</p>

<p>But I almost forgot... the best thing is, our electric drive Smart has arrived. It will look better once we paste a bunch of Golden Arches on it! But we'll show it off on Sunday at our local Stadtlauf (city run).</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Pfingstbaumfplanzen.pdf" title="Pfingstbaumfplanzen.pdf" alt="Pfingstbaumfplanzen"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pfingsbaumplanzen.png" alt="Pfingsbaumplanzen" border="0" width="150" height="228" align="right" /></a> I've mentioned the <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/05/18/pfingstbaum/">Pentecost traditions</a> in our village in previous years. This year there seems to be a revitalized interest in village activities, for example the <em>Dorffest</em> was newly organized and was a huge success with 10x the turnout of previous years. Last week a brochure <a href="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Pfingstbaumfplanzen.pdf" title="Pfingstbaumfplanzen.pdf" alt="Pfingstbaumfplanzen">(<em>Pfingstbaumfplanzen</em> as PDF)</a> was distributed to all houses explaining the tradition of planting Pentecost trees, which in our area is unique to our village. Here is my attempt at a translation.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/14489364/" title="Pfingsbaum at Flickr"><img src="http://photos11.flickr.com/14489364_4e14656699_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Pfingstbaum" border="0" align="left" /></a>Dear Villagers,</p>
<p>  Since Pentecost is almost here, we would like to explain to you, the new residents of the village, the custom of planting Pentecost trees (<em>P?ngstbaump?anzen</em>) and to you, the old residents, to remind you of the history.</p>
<p>  The custom of planting Pentecost trees descends from an old tradition, in which the young men of the village, starting in  the year in which they are confirmed, can participate.</p>
<p>  They went from house to house and at the front doors of those families with unmarried daughters they placed a freshly cut young birch tree and sang traditional songs in order to introduce themselves.</p>
<p>  Today, in the time of single exchanges, personal ads and the Internet, the custom has changed.</p>
<p>  Today, on Pentecost Saturday the bachelors of Lüllau between ages 14 as 30 go from house to house through the village and place freshly cut young birch trees at the houses and sing traditional songs. After the song the eldest recites a saying. Then the residents of the house treat the young men to a glass of schnaps or a sum of money.</p>
<p>  Until Saturday,<br />
  Your <em>Pfingsbaumfplanzer</em></p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/05/30/pentecost-singers/"><img alt="pent2004.jpg" src="http://papascott-de.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/05/pent2004.jpg" width="320" height="240" border="0" align="right" /></a> On Sunday, the boys and girls come in separate groups as the <em>Pfingstvoss</em>-Singers. They also sing songs and get in return a sum of money or candy.</p>
<p>  These traditions are also documented in the Lüllau Chronicle.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We had schnaps and Mini-Dickmann candy ready for the men on Saturday, but they must have gotten behind schedule. We went to bed at 11 pm without having seen them, but the next morning the freshly cut birch was at our door.</p>

    <p>We had a chance to visit the new restaurant on Sunday. There's now security watching over the site, but he was nice enough to let us in for some pictures. Here's the front counter and kitchen area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5774215803" title="View 'IMG_0219' on Flickr.com"><img border="0" alt="IMG_0219" width="500" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5268/5774215803_cdfcb5d7b9.jpg" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Here's the lobby. The pipes coming out of the floor will be McCafé.</p>
