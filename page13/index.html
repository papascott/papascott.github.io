        The Plan Doesn't Come Together
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 May 2011</span>

    <p>Over Easter vacation our son flew to the US for the first time alone to visit his grandparents. It was only for a week, we drove him to Amsterdam (5 hours each way) so he'd be able to fly non-stop and not sit in a strange airport by himself. Turned out he loved it, one week was way too short, and he'd fly by himself again anytime. His grandparents are willing to host him anytime (of course).</p>
<p>Since we have <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/30/groundbreak/">big plans</a> for the summer, we won't be able to take a family vacation, so we're thinking that maybe he can fly back to the States for a couple weeks before school starts, and so that his grandparents (my parents) won't forget what their son (me) looks like, I could fly in for a few days to pick him up. So I started looking at <a href="http://kayak.com/">Kayak</a> for flight prices, and suffered a sudden attack of sticker shock. Four-figure sticker shock.</p>
<p>Between high fuel prices, high season, and new German departure taxes, flights from Hamburg to Minneapolis in July and August start at over 1000. Flights from any other German city are the same, and from Amsterdam is even more expensive. One exception was Icelandic, which has occasional flights from Hamburg this summer. They had a deal on some sites for 830, if you will willing to handle an 8 hour layover in Keflavik (which is I guess why the Icelandic site itself doesn't list it, and is not appropriate for an unaccompanied minor).</p>
<p>Trying to creative, I start looking at airports in neighboring countries, and see that flights from Copenhagen to Minneapolis start from the low 800s. Copenhagen is just 300km away, train there costs 30, a commuter flight about 100 round trip. Could that work?</p>
<p>The devil is in the details. The flights are in the morning or early afternoon. The cheap commuter flights are in the evening. The train takes 5 hours (there's a body of water in the way, so the train crosses the Fehmarn Belt by ferry), and with the airport connection would not make it in time for check-in. Taking an early commuter flight would eat up almost all the savings while making the trip more complicated (an extra stop with re-check-in).</p>
<p>We might just have to bite the bullet and pay the four figures.</p>

    <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>We've been keeping a secret for the past several months, and it can now finally be revealed.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bautyp.jpg" alt="Bautyp" border="0" width="434" height="274" /></p>
<p>We're pleased to announce that construction has begun for our 4th McDonald's restaurant! It will be located on the Autobahn A1 at Rade, the first exit from Hamburg heading towards Bremen. We expect to open at the end of June.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/map.jpg" alt="Map" border="0" width="466" height="405" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/limfresh.jpg" alt="Limfresh" border="0" width="331" height="212" align="right" />The restaurant with McCafé will be part of an Autohof, a truck stop and gas station, and our logo will appear on official Autobahn signage leading to the Autohof. Over 70,000 cars per day pass Rade on the Autobahn. It also fills a hole in the McDonald's map. From the west, the nearest restaurant is at Bockel, 44 km away. To the east, our restaurant at Dibbersen is less than 8 km away, but with the Autobahn crossing "Buchholzer Dreieck" between the two stores, they have completely different traffic patterns. Traffic from the Elbtunnel heading south drive past Rade, but not Dibbersen. </p>
<p>We'll be part of the LogPark Hamburg, a logistics center currently under construction on both sides of the Autobahn. We'll be located alongside the eastbound lane before the exit, so we'll be impossible to miss. We won't need an overly large sign to be visible from 2 km away.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/easyoder.jpg" alt="Easyorder" border="0" width="289" height="211" align="left" />The current standard building type in Germany features a green exterior with wood trim and all the latest energy-saving innovations. We've chosen a colorful "LIM Fresh" interior for an expected 130 seats inside and 70 seats outside. Among the extras we've chosen are touch-screen "Easy Order" kiosks to enable guests to enter and pay for their orders before coming to the counter.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/stromtanken.jpg" alt="Stromtanken" border="0" width="229" height="335" align="right" />A special innovation will the charging station for electric vehicles, only the 5th of its kind at German McDonald's. You'll be able to charge your battery with eco-power while enjoying your meal. We'll be adding an electric car to our company fleet. With a top speed of 100 kmh and a range of 130 km, it should be perfect for driving between our 4 restaurants.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/esmart.jpg" alt="Esmart" border="0" width="224" height="146" align="left" />We've been discussing the site with McDonald's for over a year, and we're very happy that we'll be open for the entire school vacation season this summer. The Autohof won't be completed until this fall, so things will be a bit dusty for the first few months. Right now we have the first big challenge: finding 70 new employees in a booming economy to be set to open in 10 weeks. Wish us luck!</p>

        Road Construction
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>Normally our village is pretty quiet. We only have 4 streets, none of which are paved, a couple dozen houses, and no shops at all (no bakery, no post office, no grocer, no gas station) other than a bio farmer who sells asparagus in the spring and Christmas trees in December. This is the usual layout...</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/gmap-luellau.jpg" alt="Gmap luellau" border="0" width="500" height="425" /></p>
<p>However, for the past six weeks the county roads going through our village have been under construction, and it looks more like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/gmap-luellau-baustelle.jpg" alt="Gmap luellau baustelle" border="0" width="500" height="425" /></p>
<p>The dark red is completely closed. They're building a rain drainage pond to the right and big drainage pipes under the road.</p>
<p>The intersection of the county roads is being turned into a traffic circle. One lane is available through the crossing regulation, only one direction can drive through at a time, regulated by traffic lights (dots).</p>
<p>Meanwhile a bicycle path is being built on the county road starting in our village and heading off several km to the north. For us that means the sidewalk is being widened and the street narrowed.</p>
<p>The end effect is that the traffic that normally turns south at the crossing redirects itself onto our cobblestone streets. It's not a marked detour, but people take it anyway, ignoring the no-trucks sign and the 30 kmh speed limit. (The road marked Sand is just a tractor path and leads nowhere unless you're an asparagus picker.) We can hear traffic past our house starting at 6am, just after the early-morning birds stop chirping.</p>
<p>The construction should be done in early June, and until then we won't be needing our alarm clocks.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The same day this was posted, the circle was opened to traffic in all directions. No more unofficial detours on our street! Hooray! </p>
