    <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2011</span>

    <p>Through soft living and not sticking to my gym schedule, I'm carrying 5 kilos more than 3 years ago and the suit I bought then is too tight around the belly. And the suit before that hangs like a tent. Why is fashion so unforgiving? But we have a gala event in Berlin to attend, and Christopher also needs the appropriate attire, so yesterday we were off to Hamburg to visit <a href="http://www.policke-herrenkleidung.de/">Policke</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.policke-herrenkleidung.de/historisches-kaufhaus.html"><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/02-01-11.jpg" alt="02 01  1" border="0" width="250" height="216" style="float:right;" /></a>I <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/12/11/advent-advent-ein-anzug-brennt/">blogged about Policke</a> 11 years ago when I got the suit before that. It hasn't changed much since then</p>
<blockquote><p>Mama was convinced that I needed a new suit for her company Christmas party next weekend (her first formal appearance after maternity leave, although she officially starts on January 2). My main criteria in choosing a profession was to avoid wearing suits. I hate buying clothes, but its even worse to discuss or even argue about buying clothes, so I kept my mouth shut (well, nearly shut) and went along with Mama and Christopher to Hamburg early on Saturday.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We went to Policke, an old-fashioned mens clothier in Hamburg not chic downtown Hamburg, but the nitty, gritty inner-city neighborhood of St. Georg, located across from a Turkish bank and some porno shops, between a mosque<sup>[<a name="mosque" href="#footnote">*</a>]</sup> and a Good Templars Club. The shop looks like it hasnt been remodeled since the 1920s, and maybe the staff hasnt changed since then either. Theres hardly room to move the tiny rooms are stuffed with suits.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Its impossible to browse. You are met at the door by the chief salesman, who measures your exact size by eye alone, and are sent to the appropriate room. I told the salesman there I need a dark colored suit for a Christmas party, he picked two out that both fit perfectly and met Mamas approval. I picked one, and we were out in 15 minutes, paying a least a third less than we would have downtown, and were home before the crowds arrived in the city.</p></blockquote>
<p>This time the service was even quicker. The first suit tried on fit and was right, so I was done in 10 minutes, and I paid half of what I expected.. Same thing for Christopher: 10 minutes in and out, much cheaper than we expected.</p>
<p>Even more amazing before we shopped, Christopher insisted he didn't need a suit and didn't want to go to any gala in any case. Today he spent 45 minutes trying his new suit on and admiring the look.</p>
<p><sup>[<a name="footnote" href="#mosque">*</a>]</sup>At first I was afraid the mosque was the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Mosque_Hamburg">Al-Quds</a> mosque where the 9/11 plotters met, but that was around the corner on Steindamm, a couple of blocks away. The mosque on the same street as Policke is the <a href="http://www.centrum-moschee.de/">Centrum Mosque</a>, and tomorrow they happen to be holding an <a href="http://www.centrum-moschee.de/images/stories/diverse/tom_2011_plakat.pdf">open house</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="http://papascott-de.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/09/s1poster.jpg" width="200" height="279" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" />II debated whether to post anything for the 10th anniversary of 9/11. I've pretty much written everything I have to say about it, either <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/">a day later in 2001</a>, or <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/10/five-years/">5 years ago</a>, or even just <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/09/11/inner-peace/">2 years ago</a>.</p>
<p>I was an expat American in Hamburg in 2001, the city where the evil had spawned, and perhaps I was much closer to that evil than I really wanted to know. <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/13/were-in-this-together/">"Amerikaner, wir sind bei euch"</a> (Americans, we stand by you) was the headline in the Hamburg paper the next day, and that was certainly comforting at the time. The only lasting consequence of that solidarity seems to be the military quagmire in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/16/sunday-at-home/"><img src="http://papascott-de.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/09/hhcandles.jpg" height="235" width="345" border="0" alt="hhcandles.jpg: " /></a></p>
<p>As for these candles at the US Consulate in Hamburg, I don't think you can even get that close to consulate anymore. The street is closed, last time I was there we had to go past guards in <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/11/02/terror-begins-at-home/">tanks with machine guns</a> to get in. Maybe that's all I need to say about how the world is different today.</p>
<p>All in all I'd just rather <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52mgnN9xfvA">forget that day</a>.</p>

<p>We've had our E-Smart (officially Smart Fortwo Electric Drive Cabriolet) for two months now, long enough to have had some experience with it. In short, we like it even more than we thought we would.</p>
<p>You can't just go out an buy one, however. It's not available for general sale. We're participating in a cooperation between Daimler and McDonald's Deutschland that lets us participate in a test of using E-Smarts in corporate fleets. We lease and insure direct from Daimler, and I won't mention the price since I'm not sure it's representative of any market price. It's safe to say it's our most expensive company car. (Update: The <a href="http://www.smart.de/information-service-electric-drive-fragen-antworten/6bf159ed-0c58-5c54-855a-84b62adfdfaa">E-Smart FAQ</a> at <a href="http://www.smart.de">www.smart.de</a> mentions a leasing rate of 700 per month, plus VAT.)</p>
<p>The basic statistics: it has a range of 120 km on a full charge and a top speed of 100 km/h. It takes 8 hours to charge a completely empty battery at a standard 220V outlet, or 90 minutes at a high-voltage charging station. The proponents of electric mobility say these limitations are not limitations at all, that 99% of daily driving can be done without having to charge away from home. We've found that to be true, and our battery has never gone below 50%. When planning your trips, though, you're always keeping those limitations in mind, and we make sure it's always charged up. It's also a two-seater, so family trips are out.</p>
<p>We've found the E-Smart to be perfect for those short trips where gas and diesel are particularly inefficient. There's no warm-up time, the E-Smart is always ready to go. We live in the country, our grocery store is 3 km away, the school bus stop 4 km, Buchholz where we do most shopping 5 km. We can make those trips without feeling guilty at all.</p>
<p>As for driving, it sounds and feels like riding an elevator or driving a bumper car. It has a one-speed transmission, so it never shifts gears, you just step on the accelerator and it goes. It will never win any drag races pulling from a stop light. It has air conditioning and a good (but not great) sound system that plays MP3s. And we can put the top down, though with this year's German non-summer we've done that exactly once.</p>
<p>As for the operating costs, we've got a mini power-use counter on our outside outlet, so we know that we've driven about 2500 km on about 350 kWh. However, that does not count charges at the loading station in Rade (it's still in test and we aren't paying there yet). We pay about 23 cents per kWh for our eco-power at home, so that works out to about 3.25 per 100 km, which I figure is about half of what gas or diesel would cost. So it's not only fun and ecological, it's inexpensive too&#42;. (*Not considering the purchase price.)</p>
<p>Are electric cars the wave of the future? I don't know. The car itself has no emissions, but power generating plant may be nuclear or coal, so you're just moving the pollution to where you can't see it. The high purchase prices make them uneconomical for most people right now. And I'm not sure how electric mobility fits in an energy policy that stresses conservation (particularly in Germany, which is giving up nuclear power). The future may be in hybrids, or a technology not involving a heavy battery. But it's worth trying out and thinking about, and our decorated E-Smart is turning heads.</p>

        Sanity Time

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2011</span>

    <p>Forgive me, readers, for I have sinned. It's been over five weeks since my last post</p>
<p>Our summer "vacation" was a busy as we suspected it would be. The restaurant in Rade, the truck stop store without a truck stop, is as busy as we hoped it would be. The self-serve "Easy Order" kiosks are in but are not being frequented that much yet (around 3% of guests). I suspect most people walk by not knowing what they are. Our first store in Dibbersen has been holding its own, down just a bit from last year despite having the brand new store just a few km away. </p>
<p>However it was our store in Harburg that gave us the nicest surprise. A couple of weeks ago we found our neighboring Burger King had subtly changed.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/non-bk.jpg" alt="Non bk" border="0" width="500" height="373" style="float:right;" /></p>
<p>It had become a non-Burger King. Apparently BK had cancelled their franchise. The restaurant is still open as a generic burger joint, but it doesn't look open and we're getting a surprise plus. Now we just need to get staffed to match.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we had sent our son to my parents in Minnesota for 3 weeks, after the success of his Easter voyage. He arrived just at the peak of the heat wave (110°F), but it was cooler at the lake and he pretty much caught all the sunfish he could get (final count over 60). I flew over for the last few days of his visit to catch up with my folks and bring him home. It was nice to get a couple of days of sanity time. </p>
<p>Today school starts, our son is in the 6th grade, and our schedule gets back to "normal", whatever normal turns out to be this fall.</p>
