   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt mention it when I moved from&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt; GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, but for the past couple of months this blog has been hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;, a platform for building and hosting static websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works very well with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, the software that generates this blog, and means I no longer need to build the site on my own machine to publish it. I just push my changes to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/papascott/papascott.github.io&quot;&gt;repository at GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, which Netlify continuously monitors for changes, and the blog it automatically updated, usually within a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also offers free one-click managed SSL, a global CDN, and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/pricing/&quot;&gt;free for unlimited single-user sites,&lt;/a&gt; whether commercial or personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlifycms.org/&quot;&gt;Netlify CMS&lt;/a&gt;, I can edit and post directly from GitHub and don‚Äôt need a local jekyll installation at all. But that‚Äôs a subject for another post‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Block E</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2018/01/19/block-e/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2018/01/19/block-e</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Foldmpls%2Fphotos%2Fa.119636488056535.13615.119633278056856%2F1658991434121025%2F%3Ftype%3D3&amp;amp;width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;613&quot; style=&quot;border:none;overflow:hidden&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been asked about my profile photo. Wikipedia has this to say about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic_Square&quot;&gt;Block E&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After 1950‚Ä¶ lower Hennepin Avenue became known as a place for drunks, crime, and prostitution. Block E was the center of the squalor. The 620 Club in 1971 gave way to Moby Dick‚Äôs, and became known as one of the city‚Äôs most seedy bars. Unsavory establishments, including rough bars, flophouses, and an adult movie theater settled in on Block E in the 1970s and 1980s‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By the 1980s, the block was one of the choice places in Minneapolis for punks to hang out and it became a creative breeding ground for the local punk music scene. Block E was also known for its cheap rent, drawing such establishments as Rifle Sport Gallery. From the mid-1980s forward, the Minneapolis police had a constant presence in the area; it was normal to see squad cars or a police van parked between the northbound traffic lanes and contraflow bus lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block E looked pretty much like this when I started college in Minneapolis in 1980. The owner-operator of the McDonald‚Äôs was my wife‚Äôs first boss, she  worked at the City Center location across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block E was demolished in 1988 and became a parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôd think in the current German coalition talks that the SPD could at least &lt;strong&gt;play&lt;/strong&gt; hard to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know German politics is a strange beast, but I would think that the SPD side more has more pull here. The Union is the side that needs desperately to form a coalition with Merkel in charge. The SPD never wanted a new grand coalition (so they claim), you‚Äôd think they could take or leave it, and demand a high price to take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, what do I know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lobby here has a more urban theme that fits our gritty part of Hamburg. I was worried it would be too dark, but the spots of color make it look brighter live than it appears in the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It of course has all the innovations in Dibbersen, plus we now serve ‚ÄúBarista Quality‚Äù coffee at the front counter, meaning that the espresso drinks are made with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wmf-espresso.de/index_en.php#coffee-machine-section&quot;&gt;portafilter machine&lt;/a&gt; in McCaf√©.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this future we need to take time to catch our breaths. Our 3rd drive-thru restaurant on the Autobahn A1 at Rade will join the future in early 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Future Is Now</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/11/07/the-future-is-now/"/>
   <updated>2016-11-07T06:03:55+00:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We were closed 11 days for construction, but now our restaurant in Dibbersen has been opened for 3 days as a ‚ÄúRestaurant of the Future‚Äù and so far we are very happy with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rdz-kiosks-061116.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt; The first thing you notice as a guest is the brighter, more spacious lobby, as well as the self-service terminals, or kiosks. There you can enter your order and pay by either card or cash. Of course you can still go to the cashier and verbally give your order just as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing you notice is that the cashier does not then go to assemble your order. There is a separate station for that, and you can either go there to pick up your order, or you can choose table service. You pick up a chip, find a table, and thanks to the magic of bluetooth we can find your table and bring your order to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third thing you notice is that all burgers are made fresh to order. This ‚ÄúMade For You‚Äù system has been running for years in the US, but is new in Germany. The heated bin&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where products could be kept for 10 minutes is now history. Our products are now made one at time instead of an entire tray at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were wondering how quickly we could adjust to the new system, but the first 3 days went very well. The kitchen is more organized and less hectic, and even it gets full we can recover quite quickly. In service our people enjoy that they now have time and opportunity to talk to our guests, and with our new look and new system they have plenty to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even I learned enough about the new system that I can help out in the kitchen without messing everything up. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Funny how in US English a bin is where you put things to keep, but in UK English a bin is where you put things to throw away.¬†&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>If Clinton Wins</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/11/02/if-clinton-wins</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago Dave Winer wrote a piece about &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/10/30/imOkayWithTrumpWinning.html&quot;&gt;Trump winning&lt;/a&gt;. So what if Clinton wins?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be like the status quo only worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large group of Trump who feel estranged from the system will still feel estranged. This estrangement is certainly not exclusively American, see Brexit, the &lt;em&gt;Front National&lt;/em&gt;, or the &lt;em&gt;Alternativ f√ºr Deutschland&lt;/em&gt;. This group will remain and I doubt that Clinton is the type of leader that can win them back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Republican party will remain dysfunctional, maybe even to the point that no Supreme Court justices will be confirmed at all. Look forward to more standstill and government shutdowns. The ‚ÄúLock Her Up‚Äù faction will not become silent, they‚Äôll probably become louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abroad, relations with Russia will continue to worsen and the conflicts of the world will continue, with new ones arising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, though, we‚Äôll be pretty happy with it, because &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/10/30/imOkayWithTrumpWinning.html&quot;&gt;it could have been much worse!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this All Saints‚Äô Day we are happy and proud to announce that we are expecting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, no, that‚Äôs not right‚Ä¶ damn you auto-correct, we‚Äôre too old for that. No, we are happy and proud to announce that we are &lt;em&gt;expanding&lt;/em&gt;, in Hamburg-Harburg!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/phxarc-011116.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 1st we will be purchasing the existing McDonald‚Äôs restaurants in Phoenix Center and Harburg Arcaden. They are so-called satellites, located in shopping centers with a limited menu and low volume (about 1/3 the sales of a free-standing restaurant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already own the Marktkauf Center satellite in Harburg, and all three stores are just a couple hundred meters apart. Our store manager there will now have her hands full with triplets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as we are right now converting our restaurant in Dibbersen to Restaurant of the Future (re-opening on Friday!) with Winsener Stra√üe to follow in February, Frauke and I have our hands full too! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Stupid Majority</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/09/23/the-stupid-majority/"/>
   <updated>2016-09-23T19:23:55+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/09/23/the-stupid-majority</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This election is a good reminder of the basic principles of democracy: stupid people vote. Not only that, any democracy is ruled by a stupid majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. If you believe that you are of above-average intelligence, and who of us doesn‚Äôt, then by definition there is a majority of voters more stupid than you. And since stupid people generally don‚Äôt recognize their own stupidity, almost every one of us is faced with a stupid majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you are stupid, and you know it, you can rest assured that there is a smart majority out there to make the decisions for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the average person, of average intelligence, the average person has a great responsibility. They have the deciding vote. They decide whether the majority is smart or stupid. Our fate rests in their hands. May they choose wisely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they can‚Äôt. They are only of average intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are doomed to be ruled by a stupid majority. But that is not altogether a bad thing. All the political systems where only smart people make decisions have failed very badly. It is the stupid people who save us from ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And I bet you thought a post with this title would be about Trump supporters. Or Clinton supporters. Fooled you!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fifteen Years On</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/09/11/fifteen-years-on/"/>
   <updated>2016-09-11T19:02:52+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/09/11/fifteen-years-on</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/nyTimesHomeBombing7AM2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/nyt-110916.gif&quot; alt=&quot;New York Times Screenshot 9-11-2001 via scripting.com &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This screenshot from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/nyTimesHomeBombing7AM2.gif&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much how I first learned the the 9/11 attacks. A low-res picture on a news website from my office in Hamburg. 3 in the afternoon. The next day I was able to put my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/&quot;&gt;thoughts into words&lt;/a&gt;. More or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And next day came the headline in the Hamburg newspaper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/13/were-in-this-together/&quot;&gt;‚ÄúAmericans! We are with you!‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;, and at the same time, the first clue that the attackers came from Hamburg. All I knew then was that my country and world would never be the same again. I was far away, and grateful for the internet where I could at least try to fathom how the country I had left a few years before was changing. Without me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And today. My son who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/16/sunday-at-home/&quot;&gt;was an 1 year old then&lt;/a&gt; is now 16, nearly an adult. My country started two wars in revenge that solved nothing, made everything worse, and haven‚Äôt really yet ended. Mission not accomplished. The current round of politics and presidential candidates don‚Äôt seem to offer much hope of any improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think I‚Äôll just listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brucespringsteen.net/albums/the-rising&quot;&gt;The Rising&lt;/a&gt; a couple times through to remind of me of how I felt and how things could have become better. But didn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Million Euro Overdraft</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/08/05/million-euro-overdraft/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-05T16:56:33+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/08/05/million-euro-overdraft</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This happened over 9 years ago, I think it‚Äôs safe to tell the story now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my wife bought our first restaurant, she set up a corporation (GmbH) for the new business. However, our lawyer was lazy, or slow, or something, and for our start of business the registration of the GmbH had not yet been approved by the local court. No registration, no firm, no business loan could be paid out. With a 7-figure purchase price due that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem, says the bank, we‚Äôll book the purchase from your private account, even though our account balance was more like 3 figures and not 7. We‚Äôll increase your overdraft limit until the GmbH gets registered. No problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to this day I have a screenshot of electronic banking with an balance that day of minus one million Euros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought that was pretty funny until we tried to buy groceries and our bank card got denied. We had to call the bank again to increase our limit a bit more so we could eat.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2016-05-05T08:43:01+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/05/05/1999io-is-simple-and-simple</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks I‚Äôve been trying out &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/05/04/1238.html&quot;&gt;1999.io&lt;/a&gt;, the new blogging software by Dave Winer. You can either try it out at his site &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.1999.io&quot;&gt;my.1999.io&lt;/a&gt;¬†(you just need a Twitter ID to log in) or you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/1999-project/blob/master/docs/setup.md&quot;&gt;install the server&lt;/a&gt; on any system that can run Node. Being a server guy I of course installed my own (on a cheap 3.50‚Ç¨‚Äö/mo VPS), and used it to write my last few blog posts.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like it because because it‚Äôs simple. And simple. Simple to write with, simple to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs simple to write with. You just open the editor page and type. To update your text, you just click on it and type. There are some simple formatting options, but nothing that gets in the way. When you update, though WebSocket magic anyone reading your post immediately gets the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on the server it‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.1999.io/users/1999io/2016/04/11/0004.html&quot;&gt;simple to work with&lt;/a&gt;. There‚Äôs no database, just files in open formats readable as text, JSON, OPML, RSS, HTML. Formats you can use for other purposes if you are so inclined. Even the HTML files for each post contain the JSON for the post, which I first thought was redundant but now see is brilliant. It‚Äôs like the web page contains it‚Äôs own DNA and can re-create itself.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These open formats allow one to do things with the output that go beyond the server. For instance, I copy the output of my server to an S3 bucket at &lt;a href=&quot;http://1999.papascott.de&quot;&gt;1999.papascott.de&lt;/a&gt;, which can probably handle load better than my cheap VPS :smile:. It‚Äôs not yet coupled to my main blog on Jekyll (right now I‚Äôm using copy and paste), but I imagine it wouldn‚Äôt too much cleverness to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope someday to be able to use 1999.io as a blogging central, with the ability to send my posts to my blog, or Twitter, or Facebook, or Medium, or wherever, but keeping my original posts for myself. I‚Äôll let those big silos show my work, but not own it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to build 3000 pages in Jekyll in less than 4 seconds</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/04/25/how-to-build-3000-pages-in-jekyll-in-less-than-4-seconds/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-25T07:24:47+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/04/25/how-to-build-3000-pages-in-jekyll-in-less-than-4-seconds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year I converted my Wordpress blog to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. My 16 years of blogging are now saved as text files which Jekyll renders into static HTML, which I then push to GitHub where the blog is now hosted. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2015/04/30/see-what-sticks/&quot;&gt;mentioned then&lt;/a&gt; that it took Jekyll some 3 minutes to render my 3000 or so blog posts, which is kind of a drag since the default is to rebuild the entire site every time even a small change is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, the latest version of Jekyll improved build times considerably. It can now build my 3000 pages in about a minute. But when making changes, that‚Äôs still too long to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, using a trick, I can now build those 3000 pages in 4 seconds. The trick seems pretty obvious to me, but I‚Äôve not seen it written up anyplace, so hence this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick, of course, is to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; build all 3000 pages. For older posts use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jquery.com/&quot;&gt;jquery&lt;/a&gt; to load in parts of the layout that might change, but leave the HTML file alone. For me, those parts are the sidebar and the recent posts. I build HTML snippets for those divs and load them in like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$( &quot;#sidebar&quot; ).load( &quot;/includes/sidebar.html&quot; );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, on the Jekyll side I don‚Äôt want it to rebuild posts from before 2015. I‚Äôve put all those in a _posts/older subdirectory and added an exclude: directive in my _config.yml:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;exclude: [_posts/older]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the HTML side, ever since I started blogging, even way-back-when with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/12/08/editthispagecom.html&quot;&gt;EditThisPage&lt;/a&gt;, my posts have been sorted by date. I need to tell Jekyll not to erase the pages I‚Äôve chosen not to rebuild (and it‚Äôs too bad _config.yml doesn‚Äôt understand wild cards)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;keep_files: [archives/1999, archives/200, archives/2010, archives/2011, archives/2012, archives/2013, archives/2014 ]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least ‚Äúarchives/200‚Äù covers an entire decade in one entry. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that‚Äôs it. When I do want to rebuild to entire site, I can comment out those two directives and let ‚Äòer rip. And being hosted at GitHub, you can see all my gory source files in the source branch at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/papascott/papascott.github.io&quot;&gt;https://github.com/papascott/papascott.github.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was dreamin‚Äô when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I lived in Minneapolis, I used to think we were cooler than everyone else because we had our own resident musical genius. That‚Äôs not true of course, but he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/prince-was-one-of-our-own-and-he-made-minnesota-seem-cool/376798251/&quot;&gt;made us seem cool&lt;/a&gt;. And even after he was rich and famous, he stayed in Minnesota. Most of the time, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now in Europe, even before last week I could say I‚Äôm from Minnesota ‚Äúwhere Prince is from‚Äù, and for a few moments I‚Äôm hip and cool. At least until we change the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe, even though I was just a casual fan, that‚Äôs why his death has saddened me. I‚Äôve lost a piece of home. &lt;em&gt;Ich habe ein St√ºck Heimat verloren.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day, I keep a copy of Dirty Mind (1980) on my current mobile device. It was my first Prince record. It‚Äôs an imperfect album. It‚Äôs sparsely produced, it almost sounds like a demo. And the lyrics, well, Prince was the artist for whom the term ‚Äúexplicit content‚Äù was invented, and they distract from the music. But it‚Äôs tight. Every note, every beat, on every track hits. Just listen to the 2nd side (this was back when albums had sides), with Uptown-Head-Sister-Partyup, beginning to end. It still blows me away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(My favorite track, though, is on the first side, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_You_Were_Mine_(Prince_song)&quot;&gt;When You Were Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. LoveSexy turns into a bat-shit-crazy ex. Both funny and sexy as hell.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Ants</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our house turns 20 years old this year. And every spring the same thing happens. The ants come into the kitchen for a few weeks. Then they disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ours is a good, solid German house, made of brick. But we live out in the country, and out in the country one has to deal with critters and creepy-crawly things. The doors and windows are tight, but there is obviously a crack in the outside wall to the kitchen. Every spring the ants wake up, get hungry, come inside the wall, and then maybe behind the cabinets, and find an entry to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year they find a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;¬†entry. I‚Äôve heard that ants have collective intelligence, and that it‚Äôs probably passed down from generation to generation. They are probably more intelligent than we, since every year we forget that the ants are coming. And then it takes us several days to find their point of entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we can‚Äôt think like ants, we have to wait until a whole bunch of them have come in so we can see their trail. Then we get out the ant spray, secure the entry, and wait a few days see if they find a new entry and come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They usually don‚Äôt. The spring weather gets warmer, and I presume the ants then find it easier to find their food outside rather than risk encountering ant spray inside. But they have the knowledge of how to get into our kitchen, and their offspring will use that knowledge next year, to find a new entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is this year‚Äôs point of entry, and our weapon of choice. We‚Äôre planning on renovating our kitchen this year. Maybe we‚Äôll find that crack in the wall and get it patched.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have an exchange student from Italy with us this week (his family hosted our son for a week last fall). We were a bit worried about how to keep him occupied, since we‚Äôre out in the country and far from the school. We needn‚Äôt have worried. The students (hosts and guests) hang out in L√ºneburg after school and they only come home to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, German is cool in that it was a different word for grade and high school students &lt;em&gt;(Sch√ºler)&lt;/em&gt; than for college students &lt;em&gt;(Studenten)&lt;/em&gt;. We‚Äôre talking about &lt;em&gt;Sch√ºler&lt;/em&gt; here. And that my wife and I met when she was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/17/and-i-saw-her-standing-there/&quot;&gt;exchange student&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Sch√ºler)&lt;/em&gt; in Minnesota is totally beside the point!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Where and For Whom to Vote</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/02/19/where-and-for-whom-to-vote/"/>
   <updated>2016-02-19T16:48:02+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2016/02/19/where-and-for-whom-to-vote</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Rogers&quot;&gt;Will Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, I am proud to not be a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And true to that spirit, as a Democrat living outside the United States, for the current presidential campaign I not only have to decide for whom to vote, but also where. (For my foreign readers following the US election, yes the process is complicated, and my description will make the impression that it is even more complicated. That is deliberate on my part.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can vote (in my last state of residence) in the Arizona presidential primary on March 22 (which, by the way, is not a primary but instead a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azsos.gov/elections/voting-election/election-information&quot;&gt;presidential preference election&lt;/a&gt;, since the actual primary for state and local candidates is in August). However, the Democrats have an organization for Democrats living abroad (called, appropriately enough, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democratsabroad.org/&quot;&gt;Democrats Abroad&lt;/a&gt;) which is entitled to send delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Eight of those delegates are superdelegates, beholden to no one but themselves, but thirteen delegates are pledged. And to choose those pledged delegates, they hold the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democratsabroad.org/the_global_presidential_primary_is_now_vote&quot;&gt;Democrats Abroad Global Presidential Primary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like in an official presidential primary (or preference election), I can even go to a real polling place to vote. In Hamburg! On March 5! At the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democratsabroad.org/848/hamburg_global_presidential_primary&quot;&gt;Friedrich Ebert Stiftung on Rathausmarkt!&lt;/a&gt; (hold on, are we in cahoots with the German SPD on this?) Or at a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democratsabroad.org/bseebach/democrats_abroad_germany_global_primary_locations&quot;&gt;other locations in Germany&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/democratsabroad/pages/4823/attachments/original/1454667653/VotingCenters2016.pdf&quot;&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt;. If wasn‚Äôt already a member of Democrats Abroad, I could join on-site at the polling place. If I couldn‚Äôt make it to a polling place, I could vote remotely, by email, fax or snail mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I could vote in my former home state of Arizona, it makes more sense for me to vote in the global primary, since we Americans abroad have unique issues for our candidates to be aware of (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/ustaxes.html&quot;&gt;taxation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act&quot;&gt;FATCA&lt;/a&gt;, and taxation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I know where I will vote. Now I just have to decide for whom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In all fairness, there is also an organization for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/republicansoverseas/&quot;&gt;Republicans abroad&lt;/a&gt;, but you guys don‚Äôt get a primary. You‚Äôre not even officially part of the Republican party. Sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>25 Years</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2015/09/01/25-years/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2015/09/01/25-years</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another half decade, another milestone. Just five years ago I was waxing poetic about &lt;a href=&quot;/archives/2010/09/01/it-was-twenty-years-ago-today/&quot;&gt;how we had already been in Germany for 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, and now it‚Äôs already been 25 years. Strangely enough my passport from then bears no entry stamp for 1 September 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time our entry into Germany was uncertain. Reunification was in the air, everyone knew it was coming, but the details were still being negotiated behind closed doors. We boarded our plane to Frankfurt on 31 August without knowing our fate. Luckily for us, while our plane was in the air, the ‚ÄúEinigungsvertrag‚Äù was signed by BRD Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble and DDR State Secretary G√ºnter Krause, clearing the way for our entry into the soon-to-be unified Germany the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Bilder/Bildstrecken/Mediathek/Bildergalerien/Bewegte_Zeiten/Galerie01_11.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Bilder/Bildstrecken/Mediathek/Bildergalerien/Bewegte_Zeiten/Galerie01_11.jpg?__blob=normal&amp;amp;v=4&quot; alt=&quot;Einigungsvertrag 31-Aug-1990&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That document did however leave several details open. It never was determined whether our cats would remain American citizens or whether they would obtain German citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Taking your Place</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2015/05/25/taking-your-place/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2015/05/25/taking-your-place</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For our son‚Äôs Confirmation yesterday I gave a toast that went quite well. It sums up pretty well how I feel right now about our son and parenting, so I‚Äôve modified it a bit and posted it. I wrote it in English so my mother could follow along, but I gave it in German, translating on my feet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd like to take this chance to talk directly to you, my son. This is one of the few chances that I know you‚Äôll be listening. At church the pastor talked about how Confirmation is a decision, an active decision, that you make. It is also an positive action‚Ä¶ you are finding and &lt;em&gt;taking your place&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are of course &lt;em&gt;taking your place in the church&lt;/em&gt;. We were all just there, of course. The church is a human institution, of course, it is not perfect. But the humans in the church usually do the best they can. And the church has been around a couple of thousand years‚Ä¶ if you have a question or a problem, chances are someone has come to the church with that before and it can give you advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmation is also a family event. They have all come to celebrate not so much because they are interested in your faith but because you are &lt;em&gt;taking your place in your family&lt;/em&gt;. Confirmation has played a role in both our families, in Germany and in the US, and is something that binds them both. It is a family milestone, a sign of a new generation, and time and life moves on as it always has. Time only moves in one direction and at one speed. It always gets to its destination, even when we want to take detours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rural Germany Confirmation is also a community event, much more so than in the US. It is the line you cross to become an adult. For your parents our town is a place we moved to, but for you it is where you grew up, your home, your &lt;em&gt;Heimat&lt;/em&gt;. And now you will be &lt;em&gt;taking your place in your community&lt;/em&gt;. You will no longer sing for candy on Pentecost, but plant trees with the young men. Later you can graduate from the youth fire dept to take responsibility for your community with the active fire dept. A hometown is something precious. A place where you can put down roots, find your peace, a place to belong. Your older relatives can tell what it is like to lose your hometown, your &lt;em&gt;Heimat&lt;/em&gt;. It is something to be cherished in your heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you are &lt;em&gt;taking your place in world&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike in our town, in reality becoming an adult is not a solid line to be crossed. It‚Äôs a process that you have now started, and maybe never ends, and process that you are now taking over for yourself. For your parents it means that we have taught you pretty much even thing we can, we cannot ‚Äúraise‚Äù you anymore. We can‚Äôt tell you anything anymore, as you remind us when we try to say something you disagree with. We have to start letting go, to stop setting rules and instead give advice and let you make your own mistakes. We are very happy and very proud for what you are and what you will become. I am certain that you have the qualities for success, in every sense of the word. Your self-confidence, your sense of fairness, your intelligence and stubbornness‚Ä¶ a positive stubbornness, I should point out. It‚Äôs OK to dream big, that‚Äôs the only way big dreams can come true, just have a flight plan filed, just in case. As pilots say, flying is the second most exciting thing in life. The most exciting thing is landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is your day. Cheers, &lt;em&gt;Prost&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;auf Dich&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>See What Sticks</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2015/04/30/see-what-sticks/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2015/04/30/see-what-sticks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So now that I‚Äôve &lt;a href=&quot;/archives/2015/04/23/transition/&quot;&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; my blogging platform, I have something to blog about: my new blogging platform!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the WordPress eXtended RSS file of the contents of my blog I found I had exported 3273 posts. Jekyll re-renders every post every time a change is made‚Ä¶ on the default template it takes 3 minutes, but on the Lanyon template it ran over 20 minutes before I cancelled the build. That‚Äôs why I started with only a few dozen posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then changed my archive strategy, using yearly and monthly archives similar to what I had used with WordPress instead of the pagination used in Lanyon, and lo and behold the build took only 2.5 minutes. The disadvantage is that GitHub won‚Äôt run the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives&quot;&gt;jekyll-archives&lt;/a&gt; plugin for me, so I have to render the site locally and push the rendered HTML to GitHub. I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question was whether Google (and everyone else) could find the old links on the new site. Jekyll is able to use the same &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;archives/:year/:month/:day/:title/&lt;/code&gt; permalink stucture I was using before. But were all my links the same as before? Do they all still work? Well, that eXtended RSS file contains all the permalinks that WordPress had generated‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;link&amp;gt;http://papasc.home/archives/1999/12/05/it-worked/&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;link&amp;gt;http://papasc.home/archives/1999/12/06/week-37/&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;link&amp;gt;http://papasc.home/archives/1999/12/07/ready-and-waiting/&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;link&amp;gt;http://papasc.home/archives/1999/12/09/linux-fever/&amp;lt;/link&amp;gt;
 ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes, that‚Äôs a fake URL. My hoster timed out producing the eXtended RSS file so I had to use a local install.) I then ran the links through a shell script I found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25135347/how-to-check-status-of-urls-from-text-file-using-bash-shell-script&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

   <title>Transition</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So maybe you noticed, maybe you didn‚Äôt, but this blog looks a little bit different than a week ago. Behind the scenes it looks a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; different. After over a decade of blogging on WordPress (I actually started using its predecessor &lt;a href=&quot;http://cafelog.com/&quot;&gt;B2&lt;/a&gt; in 2002), I‚Äôm now on the static site generator jekyll. My posts have been exported to text files. No more mysql database, no PHP, no more web interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So everything is new and things are still broken. I don‚Äôt have all posts imported yet, I‚Äôm only back to 2012 and not 1999 when this thing started. There are a lot a worthless one-line posts from the olden days, since back then we didn‚Äôt have Twitter and Facebook yet for worthless posts. So I have some work to do. But I‚Äôm looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design, however, is absolutely fabulous, even on mobile, and for that I can take absolutely no credit. It‚Äôs the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lanyon.getpoole.com/&quot;&gt;lanyon&lt;/a&gt; theme for jekyll by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mdo&quot;&gt;@mdo&lt;/a&gt;, who co-wrote (Twitter) &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, and I thank him for making his work available to us mere mortals.&lt;/p&gt;

Last week we bought a confirmation suit. Of course we went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://policke1.p2-men.de/&quot;&gt;Policke&lt;/a&gt; in Hamburg. It‚Äôs the perfect place for young (or older) men to shop. It has the feel of a 1920s haberdasher, full of dark little rooms connected by narrow halls and staircases. You‚Äôre met at the front door by the head sizer, who determines your size with a glance and with a slight movement of his eyes directs you to the room where your size is stocked. Once there, you nod at the salesman (they‚Äôre all men), who from your nod determines the style and price range you want. You‚Äôre in and out in 10 minutes. No words are necessary at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not quite. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confirmation will be at the end of May, on Pentecost Sunday. My mother will be flying in from the US. My father won‚Äôt be there, of course.  He made a huge impression on his grandson, though, despite living an ocean and thousands of miles away. He thought of his grandfather when he chose his confirmation verse*. We also legally added his grandfather‚Äôs name as an additional middle name for him. He will carry his grandfather‚Äôs name the rest of his life, and he will be confirmed with it next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess my father will be there after all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It took me nearly two years, but I finally did it. I was able to get the better of Facebook. Yesterday I was able to celebrate my birthday without a single greeting on social media, even if my wife very nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/papascott/posts/10152947844446281y&quot;&gt;gave me away&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was heaven! It was bliss! I was living free of the distractions of the digital world, if only for one day. My day! For me, me alone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope your day was a good one too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Where Were You?</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2014/11/09/where-were-you</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Where was I 25 years ago as the Berlin Wall fell? I must confess, I don't remember exactly. If I had known the news would radically change our lives, I might have paid more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't realize it at the time, but our lives in November 1989 were &quot;in between&quot;. In between jobs, in between continents, in between everything. We had just moved to Arizona, following her old boss who didn't have a job for her yet. I was working temp jobs hoping to find something permanent (one of them eventually did). We thought Arizona would become our home. We were in love with the desert, the sun, the lifestyle, everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had, however, picked a horrible time to move to Arizona. The savings and loan crisis had broken out, and the economy was already stagnant. And in the weeks and months that followed, the soon-to-be-reunified Germany became more attractive to us. We thought we could work there for a couple years and come back when the job climate in Arizona was better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where was I when I heard the news? Today I have no idea. In my car listening to NPR? At home watching CNN? With my wife when she got a call from her Hungarian friend Gabi? I just know that less than 10 months later, we were here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently &quot;between the continents&quot;, so to speak. I returned yesterday from the US, and fly today to Dubrovnik for 4 days on business. I still have some thoughts on the past week, the funeral, the Midwestern traditions, and the hotdish. I'll share them once I get the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My father died Thursday morning, age 81. I wasn't there yet, I had only made it as far as London. He was always impatient, he never liked waiting for anyone when he was ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not like we weren't ready for this. He's been on oxygen for 11 years, at first only at night, and later 24 hours. I always wondered how I would feel when the time came. Now I know. I feel his absence. Absence, as in the opposite of presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm home with my mother and brother to together go through the rituals. We spoke with the funeral home yesterday, made the decisions, gave details for the obituary, looked at the plot, picked out flowers. Viewing is Sunday afternoon, prayer service that evening, funeral 10:30 Monday morning. We tried to do things to make it informal and not all too a somber and sad affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zahrbockfuneralhome.com/obituaries.php&quot;&gt;obituary will be online&lt;/a&gt;. That's a thing now I guess. If you have Flash music will play, you may want to turn it down first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our son arrives from Germany today. He brought his bagpipes. I hope he's up to playing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We decided to spend some money on ourselves rather than the business for a change. When we built our house back in 1996, when we got to designing the bathroom we had run out of both money and imagination. We ended with boring hospital-white. We* tore everything out, replaced and rearranged the fixtures, threw out the tub, built a new wall, replaced the door and window, and installed a walk-in spa-like shower. After two and half weeks without a bath, it's done enough that we can use it. We're missing a few details yet, like towel hooks, toilet paper dispenser, mirrors, and cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Of course, &quot;we did&quot; actually means &quot;we hired professionals to do&quot;, but we did build the Ikea Godmorgen sink cabinet ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Phone Tricks 2014</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2014/03/31/phone-tricks-2014/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-31T07:20:30+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2014/03/31/phone-tricks-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To keep in touch with home I find it handy to have an US phone number. We never got in the habit of using Skype; a cordless phone is just a lot handier than turning on the PC. For a while I had a US Skype Number with a Minnesota area code. However, at ‚Ç¨5 a month it's not that cheap, and worse, my parents were not able to reach the number from their cell phones. And if I forward the calls to our regular German number, I pay Skype rates for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did some hunting around, and discovered the VOIP provider &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anveo.com/consumer/default.asp&quot;&gt;Anveo&lt;/a&gt; offers US numbers pay-as-you-go for $2 a month (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anveo.com/consumer/mainphonenumbers.asp&quot;&gt;&quot;Personal Unlimited&quot;&lt;/a&gt; plan). You can then forward the calls to a regular number at their normal rates, but since we have VOIP at home anyway, I just set them up as an additional account and pay nothing. Calls to the US cost $0.01 per minute, slightly cheaper than our main provider. They have servers in both the US and Germany. We've been with them for 2 months, and they seem to work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're wondering, our main VOIP (for home and home office) is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sipgate.de/team/voip&quot;&gt;Sipgate Team&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004U6NTXU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1638&amp;amp;creative=19454&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004U6NTXU&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=papascott-21&quot;&gt;Gigaset C610 IP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//ir-de.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=papascott-21&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=3&amp;amp;a=B004U6NTXU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt; base station. I tried first with a Fritz Box, but never managed to get it working reliably, probably because the Fritz Box was not our router, but behind our router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other trick to plan mobile phone and data for our visits to the US. Prepaid credit expires quickly in the States, so if you're there just once or twice a year it's likely cheapest to set up something new each year. This year we're trying service from &lt;a href=&quot;http://goredpocket.com/&quot;&gt;Red Pocket&lt;/a&gt; sold by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reisesim.de/&quot;&gt;ReiseSIM.de&lt;/a&gt; in Germany. The SIMs are pre-activated, you can add credit before your trip, and you can dial direct without going through a gateway to call Germany. Calls are $0.10/min in the US and $0.11/min to Germany. Network is ATT, and for the data plans &lt;a href=&quot;http://goredpocket.com/plans#gsmt-mi&quot;&gt;&quot;tethering is encouraged&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (that was our mistake last year, no tethering, and we constantly fought over the one tablet with internet). Our son will be taking a phone on his Easter trip to Minnesota, and we're in Orlando for business at the end of April, so we'll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years have gone by, the lease has expired on our Volkswagen Sharan mini-van, and it's time for something new. The Sharan was way too big for us. We thought we could use the extra space for our business, but in the 3 years we transported 8 passengers exactly one time. In that same time had to replace bumpers 3 times (twice my fault, once my wife's) because the Sharan so damn wide you're scraping something before you know it. In that sense, good riddance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're on good terms with our local Volkswagen dealer, and we decided to downsize to the newest member of the VW line, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2015-volkswagen-sportwagen-golf-variant-first-drive-review&quot;&gt;Golf Variant&lt;/a&gt;, a station wagon. It was released in September, we ordered right away, and took delivery at the end of January (that is, today). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my wife gets a lot more excited about cars than I. She'll study the web sites and the specs to find exactly what she wants. For me, a car is simply a vehicle to take me from A to B. She's excited about the new car and what it can do. I'm just happy that it's smaller and we're less likely to tear off a bumper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I hope that choice is right because the lease is for another three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a week's worth of documents, weighing in at 2.4 kg, for our accountant, in case you've wondered if we've done any work over the holidays. It's a bit more than usual since it's end-of-month, we normally have 1.0 to 1.5 kg per week. (Yes, it's all scanned as well, but we don't have a digital workflow with the accountant yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

In case it wasn't clear from the original post, my main objection to the first trip was that it was on a Saturday when the roads and the store would be completely full. My wife is redesigning our bathroom, and it was important to her that she show me the items in person at the store so I would feel involved in the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our purchasing using the self-service registers was an utter failure. Of our 14 items, we managed to leave 2 items unscanned at the table. I swear I spent and hour looking for our new blinds until I realized that they weren't on our receipt and they never made it out of the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to return from our weekend and to escape without any long-term repercussions, so I'm sure it's safe to reveal where our destination. For the occasion of our 30th wedding anniversary, we took the ferry from Kiel and spent the weekend in Oslo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you will now ask us, &quot;Hold on, isn't that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/09/08/oslo-cruise/&quot;&gt;exact same destination&lt;/a&gt; you had for your 25th wedding anniversary?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes, 5 years ago we also took the ferry to Oslo. But it wasn't exactly the same the last time. For one, this time we stayed overnight, at the lovely Radisson Blu Plaza, a hotel that is, well, tall, with a lovely view of the Oslo skyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another, we took a bicycle tour though the city with &lt;a href=&quot;http://vikingbikingoslo.com/&quot; title=&quot;Viking Biking&quot;&gt;Viking Biking&lt;/a&gt;, which was the perfect way to spend the afternoon, especially as the weather was nearly perfect (5 years ago it was cool and cloudy). It was very pleasant, low-key (central Oslo is relatively flat) and entertaining, and the tour highly deserves its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g190479-d2697659-Reviews-Viking_Biking-Oslo_Eastern_Norway.html#REVIEWS&quot;&gt;high rating on Trip Advisor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, we treated ourselves to a 5-star cabin, and booked a separate cabin for our son. He could be Mr. Independent on the ship, while we had some time for ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to make us feel old, there was a concert by Soundgarden next door to our hotel. We were born 10 years too early to appreciate them, and our hotel was full of nostalgic 40-something fans all younger than us. Happy Anniversary!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>German Surveillance</title>

&lt;p&gt;All the talk of the &quot;NSA Affair&quot; in Germany reminds of a time when we were definitely spied upon by the German government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early '90s we were visiting a relative in Bonn, which was still the German capital. We were exploring the government district and were admiring the &lt;em&gt;Bundeskanzleramt&lt;/em&gt;, the Chancellor's office, occupied at the time by Helmut Kohl. We were outside the entrance gate, and behind the &lt;em&gt;Bundeskanzleramt&lt;/em&gt; was an office building with the distinctive 3-pointed Mercedes star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of us mentioned how utterly appropriate it was that a symbol of German industry was looking down upon the Chancellor's office when suddenly the loudspeaker on the gate crackled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Star of Bethlehem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the absolute highlight of our trip to Bonn.&lt;/p&gt;

Juni 1953&quot;&gt;commemorated&lt;/a&gt; the 60th anniversary of the June 17th workers' uprising in East Germany in 1953. President Gauck spoke, linking the uprising then with the struggles for freedom throughout the world today, but the ceremony has merited only a brief mention in the German media. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/18/heros-without-glory/&quot; title=&quot;Heros without Glory&quot;&gt;Ten years ago&lt;/a&gt; I blogged about a documentary on the uprising which impresses me even today, particularly this photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://heldenohneruhm.de/&quot;&gt;Helden ohne Ruhm&lt;/a&gt; is a fascinating documentary of the 1953 uprising shown in ARD last night.

The photo is from newly discovered footage from Leipzig. The girl holding the sign was imprisoned until 1962.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Grinding it out</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2013/05/20/grinding-it-out/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-20T09:27:33+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2013/05/20/grinding-it-out</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2013/04/02/back-to-the-grind/&quot;&gt;last fitness post&lt;/a&gt; I've been progressing at making progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a 5K run at the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buchholzerstadtlauf.de/&quot;&gt;Stadtlauf&lt;/a&gt; in June as a goal, I started running every other day following the run/walk program in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B006OH9ENM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1638&amp;amp;creative=19454&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B006OH9ENM&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=papascott-21&quot;&gt;The Beginning Runner's Handbook&lt;/a&gt;. That program is actually for a 10K, so the 5K at the Stadtlauf should be a piece of cake (although it's on asphalt and might be hot), right? The program calls for 3 runs a week, however I'm cheating a bit by sticking to every other day. As a result I'm already on Week 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually did the 5K at the Stadtlauf in 2010, but I didn't train sufficiently or correctly and &lt;s&gt;nearly died&lt;/s&gt; was very sore the following week. My run yesterday was 55 minutes (with 3 1-minute walking breaks) and nearly 7K and I felt fine (slow pace with pulse in the 130s the entire time). The Stadtlauf should go just fine. And the 10K training won't go to waste, I'm intending to keep it up for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://volkslauf.vfl-jesteburg.de/&quot;&gt;Volkslauf in Jesteburg&lt;/a&gt; in September (through woods in fall weather).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the days I don't run I've been working out at the fitness center, so except for one day last week when I hurt my foot I've been doing fitness everyday for 8 weeks, since the week before Easter. And I have the results to show for it. I've lost a further 3 kg in the meantime, my weight is at 90.x (sounds like a radio station frequency), and my body fat is down too. My goals are 89.x by the end of June and 84.x by the end of September.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also a test of &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;fargo.io&lt;/a&gt; for posting to WordPress. (Note: to separate paragraphs you seem to need blank line directly after each one.)  I promise my next post will be about something more interesting than my improving fitness. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Salt of the Earth</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2013/04/04/salt-of-the-earth/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-04T18:07:38+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2013/04/04/salt-of-the-earth</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the cool things about 30 years of marriage (yes, it's going to be THIRTY YEARS this September) is that it's still possible after all that time to discover minuscule areas where you have irreconcilable differences. Or maybe &quot;re-discover&quot; is the better word, since for all we know we already knew all the things that annoy us about our partner but had conveniently forgotten them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, salt. My mother is a health-conscious nurse, so even in the '70s when I was growing up we didn't eat a lot of salt. She always cooked with a herbal mixture to replace salt. I never got in the habit of adding salt at the table, and don't think of a salt shaker as an essential piece of cutlery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife, on the other hand, will salt everything, often without tasting it first (especially if I have cooked it). She gets nervous if she sits at the table and there is not a salt shaker within reach. We sometimes have 3 or 4 salt shakers on the table at one time, since she often brings one to the table herself to make sure there's one there. And by my observation, her use of salt is moderate compared to some in her family and in Germany in general. I sometimes think that the heavy use of salt can so deaden the taste buds that one forgets food can have taste other than salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when my nutrition class mentioned that cutting down on salt was not only healthy, but good for weight loss, I had no problems putting that into effect for myself. It however opened up a new source of conflict. I would cook a healthy dish without salt, my wife would grimace and reach for the salt shaker, I would roll my eyes, and our entertainment was guaranteed for the rest of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/gefro-040413.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gefro Di√§twurze&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;Some peace has been restored to our household through the use of a salt substitute (which, strangely enough, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myline24.de/shop/essen-trinken/gefro-produktwelt/gefro-di%C3%A4tw%C3%BCrze-und-di%C3%A4tsuppe&quot;&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; by the publisher of the nutrition class). It's based on potassium chloride, and tastes something like chicken soup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't work that well at the table, though. The last time my wife asked me to pass the salt (which I had conveniently placed at the opposite end of the table from her), I instead handed her a newspaper article with the headline &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/ratgeber/wissen/article114765123/Millionen-Tote-durch-zu-hohen-Salzkonsum.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Millions of deaths from excessive salt consumption&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Just my way of saying I love you, honey! (And after she threw the newspaper in my face, I handed her the salt.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Back to the Grind</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2013/04/02/back-to-the-grind/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-02T20:36:58+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2013/04/02/back-to-the-grind</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Forgive me, internet, for I have sinned. It has been over 3 months since my last blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And about the time of that last blog post I noticed that my weight and fitness were both leaving much to be desired. (I'm sure my wife noticed long before I did, and I'm sure she tried to let me know about it, and I'm even more sure I did my best to ignore her.) My weight was brushing up to triple-figures in kilograms (that's 220 pounds in dog years), and that was my wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of months I've been trying to put myself first as far as diet and exercise go. Instead of just thinking about going to the gym, I actually went to the gym three times a week. As motivation I bought a Spotify subscription for my cell phone and a set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/backbeat-go&quot;&gt;Plantronics BackBeat Go&lt;/a&gt; wireless sport headphones (as &lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/013489.html&quot;&gt;recommended by vowe&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶ with gadgets you can do much worse than to buy &lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/013739.html&quot;&gt;what vowe keeps&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also retook the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myline24.de/&quot;&gt;MyLine&lt;/a&gt; nutrition course at our gym. Having taken it once before, it all sounded familiar and I was able to take more of it to heart than the first time. The first change they recommend is to eat 5 times a day. That's not as easy as it sounds. Avoiding alcohol is also a challenge. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But between the workouts and the nutrition and the positive motivation I was able to see results after two months. 6 kilos lost. Body fat reduced by nearly 3 percentage points. Waist and hips 3 cm smaller. Not bad for a guy who just turned 51.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're doing the math, you'll know my weight is not yet ideal. (To help you calculate BMI, my height is 174 cm. As my trainer said, if I were 15 cm taller my weight would be ideal.) So'll I'll be sticking with the program for another 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, my next goal has been handed to me on a silver platter. Our business co-sponsors the local &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buchholzerstadtlauf.de/&quot;&gt;Stadtlauf&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (city run) in June, and the organizer told (not asked) my wife, &quot;and your husband will run 5K this time&quot;. I'll take that as a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>More Blessed to Give</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/12/29/more-blessed-to-give/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-29T07:38:37+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/12/29/more-blessed-to-give</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm not a particularly materialistic person. It's said that it is more blessed to give than to receive. If that's the case, then I had a particularly blessed Christmas. I've been blessed by a ratio of approximately 10 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of this is due to the arrangement that my in-laws have with one another, to not arrange gifts among the adults, but only for the nieces and nephews and then with a strict price limit. In this arrangement everything is systematic and pre-arranged without any risk of surprise or forethought. The suggested gifts are specified to the last detail, usually accompanied by a ISBN number or an Amazon link. Those who have no specific wishes simply wish for iTunes gift cards. Larger suggestions can be combined among families or with Oma, with a complicated accounting of how the costs are shared and who pays whom for what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, our gift for Christopher this was a somewhat expensive musical instrument, a set of small pipes imported from Canada. My idea was that the in-laws could give a share of the instrument as their gift to Christopher: the set budget for Christmas and birthday would cover one-twelfth of the cost. I assumed this would be entered into the post-Christmas cost-of-gift accounting. But for some reason, perhaps because the small pipes did not have an item number at Amazon, the in-laws had all instead prepared envelopes with cash for Christopher. That was somewhat awkward as he already had gotten the pipes on Christmas Eve, so I had to snatch the cash from the cards. One of them had even pasted the bills with double-sides sticky pads to the card, which could only be removed with 10 minutes elbow grease and nail polish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my gifts within the family I did my best to break the rules about avoiding surprise and forethought. For Christopher I found a couple of his favorite US groceries (Honey-Nut Cheerios!), for my wife some Brazilian jewelry and her specific wish for a bag for eyeglasses on her running belt (she lost a pair in the woods a couple of months ago; if you see a wild boar wearing bifocals you know who they belong to). For both I found a print of a hand-drawn map of London to remember our recent trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit I'm being selective about counting gifts received. I'm not counting cash from the US (saves on shipping and I can pick out what I want), and I'm also not counting the colored sugar-and-spice calendar given to both my wife and me. I will also admit that the 50-year-old male is not the easiest to pick out presents for. I probably wouldn't know what to get myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end my best and only present is a blue terry-cloth bathrobe. I already had a blue terry-cloth bathrobe, but it was 10 years old and my wife decided it was too ragged to look at anymore. The new robe is longer but not as warm. It will also be a constant reminder of how blessed I was this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Good People and The Criminals</title>

   <updated>2012-12-18T20:52:29+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/12/18/the-good-people-and-the-criminals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the awful shooting in Newtown, Connecticut last week I've been searching for the perfect words to say. I still haven't found them, and I may never will, but my high school friend Beth posted her thoughts on Facebook. They are pretty much the most reasonable words I've read so far, and with her permission I repeat them here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something missing from the discussion about guns and violence and mass shootings going on this past week. The underlying assumptions about people. The &quot;guns don't kill people, people do&quot; folks assume there are two clear distinct groups of people: criminals and good people. If good people are armed, they can thwart the criminals. We can't &quot;punish&quot; the good people in our attempts to control criminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reject that view of the world. We are all just people. We are all capable of being loving and caring. We are all capable of being selfish and fearful. We can all be overwhelmed by grief, terror and yes, even rage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I readily confess to my darkness. I get pissed off while driving. I become too protective of the ones I love. I rage against the machine. I reach the end of my rope and become irrational. And when I do, the world is a safer place because I don't have a gun on my person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoy shooting. I really really do. And I have pretty decent aim. But I think we are all safer for me not having a gun on my person at all times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When does a &quot;good person&quot; who deserves to have a gun become a &quot;criminal&quot; who we need guns to stop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I maintain we are all a bit of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It's an battery-powered alarm clock with siren and flashing police light. Can anyone guess why we might want this? Hint: we're not waking up any sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/11/30/london-for-absolute-beginners</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some random points from our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/10/08/antalya-and-london/&quot;&gt;visit to London&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/8231128036&quot; title=&quot;View 'IMG_1186' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_1186&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/8231128036_de59d8944c_m.jpg&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking the cheap train from Gatwick to London makes a whole lot a stops and is probably not worth the trouble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are at all claustrophobic and get cold shivers from the elevator scenes in Speed, you certainly want to avoid the Covent Garden tube station at all costs. Only way out are crowded elevators or 193 steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're German by nature and get to Buckingham Palace 90 minutes before the Changing of the Guard, the friendly bobbies will make sure no late-coming tourists will cut in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employment profile of the hospitality industry in London is dominated by Eastern Europeans. Pub food is, however, tastier and less expensive than we had been led to believe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/8229914155&quot; title=&quot;View 'IMG_1131' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_1131&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8057/8229914155_9158542d90_m.jpg&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robroypub.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Rob Roy&lt;/a&gt; is a Scottish pub near Paddington where you can be served haggis, if your pipe-learning son is so inclined and you can wait for the cook to come in for the evening shift. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People in London are colorful in every sense of the word. Quite refreshing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/8232462575&quot; title=&quot;View 'IMG_0441' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0441&quot; width=&quot;179&quot; src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8232462575_15f2d544d0_m.jpg&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The streets and train stations are impeccably clean, even by German standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tube stations seem to have been planned to ensure the longest possible walk when changing lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greenwich is a bit out of the way but a nice quiet base to stay. The DLR gets you to central London in 20 minutes, and Sainsbury's Local will meet all your basic food and drink needs. Plus you can head to the Royal Observatory and stand on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Meridian_(Greenwich)&quot;&gt;Prime Meridian&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/&quot;&gt;Tower of London&lt;/a&gt; lives up to the hype. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Making of Harry Potter studio tour&lt;/a&gt; is expensive, but worth it if you're into Harry Potter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EasyJet is a cheap airline in every sense of the word. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll be back.&lt;/li&gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

   <title>Touch 'Em All</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/10/25/touch-em-all/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-25T21:53:42+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/10/25/touch-em-all</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was somewhat stunned to read that today is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://aarongleeman.com/2012/10/25/twins-notes-40-man-cuts-declining-capps-baker-talks-and-25-years-ago/&quot;&gt;25th anniversary of the Minnesota Twins winning the 1987 World Series&lt;/a&gt;. Given that I am now 50, that is half my life ago. And while a sports event certainly didn't play a direct role in our lives, it marked a milestone. 1987 was an important year for us that eventually brought us to Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, we actually saw a lot a Twins games that year. We lived in south Minneapolis, we could easily bike to the Metrodome, and the bleacher seats in center field cost just $3. And they were the best seats in the house, since we were right behind the center fielder Kirby Puckett, and could see him make his spectacular catches. We watched at least a dozen games live, maybe even 20, but did not attend any playoff or World Series games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, that fall of 1987 was the beginning of my PhD program at the University of Minnesota. But I was beginning to have my doubts as to whether I was cut out for an academic career, and the choices involved to get academic funding. As an Agricultural Economist, let's just say the locations for research are not among the metropolises of the world (Davis, Iowa City, Norman, College Station, etc.). So it was really the beginning of the end, and 6 months later I dropped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my wife, in the fall of 1987 her first boss was in the process of selling his McDonald's franchise in Minneapolis to move to Arizona. Her superior and many of her colleagues would move to Arizona too, and after a year of sticking it out with the new franchisee, we ended up moving to Arizona as well. We weren't able to find a place with her old boss in Arizona, but made the connections that brought us to Germany in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So October 1987 was a turning point in our lives, and it just happened that the Twins won the World Series that month. Was it really 25 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Antalya and London</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/10/08/antalya-and-london/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-08T05:56:01+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/10/08/antalya-and-london</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Despite my attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/08/16/travel-blog/&quot;&gt;start a travel blog&lt;/a&gt; a couple of months ago, we don't actually get out and about that much. Owning a business and having a school-aged child just cramps our style somehow. So it's somewhat unusual that this month, we have not just one, but two (count 'em. two!) foreign trips planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hotel_100.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hotel 100&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; style=&quot;float:right;&quot; /&gt;The first is this week and actually a business trip. We all (we're taking number one son out of school for 3 days) fly to Antalya, Turkey, for the annual fall franchisee meeting at some luxury hotel built for Russian oligarchs. It will be warmer than home, though, and we are extending our stay by a night so we have all day Saturday to ourselves before flying back just in time for school and work on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AlMdzRpCEAA3-f5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AlMdzRpCEAA3-f5-300x224.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;AlMdzRpCEAA3-f5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-4844&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The second half of October our son as fall break from school, and I'll be cashing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/papascott/statuses/167510377884684288&quot;&gt;my birthday present&lt;/a&gt; from my family, a 5 night trip to London. Of course, &quot;birthday present&quot; means 1) the entire family comes along, and 2) they only come up with the idea and I get to do all the planning myself. Despite having lived in Europe for over 20 years, we've never been to London so it will be all new to us. All I know about London is that it's wonderful and expensive, so we'll be staying in Greenwich and be taking the train a lot to see the sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that we'll be all travelled out for while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine years ago today was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/09/06/&quot;&gt;Tuesday after Labor Day&lt;/a&gt; when, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://brucespringsteen.net/songs/the-river&quot;&gt;Bruce Springsteen put it&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;the judge put it all to rest&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days we can only joke about how long it has been. We can still quote the &lt;s&gt;English&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;German&lt;/s&gt; (whatever) TV classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner_for_One&quot;&gt;&quot;Dinner for One&quot;&lt;/a&gt; to one another: &quot;You look younger than ever, love! Younger than ever!&quot; Of course, the line may wear out someday. If someday this blog ceases to be updated and you hear about a particularly gory family drama* from northern Germany, you'll know I tried the line once too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Family drama (&lt;em&gt;Familiendrama&lt;/em&gt;) is one of those phrases that in German means something completely different than in English. For us it might mean a TV show suitable to watch with your kids, or perhaps the &quot;discussion&quot; that ensues when a teenaged daughter tells her parents that she is pregnant. In German it refers to a murder (often a murder/suicide) within a family.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Travel Blog</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/08/16/travel-blog/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-16T17:05:05+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/08/16/travel-blog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've just returned from 2 weeks' vacation. I've heard that one can earn fame, fortune and lots of SEO love by writing travel blog posts, so I'll try my hand at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited my parents' lake cabin in Minnesota. They bought the cabin when I was a kid, and my wife and I have been going there for 30 years, so we didn't really see anything new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insider tip for air travel: if you a German traveling to the US, make sure your &lt;a href=&quot;https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/&quot;&gt;ESTA&lt;/a&gt; is up to date. Otherwise you might have the joy of flying standby without your family the next day! Trust us, we know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we stayed with my parents, we got a really good deal on lodging. You have to really be an insider to get that rate, though. No way to get it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saved money by not renting a car, but having my parents take us from and to the airport. I doubt that they would do that for anybody else. We did spring for some gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the local cuisine, you have to catch it yourself from the lake. Or buy it yourself from the meat market. Either way, no one cooks it for you. That's what the gas grill is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for local people and customs, we did have a mini family reunion the first Sunday we were they. Since I've known my relatives all my life, I didn't really get any new insights on local life (although a couple of them did rag on me for not blogging often enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear that including a picture can increase the influence of travel blog posts. Here it is. My wife has several dozen more just like it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I am not an Expat Blogger 7: Food</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Note: the name of the series has been updated to more accurately reflect the spirit in which it's intended.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don't miss American food.&lt;/strong&gt; It seems every expat blogger goes through a phase where they're missing some type of food from home, usually something heavily processed and extremely unhealthy. Comfort food. Some expats never snap out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's because our business is food (my wife says to add that you're all welcome to buy all the comfort food you want from us!), or because I learned economics and understand supply and demand, but I was never all that emotionally attached to food from home. If there's something you miss, learn to make it (or a close approximation) yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can find peanut butter and Oreos at pretty much any German supermarket these days.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don't use public transportation.&lt;/strong&gt; Most novice expats will gush about how in Germany they don't need a car at all, and with bike, bus, tram, subway, commuter train, or whatever, they can get everywhere they need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have a public bus that stops in our village. During rush hour it stops every hour, during the day every two hours. That might be OK for commuting to school or work (the times are coordinated with trains to Hamburg), but it's not particularly convenient for daily life. And since there are no shops in our village at all, not even a bakery, we'd be stuck without two cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we do try to use public transportation to get to Hamburg when we can. But we drive a car to the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This also reminds me of my favorite German joke: &lt;em&gt;Alle reden vom √∂ffentlichen Verkehr, aber keiner traut sich!&lt;/em&gt; It can't really be translated, but &lt;em&gt;Verkehr&lt;/em&gt; can mean either transportation or intercourse, so think of public &lt;em&gt;Verkehr&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don't get 5 weeks vacation.&lt;/strong&gt; Or 6. Or 4. In Germany there's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesurlaubsgesetz&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bundesurlaubsgesetz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that regulates vacation time for employees. The legal minimum is 4 weeks per year, although most industries have contracts that call for more. Our employees get 5 to 6 weeks vacation, depending on longevity, as set in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bundesverband-systemgastronomie.de/ueber-den-bds/tarifabschluss.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manteltarifvertrag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as a business owner you're on your own. And our business tends to be busiest when other people are enjoying themselves (weekends, school vacations and holidays). We tend to take a couple days off time and again rather than a bunch of days in one piece. The work is always waiting for us when we get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, though, we are heading to Minnesota for a couple of weeks. The cell phones are staying home.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fire Camp</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We interrupt the &quot;I'm not an expat&quot; series (AKA &quot;expats don't understand me and noone else does either&quot;) for an important dispatch from the home front. Our village of L√ºllau (population 500) is usually pretty quiet, but today the population expanded 4 times and the noise level as well. Our local volunteer fire department is playing host to the &lt;em&gt;Kreisjugendfeuerwehrzeltlager&lt;/em&gt; (literally &quot;county youth fire dept tent camp&quot;) with 1500 participants on a field just outside our quiet village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This empty field (where we celebrate the village Easter fire every year) is now covered with tents, a field kitchen, toilets and showers and everything to keep 1500 youth and adult volunteer fire fighters happy for eight days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the camp might be a little loud, but our village of L√ºllau will have the best fire protection in the whole county for the next week!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had done this before.&lt;/strong&gt; You know the feeling of being alone in a strange culture, not knowing the language, coming to grips with customs you don't understand, and in the end coming to grips with everything and realizing that, yes, not only can you survive in a such an environment, you can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been there, done that, and long before I came to Germany. At age 17 I was an exchange student in Fortaleza, in northeastern Brazil. While Germany can be strange and wonderful at times, it is nowhere as strange and wonderful as Brazil. For a boy from the American Midwest, I was most impressed the huge difference between rich and poor (not to mention the beaches, the caipirinhas, and the music).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the main thing I picked up was self-confidence. I knew if I could make it there, I could make it anywhere. So moving to Germany was, emotionally speaking, a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've always thought of myself as an &quot;expat blogger in Germany&quot;, but lately I'm not so sure. Reading blog posts from my fellow expats usually results in shrugs or a WTF. Maybe I'm becoming out of touch, or I'm not a very typical expat‚Ä¶ (the first of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/category/not-an-expat/&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don't speak English.&lt;/strong&gt; In real life, outside the internet, I speak almost no English at all. We speak German at home (my wife and I made a deal to always speak the language of the country we're in to one another‚Ä¶ we'd be in big trouble if we ever moved to France!). My job (business) is all German. Other than the proprietor of our local Baja California restaurant, I know no native English speakers (and she's actually a US-born German).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the '90s I worked for an English-language publisher, where we had a mostly-English-speaking office (Brits slightly outnumbering Americans). These days, though, about the only English I speak is when I phone home to my family, or I'm helping my son with his English homework from school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived to find a &lt;em&gt;ma√Ætre d'&lt;/em&gt; at the door, a table set in a quiet corner with candles, flowers and tablecloth, a printed menu, and a hostess ready to take our order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose to split the special of the day, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/produktfinder.html#/steakhouse_classic&quot;&gt;Steakhouse Classic&lt;/a&gt; in the current promotion as a McMenu with 2 side salads, a side order of Chicken Sticks, and a vintage 2012 Cola Light (Cola Zero for me) to drink. We passed on desert, deciding instead on an Espresso Macchiato to round off the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a very nice gesture and great fun, and many thanks to our crew for the idea and the invitation. However, it got us thinking: maybe other guests would enjoy an exclusive, fun and special candlelight dinner at our McDonald's? Maybe it's something we could offer‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Brawl on the Highway</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We always thought life in our sleepy little village was pretty quiet, but think again! Freely translated from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kreiszeitung-wochenblatt.de/&quot;&gt;Nordheide Wochenblatt&lt;/a&gt; (30 June 2012):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brawl on the Highway: a driver goes bezerk over failure to yield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When reason fails, some people rather trust their fists. That was the case last Thursday afternoon. The result: an injury and a whole list of charges. A driver from Buchholz (51) nearly cut off another driver (59) while pulling out of a driveway in Jesteburg. Both cars continued towards L√ºllau when the older driver motioned for the first driver to stop. Both drivers get out of their cars, and the 59-yr-old driver swung a punch at the 51-yr-old. He was able to block the punch and threw one of his own, losing his cell phone in the process. The female companion of the 59-yr-old then picked up the cell phone and threw it onto a nearby field. Despite an intensive search, the cell phone was not found. A judge is scheduled to tell the two drivers what he thinks of their antics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Our son's reaction: Which highway was that? I want to find that phone!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Follow Me to Bubble Tea</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/05/26/follow-me-to-bubble-tea/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-26T09:30:55+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/05/26/follow-me-to-bubble-tea</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time for a business post! A couple days ago I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/papascott/status/204798796243283969&quot; title=&quot;4 big changes coming to German McDonald's in the next 3 weeks! Never a dull day for us!&quot;&gt;teased on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that big changes were coming to German McDonald's in the next couple of weeks. I was going to wait until the marketing started before going into detail, but now that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-dienstleister/neuheiten-bei-der-fastfood-kette-bei-mcdonalds-perlt-es-bald-seite-all/6674690-all.html&quot; title=&quot;Handelsblatt: Bei McDonald‚Äôs perlt es bald&quot;&gt;Handelsblatt newspaper has spilled the beans&lt;/a&gt;, it's OK to come out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big one comes on June 11, when McDonald's starts selling bubble tea in McCaf√©. Bubble tea is a trend drink that originated in Taiwan and is fairly new in Europe. It's basically sweet tea with fruit syrup and tapioca &quot;boba&quot; pearls or flavored jellies. The bobas or jellies sink to the bottom of the cup and can be sucked up through the straw. With 2 sizes, 3 types of tea, 7 flavors, and 6 flavors of bobas and jellies, there are over 250 combinations possible. Bubble tea is sweet and certainly not low-calorie, but generally contains less sugar than soft drinks. There will be a coupon in the the June coupon booklet if you want to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bubble-Tea-50.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bubble Tea&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;266&quot; height=&quot;354&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;Bubble tea is the fastest growing segment of the fast food industry and is very popular for 13 to 20 year olds. Bubble tea shops generally import their ingredients. The jellies and bobas for McCaf√© Bubble Tea are produced in Germany especially for McDonald's and contain no additives. Bubble tea is a first for McDonald's in Europe (maybe worldwide?), and if it is successful here we're sure other countries will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second change is not so spectacular. Starting June 4 McDonald's will sell Br√∂tchen for breakfast, three types of normal German Br√∂tchen: Kaiser-, Korn and LaugenbroÃàtchen, either with traditional condiments (butter, jam, honey, Nutella) or as a sandwich. Br√∂tchen have been very successful for McDonald's Austria and we think they will be here, too. The marketing people call it &quot;local relevance&quot;. We just think that if you want to sell breakfast in Germany, you have to sell what Germans eat for breakfast, so it's a change we welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other changes are already out: a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/mcdonalds-deutschland/id524943492&quot;&gt;McDonald's Deutschland iPhone app&lt;/a&gt; with in-app couponing (starting with the June booklet, not exactly cutting edge anymore but it's a start) and new lower price-point &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/mcdeal.html&quot;&gt;&quot;McDeal&quot; menus&lt;/a&gt; that cost 3-something instead of 5- or 6-something like the &quot;McMen√ºs&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a whole lot to learn and train the next three weeks, but hey, if we wanted jobs where each day is just like the day before, we'd be in a different business. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Tale of Two Glasses</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/05/16/a-tale-of-two-glasses/"/>
   <updated>2012-05-16T08:16:29+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/05/16/a-tale-of-two-glasses</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/twoglasses.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two Glasses&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;145&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the joys of getting older is deteriorating eyesight. Having been near-sighted all my life, my near vision is now getting worse so that I'm now in effect no-sighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have experienced the joy of bifocals for the past couple of years, and have learned to unconsciously tilt my head to the appropriate angle for looking things near and far. Things in the middle (i.e. somewhat beyond arm's length) are problematic, since they are in the transition zone of the lens and one can only focus on a thin horizontal stripe at one time. That makes it difficult to look at a larger surface, like, say, a computer screen, without constantly bobbing one's head to continually adjust the angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But modern optometry has the solution: a separate set of computer glasses focused at the distance between your eyes and the monitor. Voil√†! I could see the entire screen at once for the first time in ages! However, every medical wonder has a dark side. Or multiple dark sides. The first is having to keep track of two pairs of glasses. Given that one can only wear one pair at a time on one's face, the other pair is always someplace else, and that someplace else is never the same place where one needs them. (I have an app to ping my iPhone when I've misplaced it. There is no such app to ping my glasses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another new problem is that no matter which pair of glasses I have on, they always feel like the wrong pair. Even when they are the right pair. I was at least smart enough not to order identical frames for both glasses. The computer glasses have a ridge on the temples, so I can always feel with my fingers which pair I have on, because I can't tell just with my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third problem is that one has to remember to switch glasses when leaving the computer. (Switching glasses when coming to the computer is easy to remember, since the first thing one notices is &quot;Oh, I cannot see the screen!&quot;) One cannot competently perform normal tasks when one can only see items exactly 20 inches from one's face. More than once I've caught myself driving away from the house and realizing only then that I have the wrong glasses and cannot see past the windshield. Not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So computer glasses are both a blessing and a curse, and have made my life infinitely more complicated than before.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MacMini Media Center</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/03/18/macmini-media-center/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-18T09:17:29+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/03/18/macmini-media-center</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my 50th birthday, I decided to splurge a bit on my present. After all, you only turn 50 once (although admittedly one could say the same for 49 or 51). I decided to get myself a fancy DVD player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/macmini2011silver.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Macmini2011silver&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you notice, it's not really a DVD player. For one thing, there's no place to insert a DVD. For another, it's actually a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macmini/&quot;&gt;MacMini&lt;/a&gt; computer with full HDMI output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had made a couple of attempts before to attach a media player to our TV. The latest attempt was a WD TV Live, to which you attach an external hard disk or connect to network shares. The user interface leaves much to be desired, and networking for us (over a powerline interface) worked hit or miss at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monkey wrench in the works is that we still have an analog TV, a 10-year-old 32&quot; Samsung I can barely lift. We're going to renovate our living room Real Soon Now‚Ñ¢ (first intended for 2010, now possibly in 2014), and we'll get a new TV when we have that done. The Samsung has only 2 SCART inputs, which makes attaching multiple devices rather difficult. Given the analog TV, the HDMI output goes to waste (for now). All our video is standard definition, anyway, so attaching a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B002CBN81S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=papascott-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1638&amp;amp;creative=19454&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002CBN81S&quot;&gt;HDMI-to-analog converter&lt;/a&gt; doesn't degrade anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pleasant surprise with the Mac Mini is that networking over powerline works just fine. I can control it from my MacBookPro with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/&quot;&gt;Remote Desktop&lt;/a&gt;, it can stream files from elsewhere on our home network just fine, I can rip DVDs to it from other computers or start &lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.fr/&quot;&gt;Handbrake&lt;/a&gt; on it to convert ripped DVDs to more useful formats. To start movies in the living room we've got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.logitech.com/en-roeu/remotes/universal-remotes/devices/8717&quot;&gt;Harmony One&lt;/a&gt; remote that can be paired with the Mac Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the software, I knew in advance I'd be wanting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plexapp.com/&quot;&gt;Plex&lt;/a&gt;, which is so cool I'll be writing a whole separate post about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a number of good tutorials on setting up a Mac Mini Meia Center. For me a good starting point was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yousephtanha.com/blog/2011/02/09/mac-mini-media-center-project-part-1/&quot;&gt;Mac Mini Media Center Project&lt;/a&gt; series by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yousephtanha.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Youseph Tanha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Our Adventure with the Bagpipe</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/03/16/our-adventure-with-the-bagpipe/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-16T22:38:08+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/03/16/our-adventure-with-the-bagpipe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few months ago our son announced he wanted to learn the bagpipe. The Scottish bagpipe. And wear a kilt. At first we thought it was just a phase, and we laughed it off. And ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our son kept insisting. And looking up bagpipes on the internet. And kilts. So my wife and I decided to swallow our prejudices about bagpipes, and got him a &quot;starter kit&quot; for his birthday in December. It turns out to learn bagpipe you don't actually play a bagpipe for the first year or so, since it's rather complicated to keep the bag full of air and play music at the same time. You start out by learning the notes with a &quot;practice chanter&quot;, which resembles the fingering part of the bagpipe and has a similar reed. It looks like a recorder, but takes a whole lot more air to play, and at first it sounds like a duck call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a few days with the chanter, the book, and the CD he started playing actual notes. And he kept at it. So we started to look around for someone to teach lessons. That's not quite as easy as with more common instruments, where you can sign up at the local music store. You have to do some looking around. At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dudelsackkurse.de/&quot;&gt;http://www.dudelsackkurse.de/&lt;/a&gt; we found Herbert Bartmann in Oldenburg who offers a day-long beginners course on weekends, and read that 12 is the perfect age to start learning. Oldenburg is an hour drive each way, somewhat impractical for weekly lessons, but I brought him in for the day course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that we were on the right track for getting started. Our son could play the scale and read notes by now, and after 8 hours with Mr. Bartmann was even more excited to learn more. He helped us make contact with a teacher in Hamburg, and we've had two lessons with him so far. It looks like our adventure will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a lay person listening in on the lessons, I've found the bagpipe to be more interesting than I imagined, particularly how one works within the limitations of the instrument. Its range is limited (9 notes, a little more than an octave), has a constant volume (no way to play quietly), and has a constant, uninterrupted tone. All the music is in the fingering, with grace notes and doublings surrounding the individual notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our son's goal is to play a bagpipe solo at his school's Christmas concert‚Ä¶ this year would be a little soon, but 2013 is certainly an attainable goal. We'll see then if he's still serious about the kilt.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It's Still Raining</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/01/13/its-still-raining/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-13T07:19:49+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/01/13/its-still-raining</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An inside joke in our house is that if I answer the phone and right after the &quot;Hello&quot; start discussing the weather, my wife knows my parents in Minnesota have called. Never mind the Caller ID and the fact I'm speaking English are also dead giveaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course in Minnesota the weather is a valid topic for conversation. It's extreme! They've got bitter cold, sweltering heat, massive thunderstorms, killer blizzards, and (insert your own adjective here) tornados! If you're not careful the weather can kill you! Drivers are advised to keep blankets and chocolate in their cars, since if they get stuck in the snow on a country road it could take a day or two or three before they can get out. My father was a highway engineer, responsible for keeping roads clear. He spent half his career watching the weather and planning accordingly. And in retirement, he hasn't quite gotten out of the habit. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Minnesota weather is worth a conversation, Hamburg weather is worth at best a grunt. Maritime climate. 130 days of rain per year. Moderate temperatures. Regular seasons. Sometimes wind. Hmmph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There are sometimes exceptions, of course, like in 2010 when we had snow and ice on the ground for 3 months: January, February and December. Those months stick out like sore thumbs on our business statements. It's not that it was so cold, but that the highway departments ran out of salt and couldn't clear the roads. They should have called my father for advice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the past 3 weeks we've had rain and 4¬∞C/40¬∞F, broken up only by days with wind and rain. The damp cold seeps through your clothing and sticks to your skin. If you're prone to depression due to seasonal affective disorder, this is not the place to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when my parents call and tell me about the latest extreme phenomenon they are experiencing, they always ask politely how the weather is here. My answer is pretty much always the same. It's still raining.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Alarm Clocks</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/01/11/alarm-clocks/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-11T06:35:56+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2012/01/11/alarm-clocks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've gotten out of the habit of using alarm clocks. As a result, when I wake up I usually have no idea what the time is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(No, this is not about how alarm clocks are obsolete in the 21st century and we use iPhones instead. iPhones as well as landline phones are banned from our bedroom. If you want to reach us in the middle of the night, you better bring the patience for us to hear the ringing from downstairs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that we don't have an alarm clock in our bedroom. At last count we have four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two matching digital alarms from that German coffee and gadget (and sports clothing and kitchen utensils and and and) shop &lt;a href=&quot;http://tchibo.de/&quot;&gt;Tchibo&lt;/a&gt;. On mine the buttons are very difficult so it goes unused. My wife's is face down on the headboard. The clock is so bright that even at the lowest setting it casts the entire room in an eerie yellow glow. It's like one of those pods from Matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 3 is an iPod/iPhone speaker clock my wife gave me a couple of years ago. It somehow ended up on her side of the bed. It has way too many buttons and goes unused. Also, see above about iPhones being banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 4 is an analog radio-controlled clock from precision clock-maker &lt;a href=&quot;http://tchibo.de/&quot;&gt;Tchibo&lt;/a&gt;. It glows in the dark and shows the precise time. However, being analog, the alarm is not at all precise and can be set only at circa 10 minute intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, none of our collection of alarm clocks is particularly useful because from our bed we cannot see them. For one thing, our current bedroom furniture collection has no side tables but instead a headboard with wings, the surfaces of which are not visible from the pillows below. In addition, even if our eyes were equipped with periscope vision, we're both at the age that we cannot see much of anything without corrective lenses. For the purpose of telling time at night, any alarm clock for us is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we awake in the middle of the night and want to know the time, we need to reach for respective clock (for my wife, her face-down eerie yellow-glowing Matrix digital, for me my little round radio-controlled analog) and hold it close enough to our face for us to read it. By this time, we're awake enough that we couldn't go back to sleep anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't yet even mentioned the most annoying alarm clock in the house‚Ä¶ a TALKING clock from that electronic super-store &lt;a href=&quot;http://tchibo.de/&quot;&gt;Tchibo&lt;/a&gt;. I bought it on a whim, but found the voice so EVIL that I immediately intended to throw it out‚Ä¶ but instead it ended up in our son's room. He sleeps in a high bed with no shelf for a clock, so he puts it in his bed against the sideboard. When he rolls over in the night, he rolls against the buttons and suddenly the clock starts speaking: &quot;THE TIME IS‚Ä¶ TWO‚Ä¶ FORTY-SEVEN!!!&quot; Our son sleeps through it, but the rest of us have to put up with random squawks of clock logic until one of us goes downstairs and extracts the talking clock from his bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That we then know exactly what the time is in the night is no solace.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John Gruber is wrong. I'm sure readers of Daring Fireball often thing he's wrong, especially when he talks about politics or the Yankees, but in this case he's wrong about fatherhood when he writes that when your son is eight years old &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2011/12/merry&quot;&gt;that's as good as it gets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's wrong. It keeps getting better and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our son is starting to become an adult and think for himself. Of course as parents we're the ones he challenges the most with his new ideas, and they're not always right, but they're his ideas. He has my sense of humor and laughs at my jokes. He is an environmentalist and has a deep sense of right and wrong, and he is persistent in convincing others that his right and wrong is right for everyone. He's so smart it's scary. Just the past 3 weeks he's aced 4 tests in various subjects at school, even in subjects that weren't his strongest. He's sometimes a bit of a pessimist. I'm hoping to convince him that it's easier to change the world when you think you can do it. But even now, I'm impressed and amazed by him and I can't wait for tomorrow to see what he will do and become next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he turns twelve today. Happy Birthday, Christopher!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Four Days of Christmas</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/12/23/four-days-of-christmas/"/>
   <updated>2011-12-23T18:51:14+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/12/23/four-days-of-christmas</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've been busy this month, as usual. When you have to the stress of owning a business, then the holiday stress that comes in December is almost relaxing by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the the holidays are almost here, we have 4 days to celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmas Eve&lt;/strong&gt; we'll to try avoid any last minute grocery shopping. We've have a simple dinner of Ragout Fin, then take Oma to the afternoon service at St. Michaelis in Hamburg, then return home for cookies, presents, and &lt;em&gt;Gl√ºhwein&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christmas Day&lt;/strong&gt; is relatively quiet. No guests, just some fondue in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Christmas Day&lt;/strong&gt; we're cooking goose for all the in-laws! Big Petersen Christmas party at our house. Presents and music galore (back in October the kids recorded a couple of songs for Oma which my brother-in-law has professionally mixed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd Christmas Day&lt;/strong&gt; is Christopher's birthday. We're taking him out on the town for the new Sherlock Holmes movie, a last walk through the Hamburg Christmas market, and dinner at the roller-coaster restaurant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schwerelos-zeitlos.de/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schwerelos &amp;amp; Zeitlos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Weightless and Timeless), where your meal rides on rails to your table. We'll see how that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it will be the 28th already, nearly time to get ready for New Year's Eve. Happy Holidays, no matter how many days you celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Unimaginable</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/11/19/unimaginable/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-19T10:10:55+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/11/19/unimaginable</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I've gotten back to one of my favorite pleasures¬Ö reading mystery novels. When we moved to Germany we shipped several boxes full of used paperbacks. These days with a Kindle, collecting novels is much easier. In case you're wondering, I've got Raymond Chandler complete ready to re-read, and lately re-read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Vintage-Crime-Black-Lizard-ebook/dp/B0036S4EVE/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1321642259&amp;amp;sr=1-3&quot;&gt;Blue City&lt;/a&gt;, an early Ross MacDonald. Right now I'm reading the delightful books by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Cotterill&quot;&gt;Colin Cotterill&lt;/a&gt; featuring Dr. Siri, the reluctant elderly coroner in post-war Laos (think CSI-Vientiane).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a love my wife and I both share (and judging form how he likes CSI-type shows, our son will as well). There's something about the combination of the extreme and banal, the murder and the police work, that a good author can use to make astute observations about society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now in Germany a real-life criminal case is giving ample opportunity for astute observations. A band of 3 neo-Nazis went underground 13 years ago and committed at least 14 bank robberies, 10 murders and 2 nailbombings. The facts have come out not through brilliant police work, but purely by chance. The last bank robbery 2 weeks ago was botched and 2 of the gang members shots themselves rather than be captured. The third tried to burn their apartment but turned herself in a couple of days later. You can read about it at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/18/how-german-neo-nazis-evaded-police&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/world/europe/neo-nazis-suspected-in-wave-of-crimes-in-germany.html&quot;&gt;NY Times&lt;/a&gt;, or follow the sensationalist coverage at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/topic/neo_nazi_terror_cell/&quot;&gt;Spiegel Online International&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly interesting because 1) the murders of foreign-born shopkeepers and the policewoman as well as the nailbombing in Cologne were high-profile crimes widely reported in the German media, and 2) German police and domestic intelligence have been particularly successful in infiltrating and stopping Islamist terror cells. Is German law enforcement blind to the right eye?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll let others answer that. I wouldn't necessarily call a conspiracy what could be sufficiently explained by incompetence. Noone is more paranoid of Germans being latent Nazis than Germans themselves. But if you read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schneier.com/&quot;&gt;Bruce Schneier&lt;/a&gt;, you'll know he thinks security forces concentrate too much on acts that have already occurred. They couldn't imagine terrorists that don't take credit for their acts, so they didn't consider the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the result of all the political calls for action will be that right-wing violence in Germany will finally be taken somewhat seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was impressed by the view from our back window this morning. The lawn was frozen and the fog was thick and this leafless tree seemed to be spiting it all. It's November, and the damp cold should come as no surprise. The heat is on and we've started lighting the wood stove in the evening. The holidays will be here before we know it, and we're talking about next year like it's just around the corner instead of the distant future. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Off The Rack</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/10/02/off-the-rack/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-02T17:57:38+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/10/02/off-the-rack</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Through soft living and not sticking to my gym schedule, I'm carrying 5 kilos more than 3 years ago and the suit I bought then is too tight around the belly. And the suit before that hangs like a tent. Why is fashion so unforgiving? But we have a gala event in Berlin to attend, and Christopher also needs the appropriate attire, so yesterday we were off to Hamburg to visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.policke-herrenkleidung.de/&quot;&gt;Policke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.policke-herrenkleidung.de/historisches-kaufhaus.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/02-01-11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;02 01  1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; style=&quot;float:right;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/12/11/advent-advent-ein-anzug-brennt/&quot;&gt;blogged about Policke&lt;/a&gt; 11 years ago when I got the suit before that. It hasn't changed much since then¬Ö&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mama was convinced that I needed a new suit for her company Christmas party next weekend (her first formal appearance after maternity leave, although she officially starts on January 2). My main criteria in choosing a profession was to avoid wearing suits. I hate buying clothes, but it¬ís even worse to discuss or even argue about buying clothes, so I kept my mouth shut (well, nearly shut) and went along with Mama and Christopher to Hamburg early on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went to Policke, an old-fashioned men¬ís clothier in Hamburg¬Ö not chic downtown Hamburg, but the nitty, gritty inner-city neighborhood of St. Georg, located across from a Turkish bank and some porno shops, between a mosque&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;mosque&quot; href=&quot;#footnote&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; and a Good Templar¬ís Club. The shop looks like it hasn¬ít been remodeled since the 1920s, and maybe the staff hasn¬ít changed since then either. There¬ís hardly room to move¬Ö the tiny rooms are stuffed with suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It¬ís impossible to browse. You are met at the door by the chief salesman, who measures your exact size by eye alone, and are sent to the appropriate room. I told the salesman there I need a dark colored suit for a Christmas party, he picked two out that both fit perfectly and met Mama¬ís approval. I picked one, and we were out in 15 minutes, paying a least a third less than we would have downtown, and were home before the crowds arrived in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the service was even quicker. The first suit tried on fit and was right, so I was done in 10 minutes, and I paid half of what I expected.. Same thing for Christopher: 10 minutes in and out, much cheaper than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more amazing¬Ö before we shopped, Christopher insisted he didn't need a suit and didn't want to go to any gala in any case. Today he spent 45 minutes trying his new suit on and admiring the look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a name=&quot;footnote&quot; href=&quot;#mosque&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;At first I was afraid the mosque was the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Mosque_Hamburg&quot;&gt;Al-Quds&lt;/a&gt; mosque where the 9/11 plotters met, but that was around the corner on Steindamm, a couple of blocks away. The mosque on the same street as Policke is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centrum-moschee.de/&quot;&gt;Centrum Mosque&lt;/a&gt;, and tomorrow they happen to be holding an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centrum-moschee.de/images/stories/diverse/tom_2011_plakat.pdf&quot;&gt;open house&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I've pretty much written everything I have to say about it, either &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/&quot;&gt;a day later in 2001&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/10/five-years/&quot;&gt;5 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, or even just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/09/11/inner-peace/&quot;&gt;2 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was an expat American in Hamburg in 2001, the city where the evil had spawned, and perhaps I was much closer to that evil than I really wanted to know. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/13/were-in-this-together/&quot;&gt;&quot;Amerikaner, wir sind bei euch&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (Americans, we stand by you) was the headline in the Hamburg paper the next day, and that was certainly comforting at the time. The only lasting consequence of that solidarity seems to be the military quagmire in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/16/sunday-at-home/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://papascott-de.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/09/hhcandles.jpg&quot; height=&quot;235&quot; width=&quot;345&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;hhcandles.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for these candles at the US Consulate in Hamburg, I don't think you can even get that close to consulate anymore. The street is closed, last time I was there we had to go past guards in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/11/02/terror-begins-at-home/&quot;&gt;tanks with machine guns&lt;/a&gt; to get in. Maybe that's all I need to say about how the world is different today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I'd just rather &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52mgnN9xfvA&quot;&gt;forget that day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Driving the E-Smart</title>

   <updated>2011-09-01T04:52:57+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/09/01/driving-the-e-smart</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925452164&quot; title=&quot;View 'https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6002/5925452164_d61e983360.jpg' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6002/5925452164_d61e983360.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6002/5925452164_d61e983360.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had our E-Smart (officially Smart Fortwo Electric Drive Cabriolet) for two months now, long enough to have had some experience with it. In short, we like it even more than we thought we would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't just go out an buy one, however. It's not available for general sale. We're participating in a cooperation between Daimler and McDonald's Deutschland that lets us participate in a test of using E-Smarts in corporate fleets. We lease and insure direct from Daimler, and I won't mention the price since I'm not sure it's representative of any market price. It's safe to say it's our most expensive company car. (Update: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smart.de/information-service-electric-drive-fragen-antworten/6bf159ed-0c58-5c54-855a-84b62adfdfaa&quot;&gt;E-Smart FAQ&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smart.de&quot;&gt;www.smart.de&lt;/a&gt; mentions a leasing rate of 700¬Ä per month, plus VAT.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic statistics: it has a range of 120 km on a full charge and a top speed of 100 km/h. It takes 8 hours to charge a completely empty battery at a standard 220V outlet, or 90 minutes at a high-voltage charging station. The proponents of electric mobility say these limitations are not limitations at all, that 99% of daily driving can be done without having to charge away from home. We've found that to be true, and our battery has never gone below 50%. When planning your trips, though, you're always keeping those limitations in mind, and we make sure it's always charged up. It's also a two-seater, so family trips are out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've found the E-Smart to be perfect for those short trips where gas and diesel are particularly inefficient. There's no warm-up time, the E-Smart is always ready to go. We live in the country, our grocery store is 3 km away, the school bus stop 4 km, Buchholz where we do most shopping 5 km. We can make those trips without feeling guilty at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for driving, it sounds and feels like riding an elevator or driving a bumper car. It has a one-speed transmission, so it never shifts gears, you just step on the accelerator and it goes. It will never win any drag races pulling from a stop light. It has air conditioning and a good (but not great) sound system that plays MP3s. And we can put the top down, though with this year's German non-summer we've done that exactly once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the operating costs, we've got a mini power-use counter on our outside outlet, so we know that we've driven about 2500 km on about 350 kWh. However, that does not count charges at the loading station in Rade (it's still in test and we aren't paying there yet). We pay about 23 cents per kWh for our eco-power at home, so that works out to about 3.25¬Ä per 100 km, which I figure is about half of what gas or diesel would cost. So it's not only fun and ecological, it's inexpensive too&amp;#42;. (*Not considering the purchase price.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are electric cars the wave of the future? I don't know. The car itself has no emissions, but power generating plant may be nuclear or coal, so you're just moving the pollution to where you can't see it. The high purchase prices make them uneconomical for most people right now. And I'm not sure how electric mobility fits in an energy policy that stresses conservation (particularly in Germany, which is giving up nuclear power). The future may be in hybrids, or a technology not involving a heavy battery. But it's worth trying out and thinking about, and our decorated E-Smart is turning heads.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sanity Time</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/08/18/sanity-time/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-18T03:39:35+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/08/18/sanity-time</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Forgive me, readers, for I have sinned. It's been over five weeks since my last post¬Ö&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our summer &quot;vacation&quot; was a busy as we suspected it would be. The restaurant in Rade, the truck stop store without a truck stop, is as busy as we hoped it would be. The self-serve &quot;Easy Order&quot; kiosks are in but are not being frequented that much yet (around 3% of guests). I suspect most people walk by not knowing what they are. Our first store in Dibbersen has been holding its own, down just a bit from last year despite having the brand new store just a few km away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it was our store in Harburg that gave us the nicest surprise. A couple of weeks ago we found our neighboring Burger King had subtly changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/non-bk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Non bk&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; style=&quot;float:right;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had become a non-Burger King. Apparently BK had cancelled their franchise. The restaurant is still open as a generic burger joint, but it doesn't look open and we're getting a surprise plus. Now we just need to get staffed to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we had sent our son to my parents in Minnesota for 3 weeks, after the success of his Easter voyage. He arrived just at the peak of the heat wave (110¬∞F), but it was cooler at the lake and he pretty much caught all the sunfish he could get (final count over 60). I flew over for the last few days of his visit to catch up with my folks and bring him home. It was nice to get a couple of days of sanity time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today school starts, our son is in the 6th grade, and our schedule gets back to &quot;normal&quot;, whatever normal turns out to be this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925439308&quot; title=&quot;View 'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/5925439308_3b1550f09c_m.jpg' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/5925439308_3b1550f09c_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/5925439308_dc47742365_m.jpg&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We've been open in Rade for over a week, and the good news is that sales are pretty much what we expected and that most stuff works. However it's been a hectic two weeks, full of major and minor disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction chaos: Standard construction time is 12 weeks, and 10 weeks would be extremely fast. We were built in 9 weeks, and actually less than that considering the holidays in May and June. Coordination among sub-contractors is always difficult, and was complicated by the accelerated schedule. Everyone seemed to be constantly waiting on somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925270734&quot; title=&quot;View 'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5925270734_939683fbdb_m.jpg' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:left;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5925270734_939683fbdb_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; src=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6017/5925270734_939683fbdb_m.jpg&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Telecommunications: The biggest disaster, and still not solved. The line was applied for in April, but it took over 8 weeks for our telephone and DSL providers (one is magenta, the other is red) to figure out 1) exactly where our site was located, 2) that we'd have a different area code than our postal address, and 3) DSL would not be available at the site until May 2012. It's perhaps a sad fact of modern times, but we can't sell hamburgers without a working data connection... specifically, to program and maintain our POS system. The situation is complicated by the fact that magenta and red don't talk directly to one another and always blame each other for whatever problems occur. The current status is that we'll get super-slow 300 Kbit DSL this week, in the meantime they cobbled a connection first with UMTS (3G cellular) and then over the landline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5925448352&quot; title=&quot;View 'http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6012/5925448352_927a122dfc_m.jpg&quot; height=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;POS System: As a result of the telecom woes, we didn't have a base POS system in place until 10 hours before opening with no time to test. The shaky data connection meant our help desk couldn't log in to us to fix the inevitable problems. The system crashed hard on close the first two nights. Our McCaf√© registers weren't properly connected to the system, and our Day 1 sales data for McCaf√© are gone. The operating system for the POS is brand new and pretty much undocumented. Our knowledge of the previous system is useless for the new system, so we were dependent on the help desk for setting things up for our requirements. Good thing for us the Easy Order kiosks did not arrive in time, that would have been just an added complication. Things pretty much work now, and we expect the kiosks by the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freezer: On Wednesday evening, Day 6 after opening, the refrigeration technician finished the final adjustments to our walk-in freezer and declared the installation for complete. The next morning the temperature inside was +5¬∞C. Our entire frozen stock worth over 14000¬Ä had to be destroyed. Our logistics partner brought us a freezer truck to store our new stock so we could get back in business right away. The original installers were never able to get the freezer up and running. On Saturday a new firm was brought in, and the found and fixed the problem within minutes. The installer had literally gotten the wires crossed. The freezer has been at a stable -22¬∞C for 48 hours, and we'll move our stock back inside today. Legally, the unit is under guarantee, and our costs will be covered by the general contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

Everything that we did and hired ourselves, our people, the lobby and patio design, the landscaping, the PR and local marketing, that has all been nearly perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The front door already looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lobby needs a little work, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5863520851&quot; title=&quot;View 'IMG_0314' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0314&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5270/5863520851_523d645cd4.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is going to be our McCaf√©?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5864072540&quot; title=&quot;View 'IMG_0313' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0313&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2704/5864072540_894b310f24.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll spare you the pictures from the kitchen. To us it looks like total chaos. But the construction experts tell us everything looks good for a week before opening. We're crossing our fingers until Monday, when we officially take over the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look outside. We have a nice Playland for the kids to crawl through. Just yesterday it was still packed on pallets on a truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5864070584&quot; title=&quot;View 'IMG_0311' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0311&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5110/5864070584_4efce48f59.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's always good to have asphalt in the Drive-Thru lane before the cars come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5863518763&quot; title=&quot;View 'IMG_0312' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0312&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2769/5863518763_961f06be7a.jpg&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems the general contractor has some understanding for our logo. That's a very good sign!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/5863516517&quot; title=&quot;View 'IMG_0310' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0310&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5272/5863516517_05486ef57c.jpg&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I almost forgot... the best thing is, our electric drive Smart has arrived. It will look better once we paste a bunch of Golden Arches on it! But we'll show it off on Sunday at our local Stadtlauf (city run).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are starting to get serious at the construction site. These pictures are already a few days old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's our opening day supervisor checking out the grand opening signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Autobahn it's pretty easy to tell what's happening here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Pfingstbaumfplanzen.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Pfingstbaumfplanzen.pdf&quot; alt=&quot;Pfingstbaumfplanzen&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pfingsbaumplanzen.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pfingsbaumplanzen&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I've mentioned the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/05/18/pfingstbaum/&quot;&gt;Pentecost traditions&lt;/a&gt; in our village in previous years. This year there seems to be a revitalized interest in village activities, for example the &lt;em&gt;Dorffest&lt;/em&gt; was newly organized and was a huge success with 10x the turnout of previous years. Last week a brochure &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Pfingstbaumfplanzen.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Pfingstbaumfplanzen.pdf&quot; alt=&quot;Pfingstbaumfplanzen&quot;&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Pfingstbaumfplanzen&lt;/em&gt; as PDF)&lt;/a&gt; was distributed to all houses explaining the tradition of planting Pentecost trees, which in our area is unique to our village. Here is my attempt at a translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/14489364/&quot; title=&quot;Pfingsbaum at Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos11.flickr.com/14489364_4e14656699_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;Pfingstbaum&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dear Villagers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Since Pentecost is almost here, we would like to explain to you, the new residents of the village, the custom of planting Pentecost trees (&lt;em&gt;Pfingstbaumpflanzen&lt;/em&gt;) and to you, the old residents, to remind you of the history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  The custom of planting Pentecost trees descends from an old tradition, in which the young men of the village, starting in  the year in which they are confirmed, can participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  They went from house to house and at the front doors of those families with unmarried daughters they placed a freshly cut young birch tree and sang traditional songs in order to introduce themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Today, in the time of single exchanges, personal ads and the Internet, the custom has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Today, on Pentecost Saturday the bachelors of L√ºllau between ages 14 as 30 go from house to house through the village and place freshly cut young birch trees at the houses and sing traditional songs. After the song the eldest recites a saying. Then the residents of the house treat the young men to a glass of schnaps or a sum of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Until Saturday,&lt;br /&gt;
  Your &lt;em&gt;Pfingsbaumfplanzer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/05/30/pentecost-singers/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;pent2004.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://papascott-de.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/05/pent2004.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; On Sunday, the boys and girls come in separate groups as the &lt;em&gt;Pfingstvoss&lt;/em&gt;-Singers. They also sing songs and get in return a sum of money or candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  These traditions are also documented in the L√ºllau Chronicle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had schnaps and Mini-Dickmann candy ready for the men on Saturday, but they must have gotten behind schedule. We went to bed at 11 pm without having seen them, but the next morning the freshly cut birch was at our door.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had a chance to visit the new restaurant on Sunday. There's now security watching over the site, but he was nice enough to let us in for some pictures. Here's the front counter and kitchen area.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Plan Doesn't Come Together</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/05/04/the-plan-doesnt-come-together/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-04T14:07:39+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/05/04/the-plan-doesnt-come-together</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over Easter vacation our son flew to the US for the first time alone to visit his grandparents. It was only for a week, we drove him to Amsterdam (5 hours each way) so he'd be able to fly non-stop and not sit in a strange airport by himself. Turned out he loved it, one week was way too short, and he'd fly by himself again anytime. His grandparents are willing to host him anytime (of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/30/groundbreak/&quot;&gt;big plans&lt;/a&gt; for the summer, we won't be able to take a family vacation, so we're thinking that maybe he can fly back to the States for a couple weeks before school starts, and so that his grandparents (my parents) won't forget what their son (me) looks like, I could fly in for a few days to pick him up. So I started looking at &lt;a href=&quot;http://kayak.com/&quot;&gt;Kayak&lt;/a&gt; for flight prices, and suffered a sudden attack of sticker shock. Four-figure sticker shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between high fuel prices, high season, and new German departure taxes, flights from Hamburg to Minneapolis in July and August start at over 1000¬Ä. Flights from any other German city are the same, and from Amsterdam is even more expensive. One exception was Icelandic, which has occasional flights from Hamburg this summer. They had a deal on some sites for 830¬Ä, if you will willing to handle an 8 hour layover in Keflavik (which is I guess why the Icelandic site itself doesn't list it, and is not appropriate for an unaccompanied minor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to creative, I start looking at airports in neighboring countries, and see that flights from Copenhagen to Minneapolis start from the low 800¬Äs. Copenhagen is just 300km away, train there costs 30¬Ä, a commuter flight about 100¬Ä round trip. Could that work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devil is in the details. The flights are in the morning or early afternoon. The cheap commuter flights are in the evening. The train takes 5 hours (there's a body of water in the way, so the train crosses the Fehmarn Belt by ferry), and with the airport connection would not make it in time for check-in. Taking an early commuter flight would eat up almost all the savings while making the trip more complicated (an extra stop with re-check-in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might just have to bite the bullet and pay the four figures.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Groundbreak</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/30/groundbreak/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/30/groundbreak</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've been keeping a secret for the past several months, and it can now finally be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/bautyp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bautyp&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;434&quot; height=&quot;274&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're pleased to announce that construction has begun for our 4th McDonald's restaurant! It will be located on the Autobahn A1 at Rade, the first exit from Hamburg heading towards Bremen. We expect to open at the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/map.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Map&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;466&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/limfresh.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Limfresh&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;331&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;The restaurant with McCaf√© will be part of an Autohof, a truck stop and gas station, and our logo will appear on official Autobahn signage leading to the Autohof. Over 70,000 cars per day pass Rade on the Autobahn. It also fills a hole in the McDonald's map. From the west, the nearest restaurant is at Bockel, 44 km away. To the east, our restaurant at Dibbersen is less than 8 km away, but with the Autobahn crossing &quot;Buchholzer Dreieck&quot; between the two stores, they have completely different traffic patterns. Traffic from the Elbtunnel heading south drive past Rade, but not Dibbersen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be part of the LogPark Hamburg, a logistics center currently under construction on both sides of the Autobahn. We'll be located alongside the eastbound lane before the exit, so we'll be impossible to miss. We won't need an overly large sign to be visible from 2 km away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/easyoder.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Easyorder&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;289&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;The current standard building type in Germany features a green exterior with wood trim and all the latest energy-saving innovations. We've chosen a colorful &quot;LIM Fresh&quot; interior for an expected 130 seats inside and 70 seats outside. Among the extras we've chosen are touch-screen &quot;Easy Order&quot; kiosks to enable guests to enter and pay for their orders before coming to the counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/stromtanken.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stromtanken&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;229&quot; height=&quot;335&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;A special innovation will the charging station for electric vehicles, only the 5th of its kind at German McDonald's. You'll be able to charge your battery with eco-power while enjoying your meal. We'll be adding an electric car to our company fleet. With a top speed of 100 kmh and a range of 130 km, it should be perfect for driving between our 4 restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/esmart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Esmart&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;224&quot; height=&quot;146&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;We've been discussing the site with McDonald's for over a year, and we're very happy that we'll be open for the entire school vacation season this summer. The Autohof won't be completed until this fall, so things will be a bit dusty for the first few months. Right now we have the first big challenge: finding 70 new employees in a booming economy to be set to open in 10 weeks. Wish us luck!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Road Construction</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/21/road-construction/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-21T04:35:03+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/21/road-construction</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Normally our village is pretty quiet. We only have 4 streets, none of which are paved, a couple dozen houses, and no shops at all (no bakery, no post office, no grocer, no gas station) other than a bio farmer who sells asparagus in the spring and Christmas trees in December. This is the usual layout...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/gmap-luellau.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gmap luellau&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for the past six weeks the county roads going through our village have been under construction, and it looks more like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/gmap-luellau-baustelle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gmap luellau baustelle&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark red is completely closed. They're building a rain drainage pond to the right and big drainage pipes under the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of the county roads is being turned into a traffic circle. One lane is available through the crossing regulation, only one direction can drive through at a time, regulated by traffic lights (dots).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile a bicycle path is being built on the county road starting in our village and heading off several km to the north. For us that means the sidewalk is being widened and the street narrowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end effect is that the traffic that normally turns south at the crossing redirects itself onto our cobblestone streets. It's not a marked detour, but people take it anyway, ignoring the no-trucks sign and the 30 kmh speed limit. (The road marked Sand is just a tractor path and leads nowhere unless you're an asparagus picker.) We can hear traffic past our house starting at 6am, just after the early-morning birds stop chirping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction should be done in early June, and until then we won't be needing our alarm clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The same day this was posted, the circle was opened to traffic in all directions. No more unofficial detours on our street! Hooray! &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quiet Week</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/14/quiet-week/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-14T18:35:54+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/14/quiet-week</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's going to be a quiet week for us next week, the week before Easter. Not that we don't have enough to do, we have plenty of that. But our son is going to be away the entire week. He's flying by himself, for the first time, to Minnesota to visit his grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed during our visit last summer that he was doing very well communicating in English, and, of course, as for any child his grandparents are the greatest. So we decided that this spring would be the right time for the first big trip alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're sure the airline will take good care of unaccompanied minors (especially for the price!), but to minimize the risk of mistakes we are driving him to Amsterdam so he can fly non-stop to Minnesota, and will drive there again in a week to pick him up. Annoyingly, the direct flight from Amsterdam costs more than it would have to fly one-stop (in Amsterdam) from Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're all three feeling mostly excited but a just little bit scared. It's good that we we planned this trip for him alone, since the way our business looks we won't be able to get away for a family trip this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our son will return home on Easter Saturday, so he can be at our local Easter fire with his Youth Fire Dept. comrades. He does, after all, have to keep his obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Accidental Shots</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/10/accidental-shots/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/04/10/accidental-shots</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had sponsor tickets for yesterday's HSV match against Dortmund (we applied for the tickets last summer, so I obviously knew in advance that Dortmund would do well this year). I couldn't connect to Twitter in the stadium, so you'll have to take our word for it that we were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was shining, the Dortmund fans were plentiful and in a good mood (Christopher thought it was funny that they were singing children's songs with, um, slightly altered lyrics), and in the end noone lost, so a good time was had by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought along our new camera, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004026PE4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=papascott-21&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1638&amp;amp;creative=19454&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004026PE4&quot;&gt;Canon PowerShot SX130 IS&lt;/a&gt;, to see how the zoom worked. Not bad for a 150¬Ä general purpose camera, but all you can do is point at a spot, hope for the action to get there, and get an accidental shot. The picture of Frank Rost cleaning the toilet paper out of his goal before kickoff is good, though.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Green Card</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/03/30/green-card/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-30T19:13:08+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/03/30/green-card</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/
03/greencard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Greencard&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;My wife had incredibly bad luck with her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uscis.gov/greencard&quot;&gt;green
card&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/09/young-dumb-and-
excited/&quot;&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt; that she arrived in the US with a fianc√©e visa which, once the
fianc√©e bit is consummated, so to speak, entitles one to permanent
residence and a green card. The physical card was the problem. The INS
managed to misspell her name on the card three times before finally
getting it right, several months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy come, easy go. A couple of weeks after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/09/as-the-wall-fell/&quot;&gt;we moved to Germany in
1990&lt;/a&gt;, we
took a day trip to Berlin to see what all the fuss was about. We got
completely lost in the Friedrichstra√üe S-Bahn station (where the
passport control for Westerners used to be, the maze of hallways were
still there but absolutely no signs), and once we got out, her purse was
stolen. Passport, ID, and green card, all gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reported everything stolen, but we never had the green card replaced,
since she was no longer a resident of the US, much less a permanent
resident. We figured that was a detail we could take care of when we
moved back the the States. As it turned out, that hasn‚Äôt happened yet.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those following along with the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/03/23/lingua-franca/&quot;&gt;which language will Christopher learn in the 6th grade&lt;/a&gt;&quot; contest, we have a winner. A full week before the deadline, he declared his decision for Latin, and we turned in the form to the school today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our preference was for French, and we even tried using to some reverse psychology (pointing out the advantages of Latin and hoping he'd argue with us), but that backfired. The main thing is that he made a decision and is happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who gave suggestions and played along.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lingua franca</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/03/23/lingua-franca/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-23T12:20:25+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/03/23/lingua-franca</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/em&gt; schools in our state, students start learning a second foreign language (after English) in grade 6. The schools we looked at all offered a choice from Latin, French and Spanish. The public schools all required a choice upon enrollment in the 5th grade, over a year before the courses would actually begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Christopher's private school, they don't need to choose until April 1 of their 5th grade year. After winter break, the students had a chance to try out all 3 languages for a couple of days to help them make their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result for Christopher is... he wants to learn all 3, Latin, French and Spanish, and preferably Russian as well, but that's not a choice. :-)  So here we are one week before deadline, and we haven't made a decision yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish will be offered as a 3rd language starting in 10th grade, so he can start that later. So now he's trying to decide between French and Latin, and he can't make up his mind. We'd prefer that he take a language that's spoken rather than most written, given his stutter, but he's not willing to let us decide for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/papascott/status/49937345893507072&quot;&gt;quick poll on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; the other night. The approximate counts were 8 for French, 5 for Latin (although a couple of votes seemed facetious), 2 for Spanish. One joke vote for German was not accepted. We'll let you know how it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/02/27/music-snob</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/Sempe-Keine-Klassik-Aber-Gef%C3%A4llt/dp/B0037L0D1K&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ich-mag-keine-klassik-aber-das-gefaellt-mir-various.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ich mag keine klassik aber das gefaellt mir various&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The past several weeks our son has been obsessed with classical music. I suspect it has something to do with the music instruction at his new school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't come from us. Our consumption of classical music is close to zero. My wife currently has Rihanna and Katy Perry on heavy rotation in her car. Should you ever have the opportunity to drive her car, it is highly recommended to turn the music volume down before touching the ignition, if you value your sense of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started taking keyboard classes last fall, and with some Christmas money we got him a basic Yamaha keyboard. It has some canned classical pieces in memory, F√ºr Elisa, Wilhelm Tell, and stuff like that. He'd listen to them and try to play along. I finally got him a CD with some real recordings (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/Sempe-Keine-Klassik-Aber-Gef%C3%A4llt/dp/B0037L0D1K&quot;&gt;&quot;I don't like classic but I like this&quot;&lt;/a&gt;) so we don't have to listen to the tinny keyboard playback anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he came home telling us about Mozart and opera and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/Mozart-Zauberfl%C3%B6te-Gesamtaufnahme-Aufnahme-1993/dp/B0000260AD&quot;&gt;The Magic Flute&lt;/a&gt; and that he'd really like to see it sometime. It just so happened that a traveling ensemble presented The Magic Flute at our local theatre this month, and since then we have the CD and have to listen to opera every morning for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this week his school presented an evening with two concert pianists playing Haydn which we had to attend (without Mama, for her that was too much). And now when we hear a good song on the radio, and we tell him &quot;That's a song from when we were young, that's an oldie&quot;, he answers, &quot;Not as old as my music!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, it didn't come from us. Maybe he was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ladygaga.com/discography/detail.aspx?pid=2912&quot;&gt;born this way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Save the World</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/02/05/save-the-world/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-05T04:21:17+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/02/05/save-the-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago, I entered college with a mission: I was going to Save the World! I was fresh from a summer in northeastern Brazil as an AFS student and had experienced what the difference between rich and poor really is. Coming from the richest and most powerful country on earth, I was going to have the knowledge and the power to do good, to facilitate change, to make the world a better place. I was going to study International Relations! I was going to learn Diplomacy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to the nitty gritty content, there were a lot of paradoxical truths to be learned. Like that Mutual Assured Destruction was a good thing and that nuclear weapons made the world a safer place. And that politics is a zero-sum game, so that preventing your opponent from gaining something was just as good as winning. And that a big problem in developing countries are the elite classes in those countries themselves, who either run the country corruptly or go abroad to study and never come back. And another big problem are agricultural subsidies in rich countries, which distort the entire world market for farm commodities and make it impossible for poor countries to feed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all quite depressing, really. I decided that the studying the relationship between money and power was more interesting and satisfying that saving the world, and switched majors from International Relations to Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention all this now because even then the US was supporting the dictator Hosni Mubarak in Egypt to the tune of billions of dollars per year, and in the twisted logic of Diplomacy it made perfect sense then as it did until about two weeks ago. And the people running US foreign policy today are people my age who 30 years ago wanted to save the world. Maybe they've switched to other goals. Or maybe they know that in the long run, it's a better policy to foster democracy than to prop up dictators with billions of dollars, but they just don't how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in Economics we say that in the long run, we're all dead. When comparing two long runs, we don't know which one will come first. It's all quite depressing, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not everything is depressing... it's quite heartening to see millions of Egyptians demonstrating for democracy. I hope they are not disappointed, and that they don't have to wait for the long run for their freedom&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stranded!</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/01/16/stranded/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-16T21:33:40+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/01/16/stranded</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday we accepted delivery for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.volkswagen.de/de/models/sharan.html&quot;&gt;Volkswagen Sharan&lt;/a&gt; that we ordered 6 months ago (with a lot of extras but without the automatic doors like in the cute commercial). It will be my company car for the next three years. Our family isn't really big enough for a mini-van, but there are times we need the space, either for business or for pleasure. I'd love to show it to you, but right now all I have is this fuzzy smartphone photo...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sharan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sharan.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...because the day after we picked up the car, with 325 km on the odometer, it had to be towed from the Autobahn to the shop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on my way to L√ºneburg to pick up our son from school for an appointment, enjoying the music from the very loud speakers, when at 180 km/h the (manual) transmission suddenly popped out of gear and wouldn't go back in. All I could do was coast to the side of the road and call for help, and arrange for an alternate pick-up for our son. My wife was out of town, so she couldn't step in (but she did contact her brother to pick up our son from the bus, and I was able to reach the school to tell him to take the bus instead of waiting for me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I was told that the transmission was blocked for some unexplained reason and will be completely replaced. The car will probably be ready on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say that VW Service performed as well as I could expect. Within 30 minutes I was being towed to the nearest VW dealer, and 1 hour later I was on my way home with a free loaner car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've leased all our cars from Volkswagen since starting our business, even for the franchisee herself, and we have a good relationship with our local VW dealer. We're sure this is a one-off problem, and even if not we'll be able to resolve it to our satisfaction. But I have to admit I'll be a bit hesitant the first time I bring the Sharan to full speed when we have it back.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Back in Black</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/01/12/back-in-black/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-12T21:27:43+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/01/12/back-in-black</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the several good effects of our son's new school is that he has developed an enthusiasm for music. We didn't take him to any special music classes earlier (it's something we didn't think of, since neither of us did it as kids, maybe that was a missed opportunity), but with his very first music class at the new school, he decided he it was time to learn an instrument. One of his music teachers offers weekly after-school keyboard lessons, and our son was the first to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(After school means he misses the bus home and we have to pick him up. Remember the school is a 45 minute drive from our home. Calculate how much fuel we burn to foster his interest in music. When I complain about my Friday taxi-driving schedule, this is what I mean.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of months of lessons, he outgrew the cheapy keyboard from the supermarket, so armed with some birthday money from Grandma we invested in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://usa.yamaha.com/products/musical-instruments/keyboards/digitalkeyboards/portable_keyboards/psr-e223/&quot;&gt;Yamaha E223 keyboard&lt;/a&gt;... still low-end, but much better than what we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we were at the music store (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.musikmarkthamburg.de/&quot;&gt;Musik Markt Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, by the way), I decided to scratch an itch I've had for a while. I haven't done anything with music for 30 years, since playing bass clarinet in the high school band. I really enjoyed it then, and seeing how our son is having so much fun with it, I thought maybe I could get back into it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I bought a bass guitar and an amp. Here we are showing of our new instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Foto-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boys in Black&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;438&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister-in-law's response: is there anything black left on the shelves? (Yes, I'm color-blind, and I am invariably attracted to black. It's the only color I'm sure I see correctly. And if it were red it would be a midlife crisis.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bass is a Yamaha RBX170, a decent and versatile beginners' bass, with a Marshall MBB15 amp, which is enough to practice in the basement. My knowledge of bass is starting from zero, and so far I've learned the strings are E-A-D-G and that I'll have to hang weights on my left-hand fingers to get them to stretch enough to cover four frets. I have a couple of books, and can still read music, so we'll see how far I can get by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile our son is trying to follow along to Beethoven (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_to_Joy&quot;&gt;Ode to Joy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BCr_Elise&quot;&gt;F√ºr Elise&lt;/a&gt;), listens to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_(Vivaldi)&quot;&gt;The Four Seasons&lt;/a&gt;, and insisted we get tickets to a tour of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Flute&quot;&gt;The Magic Flute&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to Buchholz next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he says he's ready to start a second instrument. The violin.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Extremism in Defense of Liberty</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/01/10/extremism-in-defense-of-liberty/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-10T21:41:15+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/01/10/extremism-in-defense-of-liberty</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we attended the New Year's Reception given by the mayor of Buchholz. It was a typical political meet-and-greet event, with all the usual suspects in attendance: the county commissioner (&lt;em&gt;Landrat&lt;/em&gt;), 2 members of the Bundestag, 1 member of the &lt;i&gt;Landestag&lt;/i&gt; (Lower Saxony Parliament). There was shake-hands with the mayor, a glass &lt;i&gt;Sekt&lt;/i&gt;, live music on stage, and a couple of optimistic speeches. Other than the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/images?q=amtskette&quot;&gt;Amtskette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; the mayor was wearing, it could have been a typical American political event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could have been a political event like the meet-and-greet in Tucson where Representative Giffords was shot and six people were killed by a lone gunman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much speculation that the poisoned polarization of American politics may have contributed to the atmosphere that makes such a shooting possible. I think it is unfair to solely blame a certain ex-governor of Alaska for this poisoned climate. After all, the left was all too happy to demonize the G. W. Bush administration (although, demonization has been ratcheted up a couple of notches since the last election).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany I have come to appreciate the multi-party parliamentary political system that values compromise over rhetoric. You cannot demonize your opponent, since your opponent today might be your coalition partner tomorrow. German parties debate the details, but not the basics, of democracy. Right now I have the feeling the American parties do not agree on the basics. And if you can't live with each other, what's left to live for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not now (and may never) understand the motivation of the madman from Tucson. But Arizona (as a state of immigrants from both inside and outside the US) is a Geiger counter for American politics. &quot;Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice&quot;, said Barry Goldwater, presidential candidate from Arizona. Right now I'm hoping for some extremism in defense of moderatism.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, it's not really bacon, just low-fat diced ham, but this recipe from our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myline24.de/&quot;&gt;My Line fitness program&lt;/a&gt; has become our favorite way to eat Brussels sprouts, even as a main dish! The original recipe is metric, the American equivalents are approximate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500 g (1 lb) Brussels sprouts&lt;br /&gt;
1 onion, chopped&lt;br /&gt;
1 Tsp olive oil&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Grocery Shopping</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/01/05/grocery-shopping/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-05T04:17:49+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/01/05/grocery-shopping</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With my wife and I both having busy and hectic schedules (well, hers is more hectic, mine is mostly pushing paper), coordinating grocery shopping is a constant challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a completely low-tech method of compiling a grocery list: a piece of paper tacked to the side of the refrigerator where we note the staples we're running low on (although &quot;running low&quot; is relative, we could have 1-1/2 cartons of eggs in the house, and my wife will still add eggs to the list). When writing on paper on a sideways wall, there's a 10% chance of any particular item being illegible, just to add some randomness to the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another source of randomness is whether one has remembered to bring the list to the store. This is quite logical; when leaving for work, one is thinking about the things one wants to do at work, not about the grocery list. When one is done at work, one thinks &quot;I could buy groceries on the way home&quot;, but one doesn't have the list, and one has to wing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at this point some smarty-pants is going to tell us to use a mobile app to create a synced shopping list. But what would that mean? That means our shopping list would depend on the internet! What if the internet goes down? We wouldn't be able to go shopping, and we'd starve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I will go medium-tech and take a picture of the list with my cell phone. But this can lead to yet another complication: double shopping, since if I take a picture of the list, the list is still there for the next person. We then both spontaneously come up with of idea of going shopping at the same time without telling one another and we end up with 45 eggs in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once in a great while the system works. I remember to bring the list, everything is legible, everything is in stock at the store, and I can cross everything off the list. But invariably that evening we'll find we can't cook because something is missing and my wife will ask me incredulously, &quot;How can you only buy what's on the list?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to guess what should be on the list but isn't is an exercise left to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Christmas Card</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/12/24/christmas-card/"/>
   <updated>2010-12-24T09:30:20+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/12/24/christmas-card</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As usual, I prepared our Christmas greetings for our friends and relatives in the US at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cardstore.com/&quot;&gt;CardStore&lt;/a&gt;, which lets us upload pictures and prepare a text and saves us the trouble of filling out envelopes and paying international postage. Also as usual, PapaScott readers get the inside scoop first...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/crh_dez_2010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;crh, Dez. 2010&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2010 is ending for us the same way it began... with snow! With airports closed, trains running late, and highways clogged throughout Europe, we're happy to be staying put for the holidays this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ended up staying put in April as well (thanks to Icelandic volcanic ash) when we planned to fly to Florida for the McDonald's International Convention. Next one is in 2012. We were able to make it to Minnesota in July to see Grandma and Grandpa, with side trips to Arizona and San Francisco. Our fall meeting was in Greece, but we had no time for sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August we finally celebrated our 25th anniversary (2 years late) with a catered barbecue. We were happy to have Grandma and my cousin here for the festivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our son turns 11 this month and is in the 5th grade. In Germany that means he has graduated to Gymnasium (middle school). To take advantage of smaller classes and more individual attention, he's at a private school that's a 45 minute bus ride away. This fall he's already read the entire Harry Potter series in German and is now half-way through in English. He's also developing an interest in music that we'll have to make sure we nurture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our three restaurants are doing fine (at least when it doesn't snow) and keep us both busy. If things go as planned we'll open a new restaurant on the Autobahn this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our present to ourselves this year was a modern wood stove for our living room. It has glass on 3 sides so we can always see the flames (if we keep the glass clean). Luckily we ordered a cord of firewood before the snow started, so we're ready for a cold winter!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I had just started college, I was working at the student radio station at the U of M.

   <title>Got Your Back</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/11/15/got-your-back/"/>
   <updated>2010-11-15T21:20:32+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/11/15/got-your-back</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was this time about 4 years ago (November 2006) that I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/06/pinch-my-grits/&quot;&gt;feeling strange pains in my back&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, they were in my legs and butt, and I was too dumb to realize they were really coming from my back. And I was too dumber &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/08/needles-and-pins/&quot;&gt;to go to a proper orthopedist&lt;/a&gt; until 2 months later, who diagnosed a pinched nerve in my lower back, and it took another 2 months of shots and therapy to actually relieve the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, as a kind of &quot;it can't do any harm and could do some good&quot; measure I signed up for a back therapy course at our local fitness center &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportland-buchholz.de/&quot;&gt;Sportland in Buchholz&lt;/a&gt;, with a group mostly 20+ years my senior. Part of the course was a back-strength check from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dr-wolff.de/&quot;&gt;Dr. Wolff&lt;/a&gt;, and my values were at first well in the red. Eight weeks later I had barely made it into the yellow area, so I had some work ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I lapsed in my training, so exactly one year after my first episode I suffered a relapse of my back pain, which unfortunately coincided with two trans-Atlantic flights. Eight hours of sitting in a plane with a pinched nerve can only be a special level of hell never imagined by Dante.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention all this now only because for the past year I've been more or less consistent with my training (mostly less), and just re-took the Dr. Wolff back-strength test. My strength values were all green. My triceps are somewhat weak, and my left side is stronger than my right, but the absolute values are OK. And I haven't felt any symptoms of back pain in nearly 3 years. Having gone through that hell, I'm happy not to have to deal with it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My weight isn't yet optimal, and that plays a big factor as well. But it's gotten better. I weighed 106 kg when my back problems began, and I'm at 93 kg now. I'm still above my ideal BMI, but I'm much better than I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back pain is one of the major health problems in middle age. I've been able to beat it by reducing my weight and increasing my back strength. That strategy could work for others as well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>We didn't know anything then</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/10/25/we-didnt-know-anything-then/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-25T18:57:14+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/10/25/we-didnt-know-anything-then</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The reports this past the weekend of the WikiLeaks documents showing how the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks&quot;&gt;US ignored torture in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; made me sad. Not so much that that it came as a surprise, but rather that it came as no surprise. And it made me think of what I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/24/how-did-we-get-into-this-mess/&quot;&gt;the Iraq war before it began&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I¬ím no great fan of George W. Bush, and my own opinion on Iraq is ambivalent. I can¬ít think of a good reason to use force against Iraq, but then again, I can¬ít think of a good reason not to, either. The attack on Iraq is inevitable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ambivalence back then was the hope that, despite my doubts that sending in troops can solve any problem, that deposing Saddam Hussein was a noble cause, that we were the good guys, that it was 1938 all over again and this time we would stop Hitler before he annexed the Sudetenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process, however, we've lost the moral high ground. Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, waterboarding, &quot;targeted killings&quot; carried out by drones... and the war we started caused over 100,000 Iraqi deaths. It's not 1938, and if you have to impose democracy on a country then just maybe it's not democracy anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the war I was ambivalent. What we didn't know then is that we didn't know anything then.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thus Spake The Poodle</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/09/15/the-poodle-is-watching/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Der_Pudel-224x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Poodle&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I promised to explain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/09/15/the-poodle-is-watching/&quot;&gt;the poodle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend the 5th annual Whiney Expat Blogger Meet-Up was held in Hamburg. Tradition holds that once a date and location are decided (by democratic vote in a process somewhat similar in length and complexity to choosing a US presidential candidate), the local bloggers, in this case &lt;a href=&quot;http://lettershometoyou.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://noapathyallowed.com/&quot;&gt;No Apathy Allowed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://transkitten.com/&quot;&gt;Transkitten&lt;/a&gt; and I, plan the weekend.  Over the years a successful formula for the weekend has evolved: a side-trip on Friday, dinner Friday evening, a walking tour Saturday morning followed by lunch, disco nap in the afternoon, dinner and (gay) bar hopping Saturday night, and brunch on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year for walking tour we called in professional help, an excellent decision since even we natives learned new things about the most beautiful city in the world (as the city is modestly referred to by its residents). Something new for us all was the poodle. The shipping magnate Carl Laeisz placed the poodle atop his company's headquarters, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hamburgwiki.de/wiki/Laeiszhof&quot;&gt;Laeiszhof&lt;/a&gt; on the Nikolaifleet in honor of his wife, whose nickname was &quot;poodle&quot;. He even gave all his ships names beginning with &quot;P&quot;, a tradition &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laeisz.de/en/index.html&quot;&gt;the company&lt;/a&gt; continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women in the group all agreed that they wished their men would similarly honor them, and the poodle became the official mascot of the weekend. One of them even took to giving commands as the poodle in the third person, as in &quot;The poodle demands your attention&quot;, &quot;The poodle is not amused&quot;, until finally, at the end of the evening, &quot;The poodle has left the building&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, for me the honor would be counter-productive, as I would have to erect and statue of a mouse atop our restaurants, and as the move &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hamburgwiki.de/wiki/Laeiszhof&quot;&gt;Ratatouille&lt;/a&gt; shows, rodents and gastronomy do not mix.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It Was Twenty Years Ago Today</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/09/01/it-was-twenty-years-ago-today/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-01T03:02:13+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/09/01/it-was-twenty-years-ago-today</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this day in 1990 we arrived in Germany, with all the suitcases we could carry plus 3 cats, the rest of our belongings in a half-container on a slow boat, for what we thought would be a 3 to 5 year stint. Saddam had just invaded Kuwait, Germany had just won the World Cup, and we still didn't know who had killed Laura Palmer. Germany was still in two pieces, but the marriage papers had just been signed the day before and the party would be in a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to Germany was an impulse decision, and it was better to be lucky than good. We were in the right place at the right time, reunified Germany was where the action was. Change was happening before our eyes and history was being made at our feet. We had left the US during that decade's banking crisis and the beginning of a war. The US was slow and broken down; Germany was &lt;em&gt;exciting&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We landed first in a run-down top-floor apartment in Kiel with a 4 month lease. We thought we'd be heading to Berlin, but it became clear we'd be staying in Hamburg. Housing was tight, the whole country was on the move, and 50 people would show up for an apartment showing. I think in the end someone pulled a string for us, and we moved into a 3 room apartment in Barmbek just as the slow boat with our belongings pulled up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My introduction to German life was total immersion. There was no internet, and I knew no other expats. I was naive and optimistic enough to believe that my American degree and determination would be enough to get a job. In the end it worked, but it took 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder sometimes if today, we were 20 years younger and the same opportunity came up again, we would make the same decision. Times have changed. I somehow doubt it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next weekend we are finally celebrating our silver wedding anniversary. As you may recall, the actual anniversary was in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/09/08/oslo-cruise/&quot;&gt;September 2008&lt;/a&gt;. So in the spirit of procrastination, the event is entitled &quot;Twenty-Five Plus&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treibhaus-marxen.de/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NewImage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Treibhaus.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;120&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We both have memories of stiff and boring anniversaries that we were forced to endure as children, so we are trying to do the opposite. We'll be at one of our favorite restaurants, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treibhaus-marxen.de/&quot;&gt;Treibhaus in Marxen&lt;/a&gt;, which as the name implies is very green and casual. We're serving &quot;American Barbeque&quot;, outside if the weather allows. We're celebrating in the afternoon and will be done by sunset, not partying into the wee hours of the &lt;s&gt;night&lt;/s&gt; morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two special visitors from the States, my mother and my cousin. My cousin has never been to Germany, so we will also be conducting a whirlwind &quot;German essentials in 6 days&quot; tour concluding with a cruise on the Rhine (special request from my mother). Our son has a class trip all next weeks, so that fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also been able bring our &quot;Basement Project 2009&quot; to a belated tentative conclusion. We had hoped to have business storage space and a guest room with bath done last winter, but the bad weather put us back and, well, the painter just finished up last week. The business space still needs some electrical work and shelving, but we made a trip to Ikea yesterday, and Voila! The guest room is now livable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now my project is to create a &quot;25+ Playlist&quot; of early '80s music for our Sonos S5 with which to entertain (or possibly torment) our guests. Can you sing along to &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>There and Back Again</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/07/12/there-and-back-again/"/>
   <updated>2010-07-12T05:17:57+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/07/12/there-and-back-again</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don't follow us on the Twitters, we spent the last two weeks on our annual US trip, which this time included stops in Phoenix and San Francisco before visiting my family in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspected when booking that flying outbound through both Paris and Atlanta would be a mistake. Air France departed 3 hours late from Paris on a cramped an aging 747 (the only thing good was the food), and the last place on earth you want to miss a connection is Atlanta. Delta managed to find room for us on the last flight of the evening, so we got into Phoenix 6 hours late, with moods to match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona was our last US station (1989-90) before coming to Germany, and is always a nostalgic what-would-have-been-if-we-had-never-left experience. We love the heat and the desert, but the politics and economy leave a lot to be desired. We caught up with an old friend and soaked up some 115¬∞F heat,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco is a station from my childhood (we lived in San Jose from 1st to 6th grade until 1974), and my wife's running joke was that I never took her there. It's not quite like I remember it. We stayed 3 days, time enough for the touristy things (stayed at Fisherman's Wharf, biked the Golden Gate Bridge, rode the cable cars, visited Alcatraz and the Exploratorium) but leaving much to explore should we ever return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in Minnesota we paid a visit to Target Field (stadium is nice, Twins suck at the moment) then spent a beautiful and quiet week at the lake. Christopher had a blast, and we could tell that he's now old enough and competent enough at English that we could send him alone to Grandma and Grandpa for some upcoming school vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically we connected an old unlocked iPhone to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/go-phones/index.jsp&quot;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T pay-as-you-go&lt;/a&gt; to stay in touch. We forwarded our business calls via Skype to ignore most of them and return the important ones, and a 100MB data package handled our email when we were out of WLAN range (for iPhone use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unlockit.co.nz/&quot;&gt;unlockit.co.nz&lt;/a&gt; to set the APN). My wife succumbed to the lure of the iPad, and we were able to manipulate the waiting list at the Apple Store to get her one in Minneapolis on her departure date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Delta flight home via Amsterdam was the opposite of our Air France experience (bad food, everything else OK), and if it weren't for the jet lag, we'd be ready and raring to go. But who left the heat on outside in Germany? Shut it off!&lt;/p&gt;

We've been making extensive use of the seal in printed and email correspondence, and had stickers printed for the restaurant in Dibbersen and all our company cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stickers are only 15 cm in diameter, and Frauke wanted something that would stand out for the press photo. We thought about an A4 laser printout, but then asked our printer for advice. Usually he find less expensive alternatives for us, but this time he suggested an upgrade. &quot;A4 is way too small! You want 50 cm diameter! On a board!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hamburger Abendblatt was impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher and I are spending the Ascension holiday weekend alone. Frauke and her brothers have taken their mother on a short trip to her mother's birthplace, organized for her 80th birthday. I wrote a bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/05/08/determination/&quot;&gt;about her for 75th birthday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was born in a village in what at the time as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margraviate_of_Brandenburg&quot;&gt;Mark Brandenburg&lt;/a&gt;, and now is western Poland. She was a miller's daughter, and the house and the mill pond still exist. I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/08/tel-aviv/&quot;&gt;her last visit 10 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, but this time she can show the place her children. They've been invited by the present residents for coffee this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an occasion for immediate family, so Christopher and I stayed behind. I'm sure we'll have a chance to see the place for ourselves sometime in the future. We're keeping ourselves well occupied... yesterday we saw the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tut-ausstellung.com/en/hamburg/the-great-tutanchamun-must-see-exhibition.html&quot;&gt;King Tut exhibit in Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; and experienced Avatar in 3D, and have further adventures planned for today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like many others, we to have a story of being disrupted by the closure of European airspace due to volcanic ash. Our story is however pretty boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were going to fly to Orlando for a week on business, but we couldn't fly so we stayed home instead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of attending the McDonald's Worldwide Convention (which occurs every two years, and will probably be in Orlando again), we have an unplanned free week. No plans, no meetings, no mail. Christopher is thrilled by the turn of events. He was supposed to stay with relatives this week, and can stay be home with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunday paper described the feeling of not flying as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.welt.de/die-welt/politik/article7229859/Poesie-des-Stillstands.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entschleunigung&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or deceleration), so we've adopted that as our key word for this week. We going to relax, not make plans, do some stuff around the house, but in all try not to accomplish anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, we didn't get off to a good start with &lt;em&gt;Entschleunigung&lt;/em&gt;. We got too much done today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Old School</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/04/15/old-school/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-15T19:38:50+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/04/15/old-school</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year I mentioned the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/02/10/school-daze/&quot;&gt;upcoming choice of a secondary school&lt;/a&gt; for our son after the fourth grade... well, now the fourth grade is nearly over, and the decision has been made. It was a choice that 3 months ago we hadn't even considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our state of Lower Saxony still splits into the 3 traditional secondary systems, for simplicity the upper, middle, and lower tracks. We've been told since 3rd grade that our son could expect a recommendation for the upper &lt;em&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/em&gt; track, and with the mid-term grades in February, that's what he got. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had resigned ourselves to choosing between two local public &lt;em&gt;Gymnasiums&lt;/em&gt;. We attended open houses at both, and most of our fears were confirmed. The events were loud and chaotic. The teachers sometimes didn't know their students' names. The class sizes are well over 30. The school day ends at 1 pm, with a full load of homework for the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we noticed a brochure for a private &lt;em&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/em&gt; near L√ºneburg. It had been recommended to us before, but we had forgotten about it. We went for a visit and were impressed. Day-long school with time to do homework at school. Individual attention from teachers. A motto of &quot;knowledge wants to be learned&quot;. Total school size 350 students. Class size maximum 24. No trace of elitism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are just two disadvantages. One is the cost, but we can deal with that. The other is the distance, over 45 km. However, interested parents in the next town have organized a bus service. Departure 7:30am, travel time 45 minutes, return at 4:30pm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our decision, and received the papers to sign today. A small step for the next 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For now I won't be naming the school here... it's time to start respecting our son's privacy. It can easily be googled from the details I've given.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Certified Family-Friendly Employer</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/04/11/certified-family-friendly-employer/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-11T11:56:19+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/04/11/certified-family-friendly-employer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fami-siegel.de/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/FaMi-Siegel.png&quot; alt=&quot;FaMi-Siegel.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We're very happy and proud that our restaurant in Dibbersen is a charter recipient of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fami-siegel.de/&quot;&gt;FaMi Seal&lt;/a&gt;, recognition of a family-friendly employer. We've already placed the seal prominently on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/&quot;&gt;our restaurant website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FaMi Seal is a new initiative in northeastern Lower Saxony by the DGB (German Federation of Trade Unions), the regional &lt;em&gt;Handelskammer&lt;/em&gt; (Chambers of Commerce) and &lt;em&gt;Arbeitgeberverband&lt;/em&gt; (employers' federation), the local Federaton of Women and Business, and the Leuphana University L√ºneburg. In other words, the regional establishment for business, labor and education. The process involved the submission of an 8 page application documenting our efforts and an 1/2-day visit from the jury to show that we practice what we preach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we practice? As a nearly 24/7 business, we can coordinate the work schedules of our employees with their families. Employees with children are given priority in vacation planning. We have encouraged and enabled employees with children to move into management positions. We are willing to find individual solutions for problems that may arise. As proof that the process works, we have 4 couples (including our senior manager and his wife) working for us who are all able to coordinate their work schedules with one another and their families (which makes work schedules during school vacations interesting, but it can be done). Since January we have an office manager (who I supervise) who sets her own schedule around school and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us, although the public recognition is nice, this is all part of being (and not just talking about being) a good employer. It also gives us a competitive advantage in the job market, which is becoming tighter all the time as the German population ages. We see the seal not just as a reward, but as a commitment to become even better in the future. Our business will depend on it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Anything But Sports</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/04/10/anything-but-sports/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-10T05:39:49+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/04/10/anything-but-sports</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At first it wasn't easy following baseball from Europe. I followed the 1991 World Series (the one where the Twins beat the Braves and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesportsdaddy.com/?p=798&quot;&gt;Kirby Puckett drove the bus&lt;/a&gt;) by reading box scores on CompuServe and catching glances a day later at the international edition USA Today on the newsstand at the Wandsbek Markt U-Bahn station. That worked until we flew to Mallorca. I caught the scores of Games 6 and 7 on Voice of America via shortwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days it's a lot easier thanks to satellite technology, hard disk recorders and the internets. I can satisfy my baseball cravings as a casual Twins fan by following news feeds from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/headlines.jsp?c_id=min&quot;&gt;official Twins site&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/blogs/&quot;&gt;StarTribune baseball writers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/min&quot;&gt;the Twins page at Yahoo! Sports&lt;/a&gt;, and blogger &lt;a href=&quot;http://aarongleeman.com/&quot;&gt;Aaron Gleeman&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron and I share the indignity of have been snubbed by the U of M student newspaper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mndaily.com/&quot;&gt;Minnesota Daily&lt;/a&gt;. Aaron now makes a living from a number of gigs including &lt;a href=&quot;http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/&quot;&gt;NBC Sports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rotoworld.com/content/features/column.aspx?sport=MLB&amp;amp;columnid=13&quot;&gt;Rotoworld&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the TV side there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://espnamerica.com&quot;&gt;ESPN America&lt;/a&gt; on German cable and satellite. For example, this week they are showing 12 baseball games live, including the Twins twice. Of course live in the US usually means wee hours of the morning here, so if you have a day job you need to record or wait for a rerun (with breaks cut out, so often better than live). The streams at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mlb.tv&quot;&gt;mlb.tv&lt;/a&gt; are better yet. For a price they offer all Major League games either live or on demand, even on an iPhone if you so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, my favorite site for general sports news is the German &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allesaussersport.de/&quot;&gt;allesaussersport&lt;/a&gt; by Hamburg blogger Kai Pahl. He's a fan of anything and everything, but particularly NFL football. He also knows more about soccer than I ever will, so I get tips on figuring out the Bundesliga (try to say &quot;Bruno Labbadia&quot; and &quot;master tactician&quot; in the same sentence while keeping a straight face). I haven't been able to get into the community at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allesaussersport.de/&quot;&gt;aas&lt;/a&gt;, though. The German commenters tend to be hard core fans of whatever sport, and as casual fan of the teams from my youth I guess I don't take sports seriously enough to fit in. I ain't here for business, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/Rosalita.html&quot;&gt;I'm only here for fun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/produktfinder.html#/veggieburger&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/McD_PM_20100216_Veggieburger_180x103.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;McD_PM_20100216_Veggieburger_180x103.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;103&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I'm a bit late on the uptake here, since it's been on the menu for over 2 weeks now, but the best &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/10/21/marketing-non-secrets/&quot;&gt;Marketing Non-Secret&lt;/a&gt; we heard about last October was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/produktfinder.html#/veggieburger&quot;&gt;Veggieburger&lt;/a&gt; which has now debuted in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of vegetarians in Germany, and several years ago McDonald's offered a larger vegetarian burger, the Gem√ºse-Mac, which had a small but loyal fan base. However, it just didn't sell well enough to fit into the production system. Either they were made to order, meaning you had to wait 6 minutes at a minimum, or the sandwiches were held well over the 10 minute holding limit, and you can imagine how that tasted (not good).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime McDonald's here has implemented a made-to-order system (BOP in McJargon) for deep-fried products, so we can now better offer a fresh but low-selling product. And the market for vegetarian sandwich is still there and growing, particularly among young women, and vegetarians cannot live on salads and french fries alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Veggieburger now headlines &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/12/marketing-non-secrets-3/&quot;&gt;the relaunched SMS line&lt;/a&gt;, along with the Cheeseburger and the Chickenburger. The deep-fried patty is based on potatoes, with carrots, red bell peppers, corn and onions, with a creamy sauce, lettuce and cheese. It's not a low-calorie sandwich. The calories per 100g (250) is the same as the Cheeseburger, but the Veggieburger is 20% heavier so has more total calories (360 vs. 300). It tastes alright, I think, although when I have 300 calories to spare on a snack I'd personally take a Cheeseburger. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As businesspeople we're happy with how the product is starting out. Sales are in the neighborhood of the Hamburger, and it's attracting a target group that wouldn't be so inclined to visit us. The price of 1.10¬Ä means we've broken the 1¬Ä barrier, and we can see how the guests react.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no TV spots yet for the Veggieburger, but it's pictured briefly in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGzdP41MKrw&quot;&gt;this cute spot&lt;/a&gt; for SMS. Even for non-German speakers, I think the dialog is clear (the father is going to McDonald's and asks if she wants anything). Don't think the spot would fly in the States, though... :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Headlines</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/02/15/headlines/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/02/15/headlines</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If even my mother says that my blog hasn't been updated for a while, it must be time to write something. Here are the headlines from the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* My birthday (48) came and went. Another year older and deeper in debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* We've had snow and ice in the Hamburg area for 7 weeks straight now, the longest anyone can remember. Even the newspapers are sick of it. The road departments have long run out of salt and sand, so the streets and sidewalks are horrible. We hear temperatures might get back above freezing at the end of the week.&lt;br /&gt;
* The cold weather means our restaurant sales are way below plan. We figure the snow has cost us 40K¬Ä in sales and counting, especially in Dibbersen which is only reachable by car. Our lobby furnace has needed constant attention, and just today the water pipes leading to the McCaf√© froze solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Christopher's midterm grades were good (solid Bs, or since they use numbers here, solid 2s). Since elementary school ends after the 4th grade in our state, we have to choose a secondary school for next year. He was recommended for the &lt;i&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/i&gt;, the academic track. There is no secondary school in Jesteburg, so we have several nearby schools to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, spring can start any time now!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Male Striptease...</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/02/03/male-striptease/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/02/03/male-striptease</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(That title should attract attention!) Or, A Different Kind of Dollar Menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/han-winsen.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/han-winsen-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-3710&quot; align=&quot;left&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We've been giggling about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/han-winsen.jpg&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; all day, but this was a nearby restaurant. If it were one of ours we wouldn't think it was so funny. I won't quote the brand or location to protect the innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick translation: &quot;Male strip tease starts fight in fast-food restaurant. According to police a fight broke out Monday evening with a 30-year-old injured with pepper spray. A young man had dropped his pants. At 11:35 several young men entered the restaurant. As a 20-year-old admitted he didn't have enough to pay for his order, the 27-year-old female cashier told him 'you can strip for it'. The young man pulled down his pants. The cashier's boyfriend (waiting for her in the lobby) did not find that funny at all, and attacked the young man. In the resulting tumult the 30-year-old was sprayed in the eye, and both sides filed assault charges with the police.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral: be careful with suggestive selling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/region/harburg/article1367223/Schlaegerei-im-Schnellrestaurant.html&quot;&gt;story is also at abendblatt.de&lt;/a&gt;, but you have to go through a paywall to be able to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Value Added Tax on Nothing</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/01/26/value-added-tax-on-nothing/"/>
   <updated>2010-01-26T15:51:43+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/01/26/value-added-tax-on-nothing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I asked this question on Twitter and got a lot of guesses, so I'll try it here for the blog crowd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February we're about to start another coffee cup giveaway with our McMen√ºs (Value Meals). Even though the cup is free, we have to adjust our Value Added Tax (similar to sales tax) programming in the registers. Why do you think we have to pay VAT on an item that is free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you don't get distracted... yes, Germany has different VAT rates for restaurant food eaten in or taken out. A porcelain cup is not food, so is taxed the same regardless. The answer has nothing to do with eat-in vs take-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The answer is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2010/01/26/value-added-tax-on-nothing/#comment-40677&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; in the comments, for everyone curious about German VAT regulations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to bring PapaScott into the new decade (if you believe decades begin in '0 years and not '1 years, that is). I was going to write about how this is the first new year in business that we weren't rushing around with new things, but I guess it's a bit late for that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got caught on the edge of the snow storm that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,671186,00.html&quot;&gt;hit northern Germany&lt;/a&gt; for the weekend, making things really bad on the Baltic coast (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-50586.html&quot;&gt;Spiegel Online has some pictures&lt;/a&gt;). Only about 10 inches of snow, but the wind made the roads no fun yesterday. School was cancelled in all counties near us, so Christopher gets a snow day today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German media doesn't know much about broadcasting weather warnings. Every podunk American local TV station has weather radar that shows the exact location of incoming storms. Here they can announce SHOCK HORROR DRAMA SNOW DISASTER is on the way, but can't say where, exactly. We got better storm information from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/regenradar/id293654490?mt=8&quot;&gt;free iPhone app&lt;/a&gt; than from the public TV networks we pay for.&lt;/p&gt;

Next step is to motorize!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas from Frauke, Scott and Christopher!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual I arranged for our Christmas cards for the US to be printed and mailed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cardstore.com/&quot;&gt;cardstore&lt;/a&gt;, saving time and postage. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/02/18/journalist-christopher/&quot;&gt;typewriter picture from last February&lt;/a&gt; is our favorite this year. Here's the printed message from inside... nothing new for our regular readers. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've now been in business 2-1/2 years, and having expanded from 1 restaurant to 3 this year on January 1, we've had plenty to do the past year. We have 130 employees, including 13 trainees starting a career with us through trade school or college programs. The business is still fun, exciting and satisfying. We were able take a few days off, spending 10 days in Minnesota in July and tacking on days off with Christopher after meetings in Munich and the Canary Islands (Spain). We're spending the holidays at home, inviting the Petersen family for roasted goose on the 27th. Christopher turns 10 this month and is in the 4th grade, his last year of German elementary school. His passion is LEGO and all things related to science. He also goes inline skating and has just joined the local youth volunteer fire department. When he's in the mood, he helps out in the restaurants as cashier back-up or drive-thru runner. In the house we're currently renoving the basment into a proper office and guest room. No travel plans yet for 2010, other than a meeting in Orlando in April. We might actually properly celebrate our belated silver wedding anniversary this summer. This summer also marks the 20th year that we've been in Germany. Hard to believe in 1990 we wanted to stay 3, maybe 5 years. Now we have a franchise contract until at least 2028, unless Christopher decides to buy us out sooner!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Bad Translation</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been in Germany too long to be really shocked by anything anymore, but last night I had to let my jaw drop. Christopher was watching the Disney-owned TV channel SuperRTL, which was showing a Christmas special from the cartoon &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recess_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;&quot;Recess&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. According to the German dub, this boy was dressed as a &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; (screenshot from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQGJbGeccl8&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/recess_xmas.png&quot; alt=&quot;TJ dressed as a menorah&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming the cause was ignorance rather than anti-Semitism, since I'm sure TV shows are translated quickly rather than carefully. But then again, you never know...&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What a Long Strange Trip It's Been</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/12/05/what-a-long-strange-trip-its-been</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/6346696650&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; yesterday from Dave Winer reminded me that online blogging service &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/1999/12/04.html&quot;&gt;editthispage.com&lt;/a&gt; opened to the public on that date in 1999, 10 years ago, thanks to Dave and his company at the time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Userland Software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means that today, a day later (due to the time difference between California and Germany), www.papascott.de is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/05/it-worked/&quot;&gt;10 years old&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of other blogs got started with edithispage.com as well. A few of the names from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20000816190255/www.editthispage.com/Top100&quot;&gt;Most Visited Sites&lt;/a&gt; from August 2000 are still around. I have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user%2F15603694783728674282%2Flabel%2Fetp-vets&quot;&gt;etp-vets folder&lt;/a&gt; at Google Reader to keep up with them after all this time. I've had the joy of meeting a few of these writers in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, I'm cleaning up the archive from that first month, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/&quot;&gt;December 1999&lt;/a&gt;. It was a very important month for us, preparing for Christmas and new arrivals. Our Christmas got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/26/2nd-christmas-day/&quot;&gt;cut short&lt;/a&gt; (posted while we were running out the door!), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/27/christopher-ryan-hanson/&quot;&gt;our lives were changed forever&lt;/a&gt;. (These days short posts like that would probably be twittered. Will our tweets still be available 10 years from now?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't expect too much from the old articles... the editthispage.com site is long gone, so most of the links are dead. The macros (items in quote marks automatically replaced by images and such) don't work except where I've replaced them by hand. Here's my favorite macro from back then: &quot;curly&quot;. Click on him and he talks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/curly1.wav&quot; title=&quot;I'm trying to think but nothing happens!&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/curly.gif&quot; alt=&quot;curly.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;53&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gr√ºnkohl Turkey Day</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/26/grunkohl-turkey-day/"/>
   <updated>2009-11-26T16:27:21+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/26/grunkohl-turkey-day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've never gotten in the habit of celebrating American Thanksgiving here in Germany, but as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/papascott/status/6079791888&quot;&gt;mentioned on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; today, by coincidence we are going out for a traditional meal this Thanksgiving evening. The local &lt;em&gt;Wirtschaftsrunde&lt;/em&gt; (chamber of commerce, sort of) is holding their annual &lt;em&gt;Gr&amp;uuml;nkohl&lt;/em&gt; dinner. I've never had it, and I suspect that Frauke is taking me along to the dinner not just to keep her company, but so that we can split one portion and she only has to eat half as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Internets, &lt;em&gt;Gr&amp;uuml;nkohl&lt;/em&gt; translates as &quot;curly kale&quot; and is a north German dish often served with &lt;em&gt;Pinkel&lt;/em&gt; (small sausages) (no, not &lt;a href=&quot;http://dict.leo.org/?search=pinkeln&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;pinkeln&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that's something else). Judging from this &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr&amp;uuml;nkohl#Eigenschaften&quot;&gt;picture from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the vegetable content of the meal is actually quite small...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Gruenkohlgericht.jpg&amp;amp;filetimestamp=20060801154439&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Gruenkohlgericht.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gruenkohlgericht.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish us luck, or at least &lt;em&gt;Guten Appetit!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update after the fact:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;em&gt;Gr√ºnkohl&lt;/em&gt; was in fact very tasty! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/26/grunkohl-turkey-day/#comment-40308&quot;&gt;Details in the comments below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since we're being nostalgic this month, with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/09/as-the-wall-fell/&quot;&gt;fall of the Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt; and all that, how about we go even further back, to November 1979. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis&quot;&gt;Iran hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt; had just begun on November 4, but I can't recall any of the other events. A month later, the Who Concert tragedy and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, I can recall them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Saturday, November 17, 1979  something occurred in Montevideo, Minnesota, that changed my life. I was 17, and at a Lutheran Church youth meeting I first laid my eyes on a 16-year-old AFS exchange student from West Germany who would later become my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn't recognize it as a life-changing event at the time. I only noticed her because we were both wearing AFS sweatshirts. That summer I had been an exchange student with AFS myself to Brazil. I remember talking to her, and thinking she was nice. It wasn't until we met a second time a couple of months later I realized that this girl was something special. That second meeting I associate with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_Ice&quot;&gt;Miracle on Ice&lt;/a&gt;, but according to the calendar that must have been a two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her town was 25 miles from mine, and she had no driver's license, so it wasn't so easy to keep in touch.  The high school winter sports season was in full spring, and we managed to &quot;accidentally&quot; meet at various basketball and wrestling tournaments. The teams from my town were unusually successful that year, and her town had the largest gym to host the tournament games. Once the sports seasons were over, we had to go on our first real date, the James Bond movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonraker_(film)&quot;&gt;Moonraker&lt;/a&gt; with Roger Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as it is with high school students, I took her to my senior prom, and she invited me to her senior prom. But I never made it... I crashed my parents' car into a bridge siding on my way to meet her. She found a replacement date that same evening, but only just for that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer she returned to Germany, and we thought our relationship would end. But we kept in touch, via the best means possible at the time, air mail. She continued her Abitur, I started college, and that winter we simultaneously came to the conclusion that our relationship was something worth continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, the rest is not history, because it continues to this very day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Marketing Non-Secrets 3</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/12/marketing-non-secrets-3/"/>
   <updated>2009-11-12T17:52:35+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/12/marketing-non-secrets-3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/10/21/marketing-non-secrets/&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; that as the marketing initiatives we learned about at our franchisee meeting in October were released, I'd mention them here. Has anyone noticed the new initiative, or more correctly, the old initiative that was rebranded this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/schnell_mal_sparen.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/sms.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sms.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;82&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Back to my letter codes: S is for &quot;SMS&quot;. The value menu segment (the German equivalent of the US &lt;a href=&quot;http://cep.mcdonalds.com/dollar/&quot;&gt;Dollar Menu&lt;/a&gt;) has been renamed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/schnell_mal_sparen.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Schnell Mal Sparen&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (which is hard to translate, maybe &quot;quickly save now&quot;). The products and the prices are the same as before, and the new logo is very similar to the old one. I'm sure that most customers haven't even noticed the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the difference exactly? Other than that &quot;SMS&quot; is recognized by the world as a quick and easy form of communication? After all, the old name was very well recognized, why change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old name had a fatal flaw. It included the number &quot;one&quot; (twice even), and implied that the prices of the value items would always and forever be exactly 1.00&amp;euro;. The SMS name no longer promises a price, and is thus flexible to include items that do not cost exactly 1.00&amp;euro;. If things go as planned, we'll be adding an item or two that cost a bit more than 1.00&amp;euro; to the SMS menu in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we going to raise the price of the existing SMS items? No, that would be stupid in the middle of a worldwide economic crisis that's just now hitting Germany with full effect. But we're using the economic climate to rebrand the value menu now to have the flexibility to adjust the menu in the future. That's a luxury we have as a brand that is growing while the total QSR market (and thus our competitors) are shrinking. We'll be able to use SMS as a marketing vehicle for years to come, irregardless of increasing costs or inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>As The Wall Fell</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/09/as-the-wall-fell/"/>
   <updated>2009-11-09T03:49:09+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/09/as-the-wall-fell</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's strange that as the one world event that directly changed our lives, I don't remember where I was when the Berlin Wall fell or even exactly how I heard about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 1989 we were in Chandler, Arizona, over 5000 miles from Berlin. We had moved to Arizona in May, and we didn't yet have permanent jobs. At first we had both helped out managing a McDonald's restaurant in the desert, but we were sure our future would be in the Valley of the Sun. Frauke was at a restaurant in South Phoenix, I was working for a temp agency. We had picked a bad time to move to Arizona, though. The Savings and Loan crisis had broken out, and the economy was flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona is 8 hours behind Germany, so evening in Berlin was early afternoon for us. We hadn't been following the events in East Germany that closely... we knew about the Monday Demonstrations, the refugees escaping through Hungary and Czechoslovakia and that there had been a large demonstration in East Berlin, but had no idea how close the regime was to collapse. Frauke got a call to turn on CNN from her friend Gabi, who herself had escaped from Hungary. I vaguely remember hearing the news in my car... it had to have been on the radio, on NPR, since it was still the BCP age (Before Cell Phones). I don't remember watching on television or thinking that the world from now on would be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed for us personally over the following weeks is that Germany became &lt;i&gt;interesting&lt;/i&gt;. Germany and Europe would be changing for the better, and we could imagine spending a part of our future there, especially since the stalled economy in Arizona meant we weren't getting ahead where we were. It was in fact the franchisee in South Phoenix that suggested Frauke think about Germany, and he had the contacts within McDonald's get her application started. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By summer it was clear that the door was open if we wanted to make the move, and that it was time to make a decision. We were following that year's World Cup in Italy, and jokingly said that if Germany would win, we would move. The final was on July 8, Germany did win, and 6 weeks later we had sold or given away most of our possessions, packed a half-container with the rest, drove to Minnesota to say good-bye to my parents, loaded up 4 suitcases and 3 cats on a plane, and were on our way to Hamburg (first to Kiel, where we had a temporary apartment). Germany was not yet unified; reunification and the first elections took place that fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up in Hamburg pretty much by chance. We figured we'd eventually end up in Berlin, but McDonald's didn't have an office there yet. They did have offices in Munich, Frankfurt, D&amp;uuml;sseldorf and Hamburg, and applied to Hamburg as it was the closest to where Frauke grew up. It turned out we'd never leave.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Don't Be So Damned Sure!</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/02/dont-be-so-damned-sure/"/>
   <updated>2009-11-01T23:23:37+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/02/dont-be-so-damned-sure</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The best lesson for surviving as an expat I learned my first quarter... in fact, my first weeks at the University of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lesson came early in the &quot;Introduction to Theater&quot; course taught by the legendary Arthur Ballet. My best friend Beth from high school was going to major in Theater, and even though I planned to major in International Relations, I had to take some Liberal Arts classes, so we took the class together. It was one of the most popular courses on campus, even though Prof. Ballet's health was poor and we often saw his lectures on video tape rather than live and in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a history of theater, we started with ancient Greece, and one of Prof. Ballet's favorite plays was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/oedipus/summary.html&quot;&gt;Oedipus The King&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which he summed up in a single phrase: &quot;Don't be so damned sure!&quot; Don't ever assume that you're right, about anything! Anytime! Oedipus thought he was king of the world, but in fact he killed his father and married his mother. (In fact, even 30 years after I took the course, you can still find a Google result for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?rls=en&amp;amp;q=%22don't+be+so+damned+sure%22+arthur+ballet&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Arthur Ballet &quot;don't be so damned sure&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an expat, this means you have to be ready for anything. Anything, and everything, can be different than what you expect. In fact, you have to question what you expect. A trivial example: do you want to bake &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verybestbaking.com/recipes/detail.aspx?id=18476&quot;&gt;chocolate chip cookies&lt;/a&gt; in Germany? I'm sorry, you won't find chocolate chips in the grocery stores here. Or baking soda. Or brown sugar. Or even vanilla extract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if baking is not your thing, the concept remains... you have to be ready for anything and eveything to be different. And after a while, you'll notice that most of the differences are superficial, and the most important things that humans have in common are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To venture back to theater, another question raised by Professor Ballet is one he never answered in his introductory class. He mentioned a line that was the most profound in the history of theater, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duchess_of_Malfi&quot;&gt;&quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, as the Duchess is killed by her brother, he says &amp;ldquo;Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died young.&amp;rdquo; One night, on our way home after heavy drinking, Beth and I had the answer... we looked at each other and knew we had the meaning that Prof. Ballet had hinted at. But the next morning, it was gone. And today, if we were to meet and one of us would start to say &quot;Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle...&quot;, we would both remember we once had the answer, but it is now gone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Marketing Non-Secrets 2</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/10/22/marketing-non-secrets-2/"/>
   <updated>2009-10-22T21:21:27+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/10/22/marketing-non-secrets-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following up on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/10/21/marketing-non-secrets/&quot;&gt;marketing post from yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, I can cover the next two points rather quickly, since they are both in the current TV campaign for &quot;Los Wochos&quot;. You only need to watch one spot, and only pay attention to the last 5 seconds to get both points. In fact, the first point requires only a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point FP is &quot;Food Photography&quot;. The past year or so our spots have featured &quot;exploding food&quot;, with action shots of the inside of a sandwich, fries flying into the package, and drinks slopping over the cup. The new trend, currently mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_photography&quot;&gt;food photography entry at Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, is a natural look. Instead of a perfect glossed burger, the photo is more realistic, an unevenly focussed close-up from above of an unperfectly dressed burger with crumbs and lettuce lying about. Frauke and I call it the &quot;crooked burger&quot; look, and it's already in the current TV spot, and more photos in this style may be coming to in-store POP this winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/fp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point SC is &quot;Secondary Claim&quot;. The primary claim for McDonald's is of course &quot;I'm lovin' it!&quot;, or in German, &quot;Ich liebe es!&quot; Last year we heard Global CMO &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company/bios/mary_dillon.html&quot;&gt;Mary Dillon&lt;/a&gt; explain that the unspoken promise made by the McDonald's brand is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdstyleguide.eu/register/select-section/&amp;ldquo;simple-easy-enjoyment&amp;rdquo;.aspx&quot;&gt;&quot;simple easy enjoyment&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/frNEEFGhpak&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;border=1&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/frNEEFGhpak&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;border=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/embed&amp;gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current spot ends by vocalizing this promise: &quot;Einfach geniessen&quot; (or &quot;simply enjoy&quot;), and the phrase occurs in the radio spots as well. We were told to expect to hear (and see) more of &quot;Einfach geniessen&quot; as a unifying theme for the brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all the points I can reveal for now... number 4 will have to wait until next month. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Marketing Non-Secrets</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/10/21/marketing-non-secrets/"/>
   <updated>2009-10-21T06:02:29+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/10/21/marketing-non-secrets</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week we were at the annual fall franchisee meeting in Tenerife, where we had to endure sunny skies and 30&amp;deg;C while those at home had a week of clouds and rain. We don't choose where to go for these meetings, we just go where McDonald's tells us to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One highlight of these meetings is the marketing presentation, where the marketing department tells us how they intend to spend our money for the following year. Coming from marketing people, the presentation is of course very well done. This year, however, the content was also impressive. There were a number of simple, clear points where our immediate reaction was to nod and say yes, that's a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not talking about specific campaigns here. As to whether we will be doing a Monopoly game, a World Cup promotion in June, or a Coke Glass giveaway next summer, you can probably guess the answers yourself. And for you Web 2.0 aficionados, I must disappoint you. There was no mention of social media at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some of my readers have a professional interest in marketing, so without giving away any secrets, I can mention the points that impressed us as they are implemented and made public. (To jog my memory in the coming months, my list of points is H, FP, SC, S, V, PP, S4, and TC.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point H is &quot;Happy&quot; (or &quot;Mr. Happy&quot;), the new European &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happymeal.de/&quot;&gt;Happy Meal campaign&lt;/a&gt; featuring animated Happy Meal boxes that started here in September. As adults, the spots make no sense to us at all, but Christopher rolls over laughing every time he sees one, so they must work. They are certainly colorful and loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/1XJAHI7FOY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;border=1&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/1XJAHI7FOY8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;border=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; /&gt;&amp;lt;/embed&amp;gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a bit of Googling, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://lineboil.com/2009/09/mcdonalds-infectious-happy-meal-campaign/&quot;&gt;found out at Lineboil&lt;/a&gt; that the campaign was developed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tbwa-france.com/&quot;&gt;TBWA\FRANCE&lt;/a&gt;, and the spots are directed by by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.passion-pictures.com/flash.html#page=d9&quot;&gt;Laurent Nicolas at Passion Pictures Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Spot checking websites for the major McDonald's countries in Europe, I found versions of Happy in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happymeal.fr/&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.es/&quot;&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.it/#/op-special-mr-happy2/&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.ru/?ver=flash&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.happymeal.pl/&quot;&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Barely, Slightly...</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/09/29/barely-slightly/"/>
   <updated>2009-09-29T20:06:29+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/09/29/barely-slightly</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been two days since the German Bundestag election, which a center-right coalition of Union and FDP was able to win, and I haven't yet thought of anything to say. I've been waiting for &lt;a href=&quot;http://claireseuroamerica.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;someone more intelligent than I&lt;/a&gt; to comment, but since she hasn't posted yet, I'll have to wing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best news is that the worst result was avoided, namely the continuation of the do-nothing grand coalition of Union and SPD with both parties shackled to one another. Whether or not one agrees with the direction, at least the new government will have a direction, which the grand coalition (by definition) did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new center-right coalition is also stable, in that it does not depend on so-called &quot;overhang&quot; seats (which have been declared unconstitutional, but only in 2011) nor on the whims of the junior partner (a weakened SPD might have been tempted to later dump the Union in favor the Greens and the Left party).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both main parties lost ground, but the SPD lost big time, with over 38% fewer votes than in 2005. The minor parties all had record results, in particular the ex-communist Left party was able to gain at the expense of the SPD. The SPD will now have time to sort out its defeat and how to mend fences with the Left, if it doesn't want to see politics dominated by the Union for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for us, we're not disappointed to see a more pro-business slant for the next few years, although I would have wished for some Green influence against nuclear power. Change comes slowly in Germany, so new directions come only barely and slightly, but better than no direction at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth mentioning the Pirate Party, which on a platform of internet freedom and data privacy won 2% of the vote (falling well short of the 5% threshold to enter the Bundestag). I personally find the Pirate Party to be a waste of time and effort. The issues they raise are important, in fact too important to relegate to a splinter party. They should be lobbying today's politicians instead of starting a new party that may or (most likely) may not have influence in 5 years time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Easy Morning for Free goes Nationwide</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/09/20/easy-morning-for-free-goes-nationwide/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/09/20/easy-morning-for-free-goes-nationwide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we did our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/10/11/easy-morning-for-free/&quot;&gt;Easy Morning for Free&lt;/a&gt; promotion in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/&quot;&gt;our restaurant in Dibbersen&lt;/a&gt; last year, we received a lot of positive response from within McDonald's wondering whether the idea could work on a larger scale. A similar promotion was done this spring when the new breakfast menu was introduced in Munich and Stuttgart. But wouldn't it be better yet if McDonald's could invite all of Germany to a free breakfast?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Sunday, election day in Germany, that dream will come true. Next Saturday's &lt;em&gt;Bild Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; and Sunday's &lt;em&gt;Bild am Sonntag&lt;/em&gt; will carry coupons for a free breakfast (1 per person) at all participating McDonald's in Germany from 9 to 11 on Sunday. If you'd rather not buy a paper, the coupons will be available online as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/produkte/easy_morning.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wahlsonntag_karte1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wahlsonntag_karte1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;631&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political choices may be pretty weak this year, however the McDonald's ballot offers a much wider variety of choices than the political ballot, No first and second votes, though, only one coupon per customer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>And the crowd goes "Yeaahh!"</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It all started with with a poster for an Angela Merkel rally in Hamburg...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Chancellor is coming&quot;, and someone scribbled &quot;and the crowd goes 'Yeaahh!'&quot; (or something to that effect). Someone else snapped a picture and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/spanier/3910411907/&quot;&gt;posted it to the internets&lt;/a&gt; last week. A lot of people thought it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spreeblick.com/2009/09/15/und-alle-so-yeaahh/&quot;&gt;cool&lt;/a&gt;, and wouldn't it be cooler yet if the crowd would really go &quot;Yeaahh!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this evening there were about 500 people gathered at the rally who went &quot;Yeaahh&quot; at Merkel's every word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I wasn't there. I have a wife and son, I don't have time for nonsense like this. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the city festival in Buchholz, the city power utility had a rolling carpet on which one could &quot;surf&quot;. Christopher of course had to try it out. He only wiped out twice, but no rug burns. Here are a couple of iPhone snapshots...&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Exit Now!</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/09/12/exit-now</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It took a bit longer than we hoped, but to make sure you find our restaurant on the Winsener Stra&amp;szlig;e in Hamburg-Harburg we've complemented &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/06/27/interesting-drive/&quot;&gt;our sign on the A7 southbound&lt;/a&gt; before the Fleestedt exit with one for the A7 northbound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/A-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A 7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell from the closeup, but the sign is 12 meters wide and nearly 3 meters high. Here's a wider view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/A-7-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A 7-1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sign has to be large to make up for a sub-optimal location 1) on the left side of the Autobahn and 2) right before the exit. Like the sign says, you have to exit &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Inner Peace</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/&quot;&gt;After 8 years&lt;/a&gt;, I think I've found peace. Inner peace, anyway. Outer peace is so hard to find these days. Just ask anyone in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what has changed in that time? Not much. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_cell#Background&quot;&gt;Marienstrasse&lt;/a&gt; is still in Hamburg, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Quds_Mosque&quot;&gt;Al-Quds mosque&lt;/a&gt; too. We've sent soldiers abroad, more soldiers in Iraq have fallen than those who fell that day into thin air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer as we were in New York, we took the subway to Ground Zero, to catch a glimpse of hallowed ground. It was a tourist spot, with hawkers and food stands, but inside the fences, even on Saturday, the site was &lt;em&gt;alive&lt;/em&gt; with construction work. That comforted me somehow, and we moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what has changed? Nothing but the passage of time. Time closes all wounds, but are do the wounds really heal? All wounds leave a scar. I wish I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/10/five-years/&quot;&gt;forget that day&lt;/a&gt;, but time moves on and the scars remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Gotta Feeling</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/09/10/i-gotta-feeling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;... that tonight's going to be a good night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew to Munich last weekend for the 5th (my 2nd) annual Whiney Expat Meetup, and it was indeed 2 good good nights, and the days were good as well. It was just the right mix of organization and spontaneity, and having all gotten acquainted online, we could skip the introductions and get right to the good part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munich is a nice city to visit, a good backdrop for fun and conversation for about 20 assorted expats and tag-along Germans. I didn't see anything I hadn't seen before, execpt for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.villastuck.de/&quot;&gt;Villa Stuck&lt;/a&gt; (the interior reminded me of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bossard.de/&quot;&gt;Kunstst&amp;auml;tte Bossard&lt;/a&gt; near us) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisbach&quot;&gt;Eisbach surfers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my fellow expats prefer to remain anonymous (I have enough trouble keeping up with real names, so matching up fake names and blog names is a bit too much), so I'll just point to the public Flickr groups &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/webum/&quot;&gt;WEBUM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/webum2009/&quot;&gt;WEBUM2009&lt;/a&gt; and the online accounts at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zurika.com/2009/09/munich-so-many-bloggers.html&quot;&gt;zurika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amiexpat.com/2009/09/06/weekly-winners-webum-in-munich-6-sep-2009/&quot;&gt;amiexpat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://noapathyallowed.com/2009/09/08/munich-webmu-2009/&quot;&gt;noapathyallowed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regensblog.com/2009/09/06/webum-2009-munich/&quot;&gt;regensblog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://snookspot.blogspot.com/2009/09/random-tuesday-to-infinity-and-beyond.html&quot;&gt;snooker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elmada.com/?p=6373&quot;&gt;elmada&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elmada.com/?p=6376&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elmada.com/?p=6385&quot;&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; even), not to mention several others whom I've missed or who haven't yet chosen to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a long and drawn-out process (hosted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatbloggersingermany.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) of choosing a date and place for the meetup somewhat similar to choosing a US presidential candidate, but early polls indicate 2010 will probably be in the early fall again in a somewhat northern city, say Berlin or Hamburg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we'll do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Health Insurance and Welcome to It</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/08/14/my-health-insurance-and-welcome-to-it/"/>
   <updated>2009-08-14T21:18:25+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/08/14/my-health-insurance-and-welcome-to-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the current debate on health insurance in the United States, some of my readers might be interested in my health coverage here in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most employees are required to join the public insurance system. It's financed something like Social Security, with a percentage (currently 14.9%) of income  up to a certain limit (currently 3675¬Ä per month) split between employer and employee.  The system covers children and students through their parents, as well as the unemployed and pensioners. Insured patients do not see any bills, but fixed co-payments for prescriptions, office visits per quarter, dental, and optical. There is not a single insurer, but nearly 200 different &quot;sickness funds&quot; with similar coverage and rates. Lost wages due to sickness are covered (actually, the employer pays the first 6 weeks, the insurer thereafter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-income employees and the self-employed can opt out of the public system and purchase private insurance. Private insurance might be cheaper than public insurance (since premiums don't rise with your income) or might not (children cost extra, premiums depend on your age). However the coverage is better and generally there is a set deductable rather than co-payments. And as an employee, the employer covers half the premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a free-lancer, I was able to opt out of the public system in my early 30s and lock in good rates. Through a loophole in the system (involving extended part-time work), I'm now permanently opted out, regardless of my salary. My monthly cost for medical and dental is &amp;euro;135 with a &amp;euro;500 yearly deductable. That covers virtually anything, including lost wages. Even expenses when visiting the US are covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our disadvantages as private patients? Women pay more (pregnancy risk). We have to pay for Christopher. And our premiums may go up with time (with increases in inflation and life expectancy). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German health system is not perfect. The systems in France and Switzerland might be better. There are fairness issues... private insurance compensate better than the public system, so doctors favor private patients. Administrative costs for the sickness funds are high, and there is fraud. Drug costs are high, doctors are poorly compensated, and there are too many hospital beds. The system undergoes constant tinkering... but the system, which dates to the 19th century, still works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an employer, the multitude of sickness funds, covering sick pay for the first 6 weeks, and keeping track of various classes of employees with and without insurance is a bureaucratic nightmare. But we outsource to a payroll accountant that deals with all that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest benefit of the health system is peace of mind. I simply do not have to worry financially about getting sick. I still may worry about pain and needles and hospital food, but I don't need to worry about paying the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 17 Aug 2009&lt;/strong&gt; Added current rates to 2nd paragraph (14.9% of income up to 3675¬Ä per month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry, but when I saw these two posters yesterday, I knew they just were begging to be combined in a single post. The poster on the right has managed to hit a taboo-trifecta (race, nudity, homosexualtiy) with maybe even more taboos I haven't noticed (bad nail polish?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two great tastes that go great... no, I won't finish that thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Left: Berlin CDU Bundestag candidate Vera Lengsfeld, &quot;We have more to offer&quot;, seen at &lt;a href=&quot;http://50percentdna.blogspot.com/2009/08/merkel.html&quot;&gt;50% of my DNA&lt;/a&gt;. Right: Local Green poster in Kaarst, NRW, &quot;The only reason to vote black&quot;, seen at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amiexpat.com/2009/08/11/racist-tasteless-or-provocative/&quot;&gt;AmiExpat&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The background color is SPD red&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The back of the poster is stamped with &quot;SPD Harburg&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the posters have something to do with the SPD. The local paper explained the mystery that the posters will be updated twice before the election with more letters to form a complete sentence. I would think, though, with the bad polls the SPD has been getting, they'd be better off getting their complete message out now rather than waiting until later. By then it might be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we have this. I take it the graphic artist is a plant from the opposing party and deliberately sabotaged this poster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3808362052&quot; title=&quot;View 'IMG_0235' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2545/3808362052_d00fcc3a63.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0235&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is the &quot;... na&quot; from the first poster. That mystery is now solved! But what is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monika-griefahn.de/&quot;&gt;the candidate's last name&lt;/a&gt; again, in case we wanted to vote for her?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why PapaScott?</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/08/08/why-papascott/"/>
   <updated>2009-08-08T16:12:20+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/08/08/why-papascott</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why PapaScott?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oldest remaining shards of what would be become PapaScott date back 10 years to &lt;a href=&quot;/blogger99.html&quot;&gt;August 1999&lt;/a&gt; and were posted with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, a shiny new technology at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1999 we were pregnant with Christopher, and we were calling each other cute names like MamaMaus and PapaScott. And when I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/05/it-worked/&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; a site on the brand spaning new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1999/12/08/editthispagecom.html&quot;&gt;edithispage.com&lt;/a&gt;, it didn't take long for me to start calling it PapaScott, even after Christopher was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/27/christopher-ryan-hanson/&quot;&gt;born&lt;/a&gt; later that month. The name fits, even today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why PapaScott? Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nine Azubis</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/08/03/nine-azubis/"/>
   <updated>2009-08-03T07:57:46+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/08/03/nine-azubis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two years ago on the first of July we officially &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/07/01/first-day-of-work/&quot;&gt;began our business adventure&lt;/a&gt;. However, it's more appropriate to look back on our two years of business experience a month later, the first workday in August. Today is the beginning of the new trade school term, and today four new &lt;em&gt;Azubis&lt;/em&gt; are beginning their education and their career with us, joining the five &lt;em&gt;Azubis&lt;/em&gt; we already have for a total of nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Azubi&lt;/em&gt; spelled out in full is &lt;em&gt;Auszubildender&lt;/em&gt;, and translates roughly as apprentice or trainee. They are trade school students who have finished at least the 10th grade, and work with us half-time while learning the official trade  &lt;em&gt;Fachmann/Fachfrau f&amp;uuml;r Systemgastronomie&lt;/em&gt; (Professional for Quick Service Restaurants). It's a 2-1/2 year program that encompasses all business aspects of the restaurant. Upon completion the Azubi is a fully-qualified Shift Leader and is on-track to advance into restaurant management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with 1 Azubi in 2007 when we started our business in Dibbersen (she is now a Shift Leader for us). We hired 2 new Azubis in 2008. Through acquiring the two restaurants in Harburg, we hired 3 more. And today 4 new &lt;em&gt;Azubis&lt;/em&gt; are starting with us. We are hoping for a fifth, and if successful we can have a round number of 10 &lt;em&gt;Azubis&lt;/em&gt; for our third year in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may not all succeed. &lt;em&gt;Azubis&lt;/em&gt; are young people with little or no work experience, and they may find that night and weekend shifts and sometimes hectic work days are not what they expected for their career. Those who do succeed, though, are the future of our business. The young people we train now will be running our restaurants in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of our third trade school year is the perfect day to celebrate our third year in business, and the growth of our &lt;em&gt;Azubi&lt;/em&gt; team from one to nine (maybe ten) in two years is the perfect sign of our growth and expectations for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Liberty's Crown</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/07/24/libertys-crown/"/>
   <updated>2009-07-24T10:58:16+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/07/24/libertys-crown</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On our way home from Minnesota, we stopped for two nights in New York. That was my first time there, excepting a trip when I was 20 and took a Greyhound bus for 2 days from Minneapolis. That's not an experience I care to remember or repeat. As first timers for a weekend, we hit the standard tourist spots... Times Square, Empire State Building, and (especially for Christopher) the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amnh.org/&quot;&gt;American Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were however lucky enough to get Crown Tickets for the Statue of Liberty. The Crown was just re-opened to visitors on July 4th, and we were there a week later on July 11th. We were able to order tickets online the first day they went on sale. We were lucky. Only 30 people are allowed in the crown each hour. Right now, Crown Tickets are sold out through October and no Saturdays are available until December 5. Crown access costs $3 in addition to normal admission and ferry fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hitch is that the crown is only accessible by staircase, with 354 steps. The staircase spirals and is a bit tight at the end. Children must be at least 4 feet tall and able to climb the stairs by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tickets can't be printed out online, you need to pick them up at the will call window. We were worried about long lines, so we arrived at noon, 2 hours ahead of our scheduled time. That was way too early... there was no line at will call, and the waiting time for reserve tickets was just 15 minutes (those without reserve tickets were waiting 90 minutes). We hung out for an hour in Battery Park, enjoying a microbrew from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mypicnick.com/&quot;&gt;Picnick kiosk&lt;/a&gt; while Christopher explored the musical sculptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then joined the horde for the ferries, which were much like the Hadag commuter ferries in Hamburg harbor except for the airport-style security screening. Once on Liberty Island, we separated from the horde to head to the info booth to show our official ID and pick up wrist bands and instructions for the crown. The instructions were basically &quot;ask the rangers along the way where to go next&quot;. No bags or backpacks are allowed, so we had to lock those up. There's another security screening (this time with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffer_Machine&quot;&gt;puffer machine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We entered the monument and were told to go straight on up the stairs. I lost count at 200, but the climb was easier than I imagined. There were a couple of rangers posted along the way to offer encouragement, but suddenly, there we were. Two rangers were at the top, and together with them for several minutes were alone on top of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3752458049&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG1447' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2594/3752458049_26719d2cfe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG1447&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could feel the statue swaying slightly in the wind, and could see the torch moving back and forth. The day was relatively cool, so it was comfortable inside. Christopher asked the rangers about going into the torch... they told him it's been closed since 1916, when German saboteurs blew up a weapons depot on the Jersey side, and the shock waves slightly tilted the torch arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, if you can plan enough ahead to get the tickets, the climb to the crown is well worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

One, because of his dual citizenship, he can vote twice as often as either of his parents. Secondly, if he were to run for German Chancellor*, he would campaign for the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More help for victims of natural disaster, and research to prevent such disasters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy conservation, less oil and coal, more wind and solar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abolish war&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a solid platform, but the devil is going to be in the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Yes, we realize he previously &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/11/05/yes-we-can-in-2036/&quot;&gt;announced his candidacy for the US Presidency&lt;/a&gt;. We'll issue a statement when we know which is correct.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/06/08/pesky-parliament</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm often annoyed by the politics at Rainy Day, by an Irish expat in Munich, but he produces enough gems for me to keep him in my feed reader. For instance, today on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eamonn.com/2009/06/back_in_2014.htm&quot;&gt;42% turnout for this year's European elections&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that holding direct elections to the European Parliament would somehow create a common European identity has been exposed as nonsense. The good people of Estonia don't know or care about the factors that determined the voting of their fellow EU citizens in Austria, Slovenia, Malta and Luxembourg. And vice versa. There is no European election is the sense that the press keeps on about. The separate national elections within Europe are sold by a compliant media as being somehow pan-European.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct elections were meant to create the notion of democracy within the European Union, but real power in Brussels remains with institutions that are not accountable to anybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that the institutions are in the end accountable to the heads of state of the member countries, i.e. Merkel, Sarkozy and Co., who are much happier with the present arrangement of back-room control than they would be with a pesky democratic parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, our village is protected by an attack buzzard! A couple of years ago  2 cyclists were indeed attacked by a buzzard that was nesting nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I have no idea how I would defend myself if I were actually attacked by the buzzard? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0K_LZDXp0I&quot;&gt;Duck and cover?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hybrid Fryer</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/05/27/hybrid-fryer/"/>
   <updated>2009-05-27T17:15:37+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/05/27/hybrid-fryer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just to show that we not only make &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/04/15/stripes-from-paris&quot;&gt;sexy investments with French models&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused with promotions with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendzeitung.de/leute/108462&quot;&gt;German top models&lt;/a&gt;), this morning at our restaurant in Dibbersen we installed the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/04/15/stripes-from-paris&quot;&gt;low-oil-volume (LOV) fryer&lt;/a&gt; that we've been planning for over a year, replacing a double vat with a new triple vat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3570794066&quot; title=&quot;View 'Hybrid Fryer' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3641/3570794066_cebd1281e2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hybrid Fryer&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astute readers will note that this is not the Frymaster model we were considering last year, but is instead manufactured by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hennypenny.com/&quot;&gt;Henny Penny&lt;/a&gt;. The principle is however the same. The low-oil-volume vat holds just half the volume of a traditional fryer, so we only have to heat half as much oil. To maintain the quality of the oil, the fryer automatically filters the vat after 12 cooking cycles (normally a vat is filtered once daily), and tops itself off when the vat starts to run low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the fryer as just like a hybrid car... the tank is smaller and we have to fill it less often, so we save energy and money. We're looking for both good performance and good gas (er, I mean oil) mileage.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We decided quite suddenly a few days ago that we'll fly to Minnesota for a weel over 4th of July this year. Grandma and Grandpa will be quite pleased to see Christopher, and the weather at the lake should be good for relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we're flying through Newark, we've also decided to spend a weekend in New York City on the way home. Picking a hotel is driving me a little crazy, though, given the high prices and number of choices. Suggestions for a good family hotel are welcome. (And, on another note, can the reviews at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g60763-New_York_City_New_York-Hotels.html&quot;&gt;tripadvisor.com&lt;/a&gt; be trusted?)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rustic furniture</title>

   <updated>2009-05-13T10:45:37+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/05/13/rustic-furniture</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.martinisfortwo.com/2009/05/movin-on-up.html&quot;&gt;Diane's report&lt;/a&gt; of moving her &quot;super-sized, American-made furniture&quot; from Mannheim to Barcelona reminded me that today was a minor expat milestone for us. Today we got rid of the last remaining bits of American furniture we had brought with us back in 1990. It was a bulky oak dining room set that Germans would politely describe as &quot;rustic&quot;. We had tried selling it a few years ago, but found no takers. It's been in the basement since then, and as part of our long-term 2009 basement project it landed on the pile of &quot;Sperrm&amp;uuml;ll&quot; that was to be picked up today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As an aside, how would one refer to &quot;Sperrm&amp;uuml;ll&quot; pickup in English? My father would call it the &quot;dray service&quot;, but that's a quaint 19th century term that's a bit of an inside joke in our family. &quot;Junk pickup&quot; &amp;agrave; la &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_and_Son&quot;&gt;Sanford &amp;amp; Son&lt;/a&gt; maybe?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the furniture will not end up at the dump. The table was picked up a couple weeks ago by a flea-market collector whom we had called to take a look at our stuff. And the 4 chairs disappeared from the pile on the street yesterday, one day before today's pickup. Sperrm&amp;uuml;ll moves in mysterious ways.&lt;/p&gt;

That's a cause we can agree with, but taking up an entire Saturday with a bus trip to Hannover? And, yes, Christopher insisted on taking the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3517884980&quot; title=&quot;View 'photo-4' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/3322/3517884980_ca57ec61bb_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo-4&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was not in on the promise, having taken the time to read the fine print. I did however bring to two of them to the bus pick-up point at 9:30 Saturday morning. We managed to get Christopher to compromise on taking the bus there, but to take the train back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they had a good crowd. 10000 demonstrators (mostly teachers and students) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haz.de/Hannover/Aus-der-Stadt/Uebersicht/10.000-demonstrieren-gegen-Schulpolitik&quot;&gt;protested plans to impose a shortened Abitur in the &quot;Gesamtschule&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (combined schools, like we hope to have built in Jesteburg) and the general lack of funding for education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3517074111&quot; title=&quot;View 'photo-5' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/3611/3517074111_b02fc60699_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo-5&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Frauke and Christopher skipped out after two hours, eating lunch at McDonald's amd taking the ICE back home. They were back by 4 pm, giving Christopher plenty of time to mow the lawn before dark and letting Frauke relax a little bit on her day off and enjoy an outdoor cook-out by yours truly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day was Mother's Day, and Frauke celebrated by doing something she loves... planting flowers, in this case at her restaurant at Hamburg Winsener Strasse. &lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/05/06/east-german-nostalgia</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We just saw a news report about a children's museum exhibit on life in East Germany. I first visited East Berlin in 1981, and a lot has changed since then. The Wall is gone. The Palace of the Republic is gone. The DDR itself is gone. But my souvenir of my first visit remains: an original DDR beer opener, with the stamped Retail Sales Price (Einzelhandelsverkaufspreis = EVP) so you know it's authentic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3507455217&quot; title=&quot;View 'bottle_opener' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3302/3507455217_5afa1f186a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bottle_opener&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;279&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also still functional... buy me a beer, and I can prove it to you! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, at the time 15 DDR Pfennigs was worth about 3 BRD Pfennigs, or somewhat less than 1 US cent.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stripes from Paris</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nest week we start a new remodelling project... the satellite in Marktkauf Center. The design hasn't changed since it opened nearly 8 years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3444266848&quot; title=&quot;View 'Presentation existing' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3566/3444266848_102e3cdeab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Presentation existing&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;354&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designers for McDonald's Europe in Paris have a new series of designs for satellites, and they imagine that our restaurant could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3443451907&quot; title=&quot;View 'Presentation project' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3298/3443451907_46f6006f18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Presentation project&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;354&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transformation will take just 3 days, and the restaurant will remain open throughout construction. The French models photoshopped into the proposed design are not included. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the central M logo is placed on a green background instead of the traditional red. It' part of a new exterior design scheme that's being implemented in Europe. It's a bit hard to get used to after 50 years of red.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/03/14/irish-crab</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We thought we'd be nice to Christopher and let him decide what he wanted for supper last night. He thought long and hard, about 20 minutes, then told us he wanted his favorite meal, crab legs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's had crab several times in the States, most notably at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crabbybills.com/locations.html&quot;&gt;Crabby Bill's&lt;/a&gt; in Florida. However, we have no idea where to find crab in Germany. No restaurant we know of serves it. Last night he had to settle for shrimp cocktail and shrimp soup from our local Greek restaurant. However, he did take the time to tell us with pencil and paper what he really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3355343349&quot; title=&quot;View 'shopping list' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3417/3355343349_a6fa3a7dfe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;shopping list&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we knew the Metro cash-and-carry store has a huge seafood department, and we promised him we would look there today. And sure enough, while they didn't have any crab legs, they did have a 1-lb whole frozen fully cooked Irish crab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3353642373&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0712' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3019/3353642373_809dba35a8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0712&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've never prepared any type of crab at home, and had no idea how long to thaw it out. Looking on the internet, I found recommendations to let it thaw overnight, but that surely wouldn't do for the impatient Christopher. We left it it cold water for 2 hours, then boiled it for 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/3354470366&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0713' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3465/3354470366_658525a14d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0713&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also do not have the proper utensils for eating crab, so yes, that is a garden shears that he used to crack open the legs. He said the crab tasted as good as he remembers from Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will think twice, though, before we ask him again what he would like for supper.&lt;/p&gt;

We know about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/information/&quot;&gt;Deutsches Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and we might take a day trip to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zugspitze.de/main_en.php&quot;&gt;Zugspitze&lt;/a&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While helping (well, actually watching) me clean out our basement, Christopher discovered Frauke's typewriter (which he immediately dubbed an &quot;antique&quot;) and asked if he could try it out. This evening we let him at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After experimenting a bit, he put in a fresh sheet of paper and spent over an hour preparing a &quot;report&quot; on snakes, with lists of species of snakes, what they eat, what eats them, and where they are found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards he declared that, unlike us, he does not need a computer to print things out, he can just do it himself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>School Daze</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/02/10/school-daze/"/>
   <updated>2009-02-10T05:07:15+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/02/10/school-daze</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week was mid-term vacation for our school, and as a 3rd grader Christopher got his first report card with real grades. His grades were pretty good, we thought. One of the quirks of German family life seems to be that kids are to share their grades or show their report cards to anyone who asks. I remember that my report cards were a private matter between me, my parents and the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though it seems like he just started school yesterday, it's time to start thinking seriously about what comes next. Elementary school ends after grade 4; at grade 5 the three-tiered German school system kicks in, with the kids divided into higher, middle and lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a number of misgivings about the school system, and while Christopher is doing fine right now, we're not sure he will be well-served by the school system as it now stands. Here are some of my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have no experience with the 3-tiered system and don't understand the reasons for it. A big part of American schools is learning social competence, to be able to get along with all of your fellow citizens, and that seems to be missing when the kids are divided up so early. I've heard reports that social background (as opposed to talent or intelligence) plays a bigger role in students' success in Germany than elsewhere, so maybe the division has as much to do with class as with competence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no local control of schools as in the US. Schools are a matter for the individual states (Bundesl&amp;auml;nder), and any decision regarding schools has to go through the hierarchical bureaucracy, for us from county (Winsen) to the district (L&amp;uuml;neburg) and to the state (Hannover).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that education is a state political issue. The CDU tends to prefer the traditional 3-tiered system, the SPD and Greens tend to prefer reforms. School policy, and the school system, will change when new parties take over. Any aspect of the present system may disappear when a new party takes over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians don't know anything about education, and will make policy changes to achieve their own goals rather than to improve education. For example, in Hamburg the CDU was for the traditional 3-tiered system while the Greens were for a comprehensive system. In their coalition, they compromised to start the 3 tiers at grade 7 instead of grade 5. Most states have now shortened the upper Gymnasium track from 9 to 8 years for cost reasons, but without any plan for adjusting the curriculum so that the same material is being taught in less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education seems to be chronically underfunded. Facilities seem to be run down, and (at least in our state) parents are required to pay for books and materials for the classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our community does not have a secondary school of its own. So no matter what level we choose for Christopher, he will have to be bussed to another town. There is an active citizens' group to establish a school here, and while they're at it then a comprehensive school for all levels. They even have a Wordpress-based website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://schulkonzept.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Jesteburger BildungsBlog&lt;/a&gt;. They of course have to deal with 3 levels of bureacracy, and it's a slow process. We hope they are successful, but we doubt that anything can be achieved before our decision for Christopher is due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a rural community, so we don't have a lot of alternatives. There is a church-based school in Buchholz, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education&quot;&gt;Waldorf&lt;/a&gt; school about 15 km away. Going to Hamburg is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very happy with our elementary school, but we don't hear any good things about the local Gymnasium. They seem to be inflexible educational factories... you'll do fine if you go along and fit the mold, if not you'll fall by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently heard a report how elementary schools here are somewhat biased against boys, with the lack of male teachers as role models and the emphasis of creative language skills over math skills. I can't say whether that's true, but it seemed to fit Christopher's experience thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does all this mean for Christopher's education? We don't know yet, but we're looking at alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning, I had to wait a few minutes before I could enter the kitchen. Mama and Christopher were busy lighting and couning tea canndles on the kitchen table. The first time they had 53 instead of 47, but at this stage of life, what do 6 extra candles really matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm not German, I'm not supersticious about celebrating birthdays early, so I went ahead and bought myself a present a couple of weeks ago, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_boom.html&quot;&gt;Squeezebox Boom network music player&lt;/a&gt;. Note the classy and elegant title currently playing. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love reading bloggers like Tim Bray who can make connections between seemingly disconnected fields, in his case tech and politics. Here's how he experienced the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/01/21/Inauguration&quot;&gt;inauguration&lt;/a&gt; in a hotel lobby in San Jose, where the entire room broke in to applause (it's a short entry, I'm quoting it nearly entirely):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... in Silicon Valley, the entrepreneurs and engineers, while mostly men, are a mixed bag ethnically, and their language is English. But the people who work the reception desks and wash the floors and bring the coffee and provide security, their skins are all black and brown (no whites); they have heavy accents and talk lots of different languages, some I can&amp;rsquo;t even identify, to each other. It&amp;rsquo;s been that way long as I can remember. This apparently-fixed class/race background is one of the things that bothers me about the Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the applause was maybe a little louder from the (standing) hotel employees than the (sitting) business breakfasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If&amp;nbsp;Christopher were an experienced fisherman, he'd tell the world he caught this crappie on Lac qui Parle Lake last weekend. But he's too honest for that. We didn't get a bite during our short time on the ice, which was cut short on account of an incoming snow storm. This fish was caught by our host the night before. Thanks to my brother's friend Gary and his family for having us out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Auto Blogroll with Google Reader</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/12/09/auto-blogroll-with-google-reader/"/>
   <updated>2008-12-09T03:00:37+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/12/09/auto-blogroll-with-google-reader</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I overheard &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/NewWrldYankee&quot;&gt;@AmiExpat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/NewWrldYankee&quot;&gt;@NewWrldYankee&lt;/a&gt; twittering about how annoying it is deal with link requests and keep a blogroll. My solution to that used to be to keep an automatic list of blogs I actually read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time I had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/07/blogroll-timestamps-with-perl-and-bloglines/&quot;&gt;bunch of scripts to do the dirty work&lt;/a&gt; (don't bother looking for them, they seem to be gone from SourceForge) that would pull my readling list from Bloglines and output a list for my sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was 2004, this is now, and with Google Reader and WordPress you don't have to do any of the dirty work yourself. It's pretty easy these days to list a subset of the blogs you read (keeping your sexblogs secret, of course) on practically any weblog.  On WordPress there is even a widget that makes it easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Google Reader you can choose to &lt;a href=&quot;http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/11/attack-of-20ers.html&quot;&gt;make one or more of your tags public&lt;/a&gt;. Go to your settings page, then under &quot;Folders and Tags&quot; you can choose to &quot;change sharing&quot; for the tags you choose. You then get links for a number of ways to share the articles or blogs that have this tag. Under &quot;add a blogroll to your site&quot; you can get some javascript to copy and paste into your blog template to get a blogroll.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who use WordPress, copying and pasting is too much work.  There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-reader-blogroll-widget/&quot;&gt;Google Reader Blogroll Widget&lt;/a&gt; that does the dirty work for us. Once you've made the folder public in Google Reader, just activate the the widget, copy in one of the links, and you're good to go. This in effect sets up the same javascript you could copy in by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally don't like putting in external scripts on my site, otherwise your site ends up to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de&quot;&gt;widget hell&lt;/a&gt; that takes ages to load and hangs if any of them happen to break. I've had good experience with scripts from Google, though, and face it... if Google is broken, the entire internet is probably broken as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I've made my &quot;expat&quot; tag public, and anytime I give the tag to a new blog, it gets added to the list. And if for any reason I stop reading a blog, it disappears from the list as well. The one thing it doesn't do automatically is remove dead and outdated links... the deadwood has to be cleaned out by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in more of the stuff I read, I've also set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/reading-list/&quot;&gt;mega-list of seveal of my tags&lt;/a&gt; as a separate page&lt;/p&gt;

We've started selling two for the price of one... i.e. two for 8.49¬Ä.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second Sunday in Advent is of course the perfect time to buy an advent calendar. You can open the first 7 doors all at once, and can still enjoy a daily treat for more than two weeks until Christmas. You get both instant gratification and daily satisfaction. What more could you ask for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For PapaScott readers I have an exclusive deal. For a limited time, you can buy calenders from me directly and I will donate the entire purchase price to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-kinderhilfe.org/&quot;&gt;McDonald's Kinderhilfe&lt;/a&gt; (the German Ronald McDonald Houses). Postage costs within Germany are 3¬Ä for 2 or 4 calendars, 5¬Ä for 6 to 10 calendars, or you can pick them up directly. Payment by bank transfer, PayPal, or cash upon pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 calendars: 8.49 plus 3.00 = 11.49¬Ä&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 calendars: 16.98 plus 3.00 = 19.98¬Ä&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 calendars: 25.47 plus 5.00 = 30.47¬Ä&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 calendars: 42.45 plus 5.00 = 47.45¬Ä&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the longer you wait, the more chocolate you have to eat the first day. So order today! This piece of history can be yours to keep (at least as long as the chocolate lasts)! Order today, via the comments, Twitter (@papascott) or mail &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:papascott@gmail.com&quot;&gt;papascott@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;. Supplies are limited!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/12/03/swimming-in-the-adria</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote the following as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yankeeinnewworld.com/2008/12/02/from-papa-scott-as-an-expat-travel-may-not-be-what-you-think/&quot;&gt;guest post&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yankeeinnewworld.com/&quot;&gt;Yankee In A New World&lt;/a&gt;, an American studying in Hungary. Reading her blog reminded me of the one time I visited Hungary and that we haven't seen as much of Eastern Europe as we would like. This is not so much about what we saw as about how we got there, and almost didn't get back...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing about becoming a settled expat is that you are not able to be see as much of your new country and continent as you might think. Yes, in Germany we get 6 weeks vacation per year, but most of that is used either to visit friends and family on the old continent or to show visitors from the old continent things you've already seen yourself. My parents saw more of Europe on a 3-week bus tour than I've seen in 18 years living here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our only true European adventure was back in 1996. We had just signed&lt;br /&gt;
the contract to buy a house, and figured (rightly, as it turned out)&lt;br /&gt;
that our time and money would be severely strained for the next couple&lt;br /&gt;
of year. If we wanted to take a proper vacation, we had to do it now.&lt;br /&gt;
But since we had just put most of our savings into the down payment,&lt;br /&gt;
cost was a major issue. So we decided to do a Eastern European camping&lt;br /&gt;
trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife had a business conference in Prague that June, and we used&lt;br /&gt;
that as our jumping-off point. She had a decent company car, but&lt;br /&gt;
wasn't allowed to drive it the the &quot;New East&quot;, so I drove to Prague in&lt;br /&gt;
my Renault R5 (similar to a Volkswagen Golf, except French and less&lt;br /&gt;
reliable... in fact it died for good a year later). Loaded down with 2&lt;br /&gt;
bicycles and a hatch full of camping equipment, I pulled up to the&lt;br /&gt;
Prague Hilton and spirited my wife away. Still in her business&lt;br /&gt;
clothes, she was brought to our tent at a campground literally on the&lt;br /&gt;
wrong side of the tracks. The next few days we were then able to take&lt;br /&gt;
a closer look at the sights that she'd had only seen from the tour&lt;br /&gt;
bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was Lake Balaton in Hungary, which wasn't quite what we&lt;br /&gt;
imagined (too shallow and muddy). &quot;I want to swim in the blue ocean on&lt;br /&gt;
my birthday,&quot; said my wife, and pointed to Istria on the map, just a&lt;br /&gt;
hop, skip and a jump through Croatia away. The map was, however&lt;br /&gt;
deceiving. What looked like 3 hours actually took 10. For one thing I&lt;br /&gt;
had to wait over an hour at the border for a Croatian visa (lesson for&lt;br /&gt;
spontaneous travel decisions... check visa requirements). In addition,&lt;br /&gt;
the road from the border to Zagreb wasn't exactly paved, and the&lt;br /&gt;
motorway from Zagreb to the coast wasn't yet exactly complete, so we&lt;br /&gt;
spent hours snaking through the hills under half-finished bridges. But&lt;br /&gt;
we arrived at a wonderful campground on the coast with hundreds of&lt;br /&gt;
spaces, but only 10% occupied since the war had only been over for a&lt;br /&gt;
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we knew about the bad roads, we decided to return to Hungary&lt;br /&gt;
via Slovenia and Austria for our last stop in Budapest. We found a&lt;br /&gt;
beautiful campground on a wooded hill overlooking the city. It was&lt;br /&gt;
great in the morning to coast with our bikes down to the river. It was&lt;br /&gt;
not so much fun evenings to trudge with our bikes uphill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, bikes are a great way to explore a new city, and we'd&lt;br /&gt;
certainly do it again, but without the R5 and without the tent. Last&lt;br /&gt;
year we took a bike tour of Barcelona and loved it (except for the&lt;br /&gt;
road up the mountain to the Citadel). Between the sights you have the&lt;br /&gt;
chance to see the city from street level and get a feel for its pulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even today I shudder to think... what if our R5 had broken down on&lt;br /&gt;
that dirt road in Croatia. Would we have gotten anywhere with our&lt;br /&gt;
German auto club card?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Breakfast Awards</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/12/02/breakfast-awards/"/>
   <updated>2008-12-02T18:57:31+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/12/02/breakfast-awards</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To push the launch of the new breakfast, our McDonald's North German region held a contest over the past 2 months for all 225 restaurants in northern Germany. Cash awards were given in three categories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Top 10 stores with the best breakfast sales increase&lt;br /&gt;
* Top 3 stores with the best breakfast marketing (as determined by an independent jury)&lt;br /&gt;
* Top 10 stores with the best McCaf&amp;eacute; sales increase (just to keep everyone on their toes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our restaurant in Dibbersen was able to present itself quite well. Out of the 225 restaurants...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* we placed 3rd in breakfast sales increase with 47.9%&lt;br /&gt;
* we placed 2nd in the marketing contest&lt;br /&gt;
* we placed in the top 20% (but not in the top 10) in McCaf&amp;eacute; sales increase&lt;br /&gt;
* we were the only restaurant to place in the money in more than one contest and are therefore number one in cash and prizes (just like we won the jackpot at Wheel of Fortune... thank you,  Vanna!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prize money will of course be paid out in full as bonus to our management and crew. We'll pay all payroll taxes, they'll receive the prize money as net pay... not that we are complaining. We thank them all and we are very proud of what they have accomplished. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Expat Meetup in Bremen we know the number one tourist attraction, so when Christopher and I were in town for business at the US Consulate, we made sure to stop by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we weren't able to renew Christopher's passport as planned. The US State Department has tightened the rules on parental consent, and both parents must sign the application in person. A notarized consent form is no longer accepted unless it is physically impossible for the parent to appear. &quot;In prison&quot; was the example we were given. &quot;Being a busy businesswoman&quot; doesn't cut it. Luckily Christopher has a understanding if busy mother, so Christopher's application will have the missing signature within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information on &lt;a href=&quot;http://germany.usembassy.gov/germany/services/passport_issuance.html&quot;&gt;germany.usembassy.gov&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat confusing on this point, but now that I've given my constructive feedback, I'm sure they'll get the details fixed soon. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Paper Chase</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/11/15/paper-chase/"/>
   <updated>2008-11-15T09:56:26+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/11/15/paper-chase</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we decided to form a separate firm for our two new restaurants in Harburg, we had assumed that forming a KG (limited partnership) would be easier and faster than forming the GmbH (limited liability corporation) we set up last year. So far it hasn't been the case. Coordinating the paperwork between us, McDonald's, the attorney, the tax accountant, the chamber of commerce &lt;em&gt;(Handelskammer)&lt;/em&gt;, and the commercial register &lt;em&gt;(Handelsregister)&lt;/em&gt; has so far been just as complicated if not worse, and we haven't even started with the last two yet. Last year the GmbH was not officially registered until two weeks after we started business. Legally, we were running on a hope and a prayer for 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we've run into technical snafus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first draft of the KG contract was sent to us via email. The sender had never corresponded with us before, and Gmail thus classified the attachment full of legal language as spam. We discovered the mail 4 days later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to fax the contract for approval, the recipient didn't answer. After a few trys, and checking that the number was correct, we called the office. The fax machine had been disconnected. &quot;Oh, that's why we haven't gotten any faxes this week.&quot; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corrections to the contract were faxed to our private voice number, which we've never given out for business, and without caller ID so we had no idea who was trying to fax. After three tries, I guessed that it must be something important... I forwarded the voice line to the fax number and hoped that they would try a fourth time. They did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow it's reassuring that the technical glitches of the last century can still occur in this one. And, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/papascott/statuses/1005568106&quot;&gt;I asked on Twitter yesterday&lt;/a&gt;,  if anyone knows of a good service to forward received faxes to a mail or web server, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Expansion</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/11/11/expansion/"/>
   <updated>2008-11-11T20:48:23+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/11/11/expansion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our business is expanding! On January 1, we'll be purchasing two additional McDonald's restaurants in Hamburg-Harburg: a free-standing McDrive with McCaf&amp;eacute; on the Winsener Strasse 231, and a satellite restaurant in the Marktkauf Center, Seeveplatz 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winsener Strasse is the closest restaurant to our original store in Dibbersen, and is nearly a twin. It was built just a few months earlier, has the same basic layout, and like Dibbersen was just remodeled with McCaf&amp;eacute; and Gym &amp;amp; Fun. It has also an additional challenge... a Burger King is situated right next door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marktkaufcenter-harburg.de/&quot;&gt;Marktkauf Center&lt;/a&gt; satellite is a limited-menu shopping center restaurant with limited seating in downtown Harburg. There are two other McDonald's satellites within walking distance (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phoenix-center-harburg.de&quot;&gt;Phoenix Center&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harburg-arcaden.de/&quot;&gt;Harburg Arcaden&lt;/a&gt;), so we'll have to concentrate on the guests in our shopping center and giving them the best experience possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've set up a separate firm, the Petersen-Hanson Familienrestaurants KG, to run the two restaurants in Harburg. We've also reserved the domain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-harburg.de/&quot;&gt;mcdonalds-harburg.de&lt;/a&gt;, which for now redirects to our existing website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were offered the restaurants at the end of September, just before the Expat Meetup in Bremen. So if my fellow expats are wondering why I was somewhat reserved at the Meetup, you now know why (although I'm not all that extroverted to begin with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes for our day-to-day routine will likely be as big as when we bought the first restaurant in Dibbersen, as we'll have to shift our efforts from managing a single restaurant to supervising three. On my side, I expect the administration to at least quadruple, since we'll not only have three times the paperwork, but will have take the time to decide how it all should be allocated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An immediate consequence is that our Christmas trip to the States will be cut short, at least for Frauke. We'll fly in together on the 23rd, but she'll fly home on the 27th to complete the takeover, while Christopher and I will be staying in Minnesota for another week. We'll be together with my parents for the two most important holidays of the year, Christmas and Christopher's birthday, and as long as we can round up a Christmas goose for the annual goose leg dinner, we can manage the few days apart.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Yes We Can in 2036</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher followed the US election campaign quite closely, and was a staunch supporter of Obama. He kept informed with the children's news program Logo on KiKa and made sure he didn't miss any US news when they showed up on the adult news programs. He told us to wake him up this morning with the result was know, and we all three watched Obama's victory speech at 6am German time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher is especially fascinated by Obama's heritage. He is aware of race is the naive way we wish children would never outgrow. Brown skin is just fine with him, since his best friend Ergin in kindergarten was Turkish and also had brown skin. The past couple of weeks we've had a mixture of brown and white eggs in our refrigerator. Christopher dubbed them Obama eggs and McCain eggs, and made sure we ate the McCain eggs first. Our egg tray is now 100% for Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher is also aware of Obama's mixed parentage, an American and a non-American, and that this is a trait the two share. For now anyway, Christopher wants to follow in Obama's footsteps. His career goal of the moment is to become President of the United States, and as a natural born US citizen, he meets the basic qualification. His previous career goal was Chief Designer for LEGO Group in Denmark, and maybe he will find a way to combine the two goals.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course the results are gong to look like &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3895&quot;&gt;this map from lumma.de&lt;/a&gt;. It's like asking little kids what they would do if they had a pony... the answers may be cute but not particularly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect the truth is actually closer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,586770,00.html&quot;&gt;this interview with Robert Kagen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eamonn.com/2008/10/europe_exactly.htm&quot;&gt;(from Rainy Day)&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPIEGEL: An overwhelming majority of Europeans want to see Barack Obama become president...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KAGAN: Yes, of the United States, although they would never elect someone like that in their own countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally have a list of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/2008/09/easy-morning-fruehstueckskarte/&quot;&gt;new breakfast products&lt;/a&gt; online (also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/Menuekarte_Fruehstueck.pdf&quot;&gt;as PDF&lt;/a&gt;), for those of you that can't make it to our restaurant and have been wondering what all the fuss is about. The text and pictures are from the menu cards we've had on the tables since September,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the new breakfast for now is only available in northern Germany, the national McDonald's website doesn't mention any of the new products yet (although they do have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/presse/index.php?pressid=266&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;). We usually link to them for product information, but this time we had to rely on ourselves (and my graphic &quot;talent&quot; in cutting and pasting from a PDF).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Harz Highlights 1</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher has school vacation, and we took a few days off and spent four nights in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harz&quot;&gt;Harz&lt;/a&gt;, the German mountain range between Niedersachsen and Sachsen-Anhalt. It's popular for short trips, but doesn't seem to be as well known for foreign tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2955058273&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0583' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3294/2955058273_9204ee2fdf_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0583&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first highlight was taking the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsb-wr.de/&quot;&gt;HSB narrow-guage steam engine train&lt;/a&gt; to the top of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocken&quot;&gt;Brocken&lt;/a&gt;, the highest mountain in the Harz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2955193653&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0578' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3070/2955193653_dd58286f94_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0578&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2955060245&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0575' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3201/2955060245_255d969886_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0575&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legend has is that the Brocken was a meeting place for witches, and more recently it was a closed military installation during DDR days. Today it's again open to the public, and the witches are used to market every little hotel, shop and restaurant in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on the Brocken, Christopher had the chance to fly around the mountain on a witch's broomstick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2955056193&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0594' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3200/2955056193_818424ed3e_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0594&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, as with most magic is was only smoke and mirrors, or in this case a video camera with a blue-screen background. In fact, the weather was foggy and just above freezing during our visit. We couldn't even see the TV tower from right below it, much less any view from the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2955055401&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0597' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3187/2955055401_74caa1612b_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0597&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being cheap and mean parents, we only bought one-way train tickets, thus forcing Christopher to hike with us 7 km down the mountain back to our car. Strangely enough, Christopher found the flat portions of the trail boring and exhausting, but thought it was great fun to crawl over boulders on the middle portion of the trail. We'll remember to take him only on difficult trails in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just a note that our Easy Morning for Free was a huge success, and we have the newspaper article scanned in at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/2008/10/easy-morning-for-free-ein-voller-erfolg/&quot;&gt;our restaurant homepage&lt;/a&gt; (or click on the picture for a pdf).

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next Tuesday, in a promotion in the &quot;so crazy it has to work&quot; category, we hope to give away 1000 McMuffins between 6:00 and 10:30 am in a promotion we call &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/2008/10/easy-morning-for-free/&quot;&gt;Easy Morning for Free&lt;/a&gt;. The daily HAN newspaper in Hamburg-Harburg will be printing a coupon on page 1 of their Monday edition that is good for a McMuffin Bacon &amp;amp; Egg and a coffee, which we usually sell for 1.99&amp;euro;. Here's the teaser report from last Thursday, (also as &lt;a title=&quot;Gratis-Fru&amp;#776;hstu&amp;#776;ck-web.pdf&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/gratis-fruhstuck-web.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/hangratisfruehstueck.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;HANGratisFruehstueck.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;615&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series of free promotions in the HAN, and their readers have lined up in the past for free car washes, cheese from the farmers' market, or cake at a caf&amp;eacute;. The top number so far was 1000 coupons, and we'd love to match that, although there are a couple of limiting factors for us (breakfast ends at 10:30, we're not reachable by public transit, and we certainly don't have 1000 parking places). But even if we &quot;only&quot; give away 300 McMuffins, that's still more than double our usual breakfast guest count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea, of course, is to promote our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/2008/08/easy-morning-early-morning/&quot;&gt;new breakfast offerings&lt;/a&gt; which made their debut in northern Germany on September 9 (and coming to the rest of Germany in the coming months). I'll write more about how breakfast is working for us later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vintage Expats</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/10/02/vintage-expats/"/>
   <updated>2008-10-02T15:34:55+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/10/02/vintage-expats</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I was finally able to attend the annual Whiny Expat Blogger Meetup, organized the past 4 years by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbittner.com/germany/&quot;&gt;J&lt;/a&gt;. Good thing, since when we were voting on the location it was my idea to stuff the ballot box for Bremen so we'd finally have a northern location. So while most folks had to travel for hours to arrive, I could just hop on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.der-metronom.de/&quot;&gt;Metronom&lt;/a&gt; for a 45 minute train trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://claireseuroamerica.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt; organized the details in Bremen and did a wonderful job, even preparing little welcome kits for us all. She herded our group of 25 (including strollers) through the city, parked us on the Weser riverbank to enjoy the sun for lunch, and reserved excellent places for dinner and for Sunday brunch. She didn't plan the excursion to the back room of a gay bar Saturday night, that just happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our foreign experience ranged from brand-new to old-hat, so we had people all along the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief&quot;&gt;5 stages of being an expat&lt;/a&gt;. We old-timers couldn't promise the newcomers that things would get better with time, but we could reassure them that they would eventually get used to it (final stage: acceptance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm horrible at names, so I won't try to mention everyone I met, and I know I didn't get the chance to talk to everyone. I will mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elmada.com/&quot;&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://justcallmemausi.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Mausi&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom I've read for ages and I was finally able to meet. Most people seem to be shy about their names, so I'll just say it was nice meeting you all, and I've added your blogs to my feed reader. And I hope to see you all next time, be it in Berlin or Regensburg, or wherever.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Oslo Cruise</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/09/08/oslo-cruise/"/>
   <updated>2008-09-08T11:08:28+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/09/08/oslo-cruise</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Noone solved the riddle of our weekend destination in my last post. Indeed, noone even seemed to recognize that it was a riddle. Frauke, Christopher and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in a suite on the MS Color Fantasy, a ferry that shuttles between Kiel and Oslo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2839637646&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0867' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/2839637646_84d0ae5309.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0867&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was similar to the trip we took a year ago last spring, except then we departed from Copenhagen with the Danish DFDS, and this time from Kiel with the Norwegian Color Line. We left Friday afternoon, arrived in Oslo Saturday morning for a quick 4 hour stay, just enough time for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fram.museum.no/en/&quot;&gt;Fram museum&lt;/a&gt;, the Holmenkollen ski jump, and the Vigeland Park). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2840121542&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0902' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3053/2840121542_a4edba6915.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0902&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived back in Kiel Sunday morning. We waited a couple of hours before heading home as all roads to L&amp;uuml;llau were closed for the Cyclassics race. We went to the beach at Laboe, checked out the WWII U-Boat and checked out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meeresbiologie-laboe.de/&quot;&gt;Marine Biology Station&lt;/a&gt;, a small Baltic aquarium and learning center we can highly recommend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then arrived home to find our door blocked with flowers. I guess that was the revenge for us leaving the country without telling our employees where we were going. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2839669372&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0537.JPG' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/2839669372_dd321c0ba1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0537.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A personal note for my family... aboard the Fram we noticed a framed copy of the Christmas menu from 1893. Our Norwegian is not very good, but it was good enough to recognize that there is &lt;em&gt;no lutefisk!&lt;/em&gt; The museum did have a number of empty aquavit bottles from the ship, though.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Moment of Silence</title>

   <updated>2008-09-05T07:55:32+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/09/05/moment-of-silence</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In commemoration of the events that occurred &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/09/young-dumb-and-excited/&quot;&gt;25 years ago tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; (for which all photographic evidence seems to have disappeared, much to the chagrin of the participants), the weblog PapaScott will remain silent today and for the weekend. All three members of the Petersen-Hanson family are away observing the anniversary &quot;in the near abroad, within our traditional sphere of influence&quot;, as Vladimir Putin would probably say. One could also say that they have disappeared from the face of the earth for a couple of days, but will return home on Sunday evening to fulfill their respective obligations. We kindly request your understanding and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hereby submit the following documentation. Click to enlarge.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Right of Way</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/08/29/right-of-way/"/>
   <updated>2008-08-29T12:19:48+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/08/29/right-of-way</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Even after 18 years of driving in Germany, I still have problems following my instincts with right of way at intersections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German rule is &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorfahrtsregel&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rechts vor Links&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or right before left. That's the same as I learned in driver's training in Minnesota. In the words of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dps.state.mn.us/dvs/DLTraining/DLManual/DLManual.htm&quot;&gt;Minnesota Driver's Manual&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When two vehicles reach an intersection at the same time, and there is no traffic light or signal, the driver of the vehicle on the left must yield to the vehicle on the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But at T-intersections, a different rule applies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When two vehicles approach an uncontrolled &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo; intersection, the driver of the vehicle that is turning must yield to all cross traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/100px-zeichen-306svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;100px-Zeichen_306.svg.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;In other words, straight before turns. In Germany this doesn't apply. &quot;Right before left&quot; applies to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stvo/__8.html&quot;&gt;both T- and regular intersections&lt;/a&gt;. When a cowpath adjoins a highway, traffic from the highway must yield to traffic from the right on the cowpath unless right-of-way is posted on the highway with a &lt;em&gt;Vorfahrtstra&amp;szlig;e&lt;/em&gt; sign. Ninety percent of T-intersections have such a sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's at the T-intersections that aren't posted where I have problems. I consciously think &quot;This is a T-intersection, I can't follow my instincts&quot;, and I end up yielding to everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This drives my wife nuts, but I suspect that if it's gone on this long, I'll never outgrow it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Passport Renewal</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/08/27/passport-renewal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/11/02/one-of-us-now/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/chrpass-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chrpass_thumb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;163&quot; height=&quot;137&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's now been six years since we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/10/02/our-visit-to-the-consulate/&quot;&gt;submitted the application&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/10/15/pictures-for-the-passport/&quot;&gt;took the pictures&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/11/02/one-of-us-now/&quot;&gt;obtained&lt;/a&gt; Christopher's US passport. That means the passport expired nearly a year ago, and it's time to apply for a new one before we visit the States this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://germany.usembassy.gov/germany/services/passport_issuance.html&quot;&gt;rules online&lt;/a&gt;, and have the forms completed and the documents gathered. Two things have changed since last time. For one, the consulate in Hamburg no longer processes passports, so we have to go to either Berlin or Bremen. Secondly, if both parents don't appear in person, the written consent of the missing parent must be notarized. I don't want to trouble Frauke to come along, but I have no idea what they need for a notary (it's &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the same as a German &lt;em&gt;Notar&lt;/em&gt;).  (The consulate will &lt;a href=&quot;http://germany.usembassy.gov/germany/services/notarial_services.html&quot;&gt;notarize her consent&lt;/a&gt; for free, but that kind of defeats the purpose of saving Frauke the trip.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Christopher has school now every day, and the passport office is only open during the week, so it looks like the three of us will be taking a road trip to Bremen one day during fall school vacation in October.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;German Joys (responding to the Spiegel article last week on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,567038,00.html&quot;&gt;Beta Bloggers&lt;/a&gt;) on why &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2008/07/internet-die-beta-blogger---netzwelt---spiegel-online---nachrichten.html&quot;&gt;Germans are such poor bloggers&lt;/a&gt;. Point 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. A national culture of modesty that frowns upon too much self-expression. Americans have the advantage here. They're hardly afraid of looking like fools, and like to talk about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/&quot;&gt;Herr Lumma&lt;/a&gt; will be interested in point 4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Germany's hierarchical, party-driven, elite-dominated political structure doesn't foster the belief that ordinary citizens can meaningfully change government policies ... there is no critical mass of people who consider the Internet a tool for positive &lt;em&gt;political mobilization&lt;/em&gt; (rather than ranting), [thus] there is no real incentive to try to form mass movements or raise large amounts of money on-line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I'll try to take point 1 more to heart and play the fool here more often.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Do I Miss The Tech Stuff?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While chatting via email with Shelley, one of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://burningbird.net/&quot;&gt;favorite bloggers&lt;/a&gt;, she asked first about the business and then about me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you ever miss the tech stuff?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, um, yes, er, sometimes, oh, maybe... I do miss being an expert. I was very good at managing networks, and was very good explaining and using my expertise with others. I understand maybe 30% (at best) of the restaurant business, and defer most of the time to Frauke's experience and the experience of those in our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't miss the conflicting expectations of those who design, sell and market tech applications and those who implement them. I spent a lot of my time playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/quotes&quot;&gt;HAL in 2001&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that&quot;), or at least explaining that things were a lot more difficult to implement than they seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do find the social aspects of helping to run a business much more fulfilling than anything I did in tech. Not that selling hamburgers is a social ideal (but then, neither was selling journals, banking systems, cars, or a dating service, like my various tech employers). But working with and getting to know 70 employees, and maybe helping some of them work out their problems or achieve more of their potential, whether by moving up with us or moving out to something better, that's extremely gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can't say that I'm &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; out of tech. I do get to enter a lot of data in Excel. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

We refer to it as &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.arcor.de/wikingerlager.de/Org/Lager/Lager.htm&quot;&gt;Viking Camp&lt;/a&gt;, since the weather for our trips is always so frigid that only a Viking could feel at home. Well, at least one time it was. It looks like this time it will only be wet. We'll be back Sunday evening to wring ourselves out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the McDonald's insiders who follow our restaurant via PapaScott... we just got our second ISC for the month, and while the TET was a bit high (so no perfect score), we have a zero CSO for the fourth month in a row. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Poor Reception</title>

   <updated>2008-05-28T05:35:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/05/28/poor-reception</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Frauke has the sometimes annoying characteristic of using her accelerator as a stress-relief device. If, for whatever reason, she become angry or frustrated while driving, she steps on the accelerator and drives faster. In certain situations this can be counter-productive, for example, when she's having trouble finding her destination. She can't find the place she's looking for, she gets mad, steps on the gas, and drives right on past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happens, I've learned through experience that it's best not to say anything, since in these situations Frauke is not very receptive to suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was rudely reminded this morning of the relationship between receptiveness and technology this morning at 4 am. Our security company called and spoke on the answering machine, which is integrated in our telephone. Frauke wanted to return the call, but in her just-awakened-state was unable to locate the number in the phone, and called for me to find it for her (as if my just-awakened-state would be any clearer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Siemens phone stores incoming numbers in various places, depending on whether the call was taken, missed, or a message was left. In this case, to get the number one has to first listen to the message. Since Frauke wasn't interested in the message, only the number, she was unable to find it in her 4 am state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if the call had come in on her iPhone, she would have had a much easier time finding the number. The iPhone interface is better for poor reception.&lt;/p&gt;

(Today &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/manitowoc-rejoins-battle-enodis-211/story.aspx?guid={1145C807-9C4A-4583-AD43-3BFFC1B54524}&quot;&gt;Manitowok increased it's offer to $2.1 billion&lt;/a&gt;). All three are big suppliers to McDonald's,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our kitchen, the biggest pieces of equipment are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.garland-group.com/&quot;&gt;Garland&lt;/a&gt; grills and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frymaster.com/&quot;&gt;Frymaster&lt;/a&gt; fryers. Both come from divisions of Enodis. In fact, we're looking at investing in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frymaster.com/?xhtml=xhtml/fry/us/en/general/protector.html&amp;amp;xsl=root.xsl&quot;&gt;new energy-efficient low-oil-volume fryer&lt;/a&gt; from Frymaster this year (right now the low dollar makes the price attractive). Our beverage system, on the other hand, comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manitowocbeverage.com/&quot;&gt;Multiplex&lt;/a&gt; division of Manitowok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of the bidding war will not of course affect our investment decision. And we don't know whether the consolidation will result in more efficiency with lower prices or higher prices due to reduced competition. We just need to increase our fryer capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week we installed signs on the Autobahn A1 a couple of km on either side of the Dibbersen exit. So whether you are coming from Bremen or from Hamburg and you didn't know about our McDonald's in Dibbersen, you will now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German restrictions on such signs are very strict, so compared to what you see on American interstates, the signs are small, low to the ground, and set quite far from the highway. They also are not cheap; we need a dozen additional guests each day for the signs to be worth the cost. If the past couple of days are any indication, the signs seem to be working, although business could also be up as a result of the cooler weather and the Euro promotion that just started (mmmm, mini-schnitzels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very difficult to take a picture of a small sign from a moving car, so for now I have to settle for showing the digital proof.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Frauke and the iPhone</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/05/06/frauke-and-the-iphone/"/>
   <updated>2008-05-06T08:33:14+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/05/06/frauke-and-the-iphone</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I bought myself an iPhone. Nothing really special about that (except that T-Mobile dropped their prices 2 days after I ordered), and I never talked about it here (although I did mention it on Twitter a few times). And I love it. Nothing special about that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the moment Frauke saw it, she became insanely jealous. That &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; unusual. Frauke is pragmatic when it comes to technology. She's not attracted to bright shiny objects like many of us. She holds all my Apple equipment in disdain... at least she did until she saw the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can use this, there's nothing new to learn. I want one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her corporate life Frauke was a happy Blackberry user. For a small business, however, a Blackberry mail server is not worth the bother, and with a normal IMAP or POP account you lose all the sync benefits. We decided to put our mail domain on Google. Frauke got an MDA Vario II smartphone, but she never really used it for mail. Other than contacts and calendar, she never used any of the &quot;smart&quot; features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/2470547320&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0848' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3057/2470547320_8ce23d8089_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0848&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Coincidentally, a couple of days after she saw my iPhone her MDA hat a close encounter with the edge of the dress table in the restaurant kitchen. It's an occupational hazard. Frauke has bruises on her hip more often than not. This time her smartphone took the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She didn't even wait for a repair estimate. We bought out the remaining 17 months on her MDA contract and ordered her iPhone. With the reduced price plus the penalty, she paid about the same as the old price I paid a month ago. Last week (after some aggravation with T-Mobile's activation server) we synced the calendar and contacts from Outlook (useless as a mail client but nice for storing sync data) and away she went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had no problems learning to use the on-screen keyboard. Her only complaint is with the spell checker, but I think that's aggravating for everyone at first. It's the first cell phone she's been able to use right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing some blog entries (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/009433.html&quot;&gt;vowe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/regarding_the_iphone_keyboard&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;) about iPhone making inroads among business users, I thought I'd report that at least this business user is happy with hers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/04/08/open-all-night/&quot;&gt;mentioned a couple of weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, starting in May we are keeping the drive-thru open 24 hours on weekends. It's now the first weekend in May, so last night was our first all-nighter. But we had a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our equipment is connected to an electricity management system, where our opening hours are programmed and the largest pieces of equipment are turned on and off automatically. We had changed the weekend hours from  &quot;7 to 4&quot; to &quot;7 to 7&quot;, but didn't notice that the change wasn't accepted. So come 4:00 this morning, first the roof lights were shut down, then the grills. Can't sell a whole lot at night if the store is dark and you can't cook any burgers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking the manual this morning, we saw that for continuous operation the times have to be entered as midnight to midnight (which to an old sys admin sounds something like the intervals in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nagios.org/&quot;&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt;). So we're confident that this evening we'll truly be open all night. fully lit and with a full selection of products available.&lt;/p&gt;

This time it was covered more thoroughly and as a bonus included an obscenity in English. I would say someone in our area has some serious brand trust issues with us, to put it in marketing terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs are rented and insured against vandalism, so such actions don't cost us any money, but they're a pain to deal with nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For our flight to Orlando this week, we looked more at price than comfort. Direct flights to Orlando were full for the dates we wanted, so we ended up choosing US Airways in coach from Frankfurt with a stop at their hub in Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard that US Airways has been having service problems since their merger with America West, so we weren't expecting any luxury. We weren't disappointed. The seats were tight on legroom, and there were charges for headsets and alcoholic beverages. Most annoying, however, was the check-in system, which separate our seats on 3 of the 6 legs, despite having reserved seats together. We weren't able to check-in online (because the Hamburg-Frankfurt leg was on a partner carrier), so we were at the mercy of the airport attendants. We were able to trade seats in the plane to sit together, but it's still a pain. Our colleagues in business class, however, were happy with their flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, our experience changing planes in Charlotte was wonderful. Customs and immigration was quick and efficient, luggage transfer was easy, walking distances from gate to gate were short, and the airport was comfortable for waiting, even when our Orlando flight was delayed for 2 hours, with plenty of shops and bars to pass the time. The central throughway is outfitted with wooden rocking chairs, for a Southern front-porch feeling which we thought was cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back, we were slightly late coming into Frankfurt and had only 45 minutes connection times. We ran from Gate C to Gate A and just made it... our luggage, however, did not, and was delivered to our home by taxi that evening. But you need to plan at least an hour for any transfer at Frankfurt, or longer if changing terminals and not just gate areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, if flying to the States with a change of planes, we advise planning the change in a smaller airport like Charlotte, and avoiding huge hubs like LaGuardia or O'Hare. Too bad the only airline flying to Charlotte is US Airways.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Open All Night</title>

&lt;p&gt;Staying open 24 hours is an idea we briefly considered but then rejected... the night traffic at our restaurant is just too light. So we close the drive-thru at 1 during the week and at 4 on weekends. But now our restaurant manager has convinced us that on weekends the potential is there, and presented us with a staffing concept to stay open all night Friday and Saturday with no additional labor costs. So we're going for it! Starting the first weekend in May, our drive-thru will stay open all night on Friday and Saturday. Even if we only break even, the advertising potential will be worth the effort&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We haven't made any progress on the house pet front, but the ongoing negotiations are encouraging. We do have some further details on why Christopher is insisting on a dalmatian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Mama: What about a beagle. They're cute and have such floppy ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Christopher: But beagles are brown. I want a dalmatian that's black and white. Black and white are my favorite colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Mama: Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Christopher: Black is in the German flag and white is in the American flag. So a dalmatian is German and American, just like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't argue with that logic.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Addition to the Family</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At 8 years old, Christopher is now the perfect age to have a pet to keep him &lt;s&gt;out of our hair&lt;/s&gt; occupied. For the past few months he's been talking about a snake, which has been gently but firmly vetoed by Mama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had cats in the past, but our last cat had a little bit too much hunting instinct for Christopher's taste and he has no interest in a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Christopher is talking about a dog. That would win over the Mama vote, and I have fond memories of the dog I had as a child. We have enough room and open space for a dog, and our nearby business means we're almost always home. Our wooden parquet floor is already all scratched all to hell, dog claws won't make it any worse. I'm slightly allergic to dogs, but that shouldn't be a problem. My experience has a child showed that the best cure is constant exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Christopher isn't talking about just any dog, he wants a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian&quot;&gt;Dalmatian&lt;/a&gt;. Why? &quot;They're so cute, and black and white are my favorite colors!&quot; (N.B. Check if Christopher has inherited my color blindness.) It's worth considering, but we need to decide whether the size, energy and personality of a Dalmatian would fit into our family, or whether a mixed-breed dog from the local shelter would be better for us. That's going to take some time, and we're not going to rush into a decision. We'll visit some animal shelters and some breeders together with Christopher, and do a lot of talking about the responsibility for all us of bringing a dog into the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PS This post is also a test whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/&quot;&gt;MarsEdit&lt;/a&gt; works with the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/&quot;&gt;Wordpress 2.5&lt;/a&gt;. Seems to work!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Twins pitcher and Minnesota native Pat Neshek has been keeping a &lt;a href=&quot;http://patneshek.com/&quot;&gt;weblog&lt;/a&gt; since he was in the minors. It's now spring training and Pat will be starting his second full year in the major leagues. The Twins now figure that Pat is well known enough to star in his own &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6pYVNxJQI&quot;&gt;TV ad&lt;/a&gt; for the team. Well, maybe he's not as well known as they thought...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pat himself &lt;a href=&quot;http://eteamz.active.com/PatNeshek/#news4228830&quot;&gt;blogged about the spot&lt;/a&gt; (but click fast, his hoster hasn't implemented permalinks), and if you're not from Minnesota you might need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=joe+mauer+sideburns&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; to get the bit about the sideburns. All of the Twins TV ads are pretty good... the best one was last year with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7G3OtU6OkQ&quot;&gt;Johan Santana/Joe Nathan carpool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor had an opportunity few brain scientists would wish for: One morning, she realized she was having a massive stroke. As it happened -- as she felt her brain functions slip away one by one, speech, movement, understanding -- she studied and remembered every moment. This is a powerful story about how our brains define us and connect us to the world and to one another.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Frauke had surgery on her right hand last week for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_Tunnel_Syndrome&quot;&gt;Carpal Tunnel Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Her arm had been bothering her for a couple of months, with numbness and pins-and-needles feeling at night. After some unsuccessful local treatments, our orthopedist sent her to a neurologist who confirmed that the median nerve was indeed being pinched and that surgery would be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our orthopedist also performed the surgery, and she's been back 3 times already for follow-up. Her right hand is still in a splint, but she was back at work the afternoon on the surgery. She says she can make a lot on add-on sales in McCaf&amp;eacute; based on sympathy. She can't drive her Touran because of the manual transmission, but has traded cars with an employee so she remains mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her hand is doing fine and is recovering on schedule. Her frustration with having to do everything left-handed is what one would expect, and we're confident that her disposition will also recover on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

It's kind of like sticking your feet in the oven when you're head is cold so that your average temperature is OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think the expression is &quot;sticking your head in the oven when your feet are cold&quot;, but that made me think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Plath#Death&quot;&gt;Sylvia Plath&lt;/a&gt;, and such a dire impression is not the one what I wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Card-carrying Communists infiltrating the inner circle of government... sounds like an accusation of the McCarthy era. But the headline comes from 2008 Germany, and the Communist in question resides in our neighbor community of Buchholz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Left Party was able to enter the state parliament in Niedersachsen election last month with 7% of the vote. Among their newly elected candidates is Christel Wegner from Buchholz, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dkp-online.de/uz/4005/s0204.htm&quot;&gt;member of the German Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; (DKP). Last week she gave a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,535606,00.html&quot;&gt;television interview&lt;/a&gt; in which she defended the East German Stasi (as useful against &quot;reactionary forces&quot;) and claimed the Berlin Wall was built to keep West Germans out of East Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Left Party is the successor (once removed) of East German SED, but says it has &lt;a href=&quot;http://die-linke.de/presse/presseerklaerungen/detail/zurueck/aktuell/artikel/vorstand-distanziert-sich-in-aller-form/&quot;&gt;&quot;learned from history&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and is trying to distance itself from Ms. Wegner, especially since the negative publicity could hurt their chances in the Hamburg election next weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the Left Party should make sure that the candidates they field have learned from history as well. By the way, their list for Hamburg also includes DKP members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 18 Feb 2008&lt;/strong&gt; Today the Left Party parliamentary faction in Niedersachsen voted to expel Christel from their ranks, and the national Left Party will consider a measure to no longer list &quot;crossover&quot; candidates from other leftist parties. Christel remains a faction-less member of the state parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The rest of the world may be celebrating Valentine's Day today, but we're so busy with the business (German joke: &quot;Selbstst&amp;auml;ndig bedeutet immer selbst und st&amp;auml;ndig&quot;) we don't really have time. But considering that we've been together since sometime around Valentine's Day in 1980 (that's so long ago, that Jimmy Carter was President and Helmut Schmidt was Chancellor), a 20 year franchise contract pales in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually we first met the November before, but the male half was too dense to notice that it could become anything permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday to Me! I turn forty-six today, and I started the day by working the closing shift in the restaurant last night, getting home at 5:30. It was a good shift despite being one closer short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also one year ago today that Frauke returned from one of her many business trips to Munich to tell that that she'd be given the opportunity to become a franchisee, and would be home a lot more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Boing Boing Gadgets mentions the upcoming LEGO Indiana Jones video game and how (like the toys) it &lt;a href=&quot;http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/02/08/lego-indiana-jones-v.html&quot;&gt;will not display Nazi symbols&lt;/a&gt;. Good thing! As I mention in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/02/08/lego-indiana-jones-v.html#comment-121962&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;, we already had to have a talk with Christopher about the Nazi symbols in the films.  He's going have to deal with German history soon enough... he should be able to have fun with LEGO without having to be confronted with the symbols already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it goes without saying that without the evil marketing geniuses at LEGO releasing toys and games in advance of the upcoming movie, Christopher wouldn't know about Indiana Jones at all, and it wouldn't be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Forgive me for not posting an update on my brother here... I mentioned his status on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/papascott&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, but most poeple would have missed that, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was released from the hospital last Tuesday, 29 January, a week after being admitted. With two stents freeing the arteries that caused the arrest, his heart should now be better off than before. If his heart were his only health problem, he could have returned to work this week... but instead he is resuming his chemotherapy this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotionally, he's still a mess, angry and frustrated with God and the world. That's understandable, I guess, but not particularly constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned home also last Tuesday after 5 days in Minnesota. Frauke was able to handle both son and business alone for a week, and things are now normal again at home. We've had an overnight meeting at Westerland for the two of us, a short school vacation and a late birthday party for Christopher, and a small sickness wave at work. In other words, more of the usual and less of the unusual.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The good news is that my brother Steve, 4 years younger than I, is now awake and is stable after suffering a cardiac arrest on Tuesday. His condition is complicated by the fact that he had just started chemotherapy for the 2nd recurrence of cancer and had just recovered from a broken ankle which had delayed his cancer diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news was that he was in the local hospital already when the arrest occurred, with what he though was serious heartburn, so he was resuscitated very quickly. He was airlifted to the regional cardiac center in St. Cloud, MN, where I am now, and placed in induced hypothermia (effectively a cold coma) to preserve brain function. Wednesday night they started to raise his temperature, and Thursday evening he opened his eyes and could respond to our voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the news at 7 am on Wednesday, and was on a plane by noon. There were plenty of seats, there aren't a lot of tourists in Minnesota in January, so the airfare was reasonable. Frauke and Christopher are doing fine on their own. My tentative return is next Wednesday, but that of course depends on, well, everythng.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Wulff Again</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/01/19/wulff-again/"/>
   <updated>2008-01-19T09:55:01+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/01/19/wulff-again</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are three regional election campaigns going on in Germany, with three CDU state presidents up for re-election: Roland Koch in Hesse, Ole von Beust in Hamburg, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.ndr.de/nachrichten/landtagswahl_niedersachsen_2008/kandidaten/wulff102.html&quot;&gt;Christian Wulff&lt;/a&gt; in our own Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We in Niedersachsen are blessed with the most boring of the three campaigns. The polls are showing a slight decline for Wulff's CDU from 5 years ago, when he was helped by an anti-Schr&amp;ouml;der backlash, but his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haz.de/newsroom/politik/zentral/politik/niedersachsen/art668,204453&quot;&gt;CDU-FDP coalition is in no danger&lt;/a&gt;. Even the question of whether the new Linke party makes it into the legislature, which is messing up the calculus in the other two states, doesn't put Wulff's coalition in any jeopardy. Wullf is well-known and well-liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenger &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.ndr.de/nachrichten/landtagswahl_niedersachsen_2008/kandidaten/juettner36.html&quot;&gt;Wolfgang J&amp;uuml;ttner&lt;/a&gt; has been a quiet party soldier in the Landtag 20 years and is not as well recognized. The SPD seems to be focussing more on their national theme of economic justice (minimum wage, etc.) than on their candidate or local issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in the media shadow from Hamburg, so we actually don't get very much news from our state capital of Hannover. Off the top of my head it's difficult to list the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.ndr.de/nachrichten/landtagswahl_niedersachsen_2008/themen/wahlndsthemen2.html&quot;&gt;main themes&lt;/a&gt; of the campaign. The top issue is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.ndr.de/nachrichten/landtagswahl_niedersachsen_2008/themen/bildung10.html&quot;&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;. The CDU is for the traditional 3-track education system, and rolled back some of the reforms started under previous SPD governments. Luckily our elementary school in Jesteburg could keep its current form, but come 5th grade for Christopher we'll have to choose between the 3 tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.ndr.de/nachrichten/landtagswahl_niedersachsen_2008/themen/umwelt6.html&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt;. Niedersachsen is the only German state with an FDP environment minister, which some think is a akin to having the fox watch the henhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of sparks as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ftd.de/politik/deutschland/:In%20Hannover%20Ehefrau/304535.html&quot;&gt;SPD mentioned Wullf's private situation&lt;/a&gt; (separated, not divorced, new partner, expecting a baby), but this is Germany, not America, and noone cares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election day is January 27, the same day as in Hesse, where Roland Koch is is making headlines and is in real danger of losing his post. The coverage from Hannover that evening will be more of a footnote... &quot;meanwhile in Niedersachsen Christian Wullf was able to stay in office with light losses&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claire at &lt;a href=&quot;http://claireseuroamerica.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Cheeseburgers and Sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt; has another &lt;a href=&quot;http://claireseuroamerica.blogspot.com/2008/01/here-we-go-again.html&quot;&gt;expat view on the Niedersachsen election&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  I am so proud to be from the state of Minnesota. We&amp;rsquo;re the workingest state in the country, and the reason why we are, we have more people that are working longer hours, we have people that are working two jobs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/01/14/democrats-abroad-global-presidential-primary</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a public service announcement for expats of the Democratic persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year for the first time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democratsabroad.org/&quot;&gt;Democrats Abroad&lt;/a&gt;, the overseas branch of the US Democratic Party, is offering the opportunity for expats to vote in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democratsabroad.org/article/2008/01/11/delegate-selection-plan-summary&quot;&gt;Global Presidential Primary&lt;/a&gt; from February 5 to 12 to elect 22 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. You can vote over the internet, by fax, by mail or in person. You do need to be a US citizen eligible to vote in the general election in November, and you can vote either in the Global Primary or your home state's primary, but not both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To vote in the Global Primary, you need to join Democrats Abroad by January 31, which you can do at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.VoteFromAbroad.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VoteFromAbroad.org&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democratsabroad.org/user/register&quot;&gt;Democrats Abroad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For equal time, there is also an organization for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.republicansabroad.org/&quot;&gt;Republicans Abroad&lt;/a&gt;. However, they are not part of the Republican National Committee, so they don't elect any delegates to the Republican National Convention. But they can certainly help you get set up to participate in the nomination process in your home state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are a Republican, in all fairness, I hope that our guy (or girl) kicks your guy's butt in November.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We didn't to be bored after our busy month in December, so we're running a coupon promotion for the next 3 weeks. These coupons are officially only valid for our restaurant, but many McDonald's in Germany are running similar promotions so you might be able to use them elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>McDonald's Takes On Starbucks</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/01/07/mcdonalds-takes-on-starbucks/"/>
   <updated>2008-01-07T20:14:04+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2008/01/07/mcdonalds-takes-on-starbucks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today's Wall Street Journal reports on McDonald's plans to &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119967000012871311.html?mod=yahoo_hs&amp;amp;ru=yahoo&quot;&gt;add coffee bars to its 14,000 US restaurants&lt;/a&gt; by the end of this year (WSJ is not yet free, but the link should work for a few days). They will be similar but not quite the same as the McCaf√©s in several hundred German McDonald's, including our restaurant in Dibbersen. It sounds like they will be putting the espresso machines behind the front counter instead of a separate shop-in-shop, in part to be able to serve all coffee products in drive-thru (German McCaf√© sells only in-store). It sounds like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beverageworld.com/content/view/34073/&quot;&gt;investment will be $100,000 per store&lt;/a&gt; (total for 14,000 stores: $1.4 billion), but with an expected sales increase of $1 billion per year, it should pay off in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the headline, I don't think Starbucks has to worry. Customers wanting the full corporate coffee lounge experience will go out of their way and pay the higher prices. I also think it's interesting that US McDonald's is taking an innovation developed outside the US. Over half of McDonald's are outside the US, and with the US market fairly saturated, the exciting markets are also overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Achieving z</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/12/31/achieving-z/"/>
   <updated>2007-12-31T10:17:27+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/12/31/achieving-z</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One month after our re-opening we're very happy with the new look and the McCaf&amp;eacute;. Our customers seem to be happy with it as well. I can't talk about numbers here, so I'll use letters instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our monthly sales started at a level of *x*, and in our business plan we estimated that after the remodel they would increase to *y*. After 3 to 5 years of hard work and good business practices we estimated we could achieve a level of *z*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of yesterday we have already achieved *z* for December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That of course does not rule out the hard work and good business practices for the future... we want *z* to be the average for all months, and not just be the best month of the year. But it's yet another sign we're moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short run, achieving *z* when your crew schedule and logistics have been planned for *y* presents problems of its own (i.e. short of crew and low on stock). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even when you've achieved *z* that doesn't mean you can rest on your laurels. There's always the next step, *z*+1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on that note... Happy New Year, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Mary and Joseph, along with an unidentified donkey. They've had a long hard journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem, but now they are just centimeters away from their goal. Christopher placed them on the kitchen table two weeks ago, and every day has moved them closer to the nativity scene near the back door. Two nights ago they were on the TV set. Today they made it on top of the radiator.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that we finally got DSL back after 10 days down, it turns out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-systems.com/tsi/en/30948/Home/LargeEnterprise/Solutions/Telecommunications/TVPN/1-TVPN&quot;&gt;T-VPN&lt;/a&gt; we are joining is a voice-service VPN, not a data VPN. I guess the Deutsche Telekom uses the term VPN differently than the rest of the world, which was confusing me (not to mention the fact that the whole transaction had to wait for our DSL line).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mcdonalds.de/html.php?t=McCaf%E9%AE&amp;amp;c=mccafe_wlan&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/wlan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wlan.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Not that a POTS (plain old telephone service) VPN isn't a cool thing, it's just not what I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also cool that our other Telekom issues at the restaurant were both resolved today. We once again have a T-Mobile HotSpot (with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcdonalds.de/html.php?t=McCaf%E9%AE&amp;amp;c=mccafe_wlan&quot;&gt;an hour free WLAN every day!&lt;/a&gt;) and we have a DSL line for our flat screen TV.&lt;/p&gt;

At work we've set the Christmas party for the end of January and are calling it a &quot;End of Year&quot; party. People seem to have more time in for Christmas parties in January anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least I got our photo cards ready for our friends and relatives in the States (as always at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usps.com/cardstore/&quot;&gt;USPS Card Store&lt;/a&gt;, where they mail the cards for us at domestic rates). Nothing new in the card if you read PapaScott regularly, but I did come up with a couple of good lines...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  After 24 years of Frauke working for McDonald's, McDonald's now works for us!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Almost sounds like a Soviet Russia joke. :-) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  (Christopher) keeps reminding us what is really important, and makes our lives a joy (even if it is sometimes a little messy).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now notice I have at least one typo in the final version of the printed card. That's the nice thing about the internet... you can always go back and correct your speling.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We finally got a confirmation from T-Systems... our DSL at home will be back up next Monday. I have no idea why a change of DSL provider requires a 6 day downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have no idea why when I try to call the Telekom business customer service hotline, I always end up talking to a household customer service representative who cannot access any data for business customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, our home office will be part of our restaurant VPN, so we'll be able to access all our restaurant data from home. It will be worth it in the end, I'm sure, but the downtime has been very annoying. In the meantime I've rigged up a tin can with a string... that is, a bluetooth connection to a cell phone with a data flatrate... so we can at least read mail and check our bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll try to be there at least for the beginning. How long I stay depends on whether Christopher comes with me or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be at the Friesensch&amp;auml;nke stand, which is directly on the left when one faces the Rathaus from the bus stop. I'll be standing next to the guy holding a mug of Gl&amp;uuml;hwein.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The past 10 days have been crazy hectic, but we can now say with 99% certainty that we will open our McCaf&amp;eacute; this Saturday. We've been handing out coupons, we've given interviews, we'll be giving a reception for press and politicians (and a few friends) next week, and we've got an ad in the local paper...&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>You Can Say You To Me</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/11/20/you-can-say-you-to-me/"/>
   <updated>2007-11-20T05:33:59+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/11/20/you-can-say-you-to-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that I've stuck my foot firmly in my mouth with regards to Ami, I'll now try to stick it in even further with a couple of more German terms, namely the second-person pronouns &quot;Du&quot; and &quot;Sie&quot;. In English we did away with the informal forms &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou&quot;&gt;&quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot;&lt;/a&gt; ages ago, but in German one still has to sort out the formal &quot;Sie&quot; and the informal &quot;Du&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we took over the restaurant we made the conscious decision to address all employees as &quot;Du&quot; and by first name and invite them to address us the same way. For one thing, we wanted to send a signal that we were going to be very involved in the restaurant and be very accessible to all employees. The staff were pretty much all &quot;duzing&quot; one another anyway, and we wanted to be included. Our own experience with &quot;Du&quot; at the workplace had been good... Frauke had always been on a first-name basis with her top-level subordinates, and I had been in the IT industry where &quot;Du&quot; is the norm. In addition, we didn't to play any favorites. In any workplace you start &quot;duzing&quot; a few employees, and you end up the appearance that some employees are more favored than others. Finally, we wanted to remove a barrier to communication... it's a lot shorter and quicker to say &quot;Frauke&quot; than &quot;Frau Petersen-Hanson&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know from experience the switch can be somewhat unnerving. After working in a traditional German office environment (well, as traditional as working mostly with expats can be), I was floored to be addressed as Du by the CEO on my first day working at an IT firm. The novelty and cuteness wears off after a few days, though, and it becomes normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results in the restaurant have been mostly positive. The new hires pick up on it right away, and the old hands after a time have gotten used to our first names, though some still use the Sie pronoun. That's OK... we're not playing IKEA and forcing everyone to say Du to one another. Interestingly, it's the foreign-born staff that has put up the most resistance. I guess after having learned Du and Sie in a new language, it's hard to shift gears. Or maybe we haven't communicated our reasons well enough.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>PapaScott On Tour (Not)</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/11/18/papascott-on-tour-not</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had really hoped to make it to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbittner.com/germany/2007/08/3rd-whiney-expat-blogger-in-germany.html&quot;&gt;Whiney Expat Blogger in Germany Meet-Up&lt;/a&gt; in Dresden this weekend. I cleared my own schedule and have the weekend off, but alas my time depends on two other schedules as well. I couldn't leave Christopher alone with Frauke on the weekend our construction starts getting serious, so we agreed that I would stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad. I haven't been to Dresden since 1995, and I'm sure a lot has changed since then. And now that they've build the A14 Autobahn between Magdeburg and Dresden, it's a lot easier to get to. Google Maps says it's a 4:20 drive, and Google forgets that Germany has no speed limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I've tried to do some extra whining on PapaScott the past few weeks to make up for my absence. And once our McCaf&amp;eacute; is up and running, maybe we can host a mini-meetup and invite some bloggers over for coffee and cake (sometime in the first half of 2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I've registered for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordcamp08.de/&quot;&gt;German WordCamp conference in Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; on January 27-28. One of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/GermanPermalinks&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; in the German WordPress distribution, so I might still have some street cred regarding WordPress. My free time is tentative, so I might have to cancel at the last minute, but by then our business should have settled down somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday as part of our remodelling we installed a new drive-thru order taking system. It features a Customer Order Display, where the guest can see his order as it is being entered into our POS. We wanted to make sure it was up and running before we close the lobby for construction next week. For 10 days we will be running with drive-thru only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one complaint at our and at any McDonald's is incorrect orders in drive-thru. This will eliminate one source of error, miscommunication between the guest and the order-taker. We also replaced the wireless system with improved sound quality for order taking. That should also reduce the number of errors and increase the speed of service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher and I tried it out last night, and we had a great experience! Frauke knew we were coming, though, and presented the order herself. Normally children do not get a kiss from their mother when receiving orders in our drive-thru, but Christopher did. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Is "Ami" an Insult?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinamr.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;American im Odenwald&lt;/a&gt; Martina wonders why an American in Germany would name a blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amiexpat.com/&quot;&gt;AmiExpat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinamr.blogspot.com/2007/11/amis.html&quot;&gt;Isn't &quot;Ami&quot; an insulting term for Americans?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never felt insulted by the term Ami, and said so in her comments. Germans are always coming up with funny shortened names for things, like Wessi, Ossi, Sozi, Fundi. Such terms are more for bar talk than everyday speech, but I've never seen any harm in them. The split in the comments seemed to be 50-50, though, between those who felt uncomfortable with the term and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm curious about it, though, so I'll ask me readers here. Is &quot;Ami&quot; a harmless term, or have I been being insulted all these years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(On the other hand, I don't like the term &quot;US-amerikanisch&quot; to describe my nationality or my language. It'd be like referring to &quot;European Germans&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've reported before that in Germany you have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/16/the-problem-with-no/&quot;&gt;say no very directly&lt;/a&gt; for it to be understood as no. I've recently discovered that the same principle can apply to &quot;yes&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in a hotel Frauke mislaid her cell phone and sent me to the reception desk to check if anyone had found it. Indeed, a cell phone had been found, and it looked very similar to Frauke's phone, and I was asked if it was her phone. I couldn't be sure, though, without opening the case, so trying to be friendly and polite I replied &quot;Yes, it could be.&quot; &lt;em&gt;(Ja, es k&amp;ouml;nnte sein.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not accepted as an affirmative reply. I forget the exact response, but it was along the lines of &quot;Well are you sure or are you not?&quot; or &quot;Is that supposed to be yes or no?&quot; I had to start over and say that Frauke's name would appear on the display when it was turned on, and that would prove whether it was her phone or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany it pays to be sure of yourself, even when you're not. Arrogance here is not a negative attribute, but rather a prerequisite. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Didn't You Park There?</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/11/09/why-didnt-you-park-there/"/>
   <updated>2007-11-09T13:37:32+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/11/09/why-didnt-you-park-there</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is yet another episode in the ongoing series &quot;Germans are Strange and Wonderful Creatures&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a particularly hard week of night shifts, I needed to get to the bank on Wednesday morning. Our bank has the proverbial &quot;bankers' hours&quot;, they're closed on Wednesday afternoons. Wednesday is also market day in Buchholz, and the rare parking spaces downtown are even harder to find than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this particular Wednesday I had been trolling for a parking spot for nearly 15 minutes without any success. At our local Famila market I finally spotted a space, but it was very tight and I decided not to risk it. The lady behind me pulled in, I drove on and found a better spot further up that was actually closer to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was gathering my stuff together when someone tapped on my window. It was the lady who was driving me. She was wondering why I passed by a perfectly good parking space. I was flabbergasted. She was very nice about it, but what business was it of hers or anybody else where I chose to park or not to park my car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on it, this was a typical case of German arrogance and their inborn compulsion to point out other people's mistakes. This compulsion is especially evident in situations involving cars and driving. Never mind that my behavior was completely logical, for her it was a mistake. And even though she was very nice and polite, she was compelled to go out of her way and tell me about it. She couldn't help herself. She's German, and it's in her blood.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Time Is It?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/11/07/what-if-you-get-stopped/&quot;&gt;entry yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, here is yet another in the ongoing series &quot;Germans are Strange and Wonderful Creatures&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days ago Europe switched back from Daylight Savings to Standard Time, turning the clocks back one hour on Sunday morning at 3 am. Our McDrive is open until 4 am on weekends, and we made the decision not to stay open an extra hour for the time change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had night shift that night, and I closed at 4 am DST as planned. Twenty minutes later a very angry guest pounded on our drive-thru window. It was 3:20, we should be open, and why wouldn't we serve him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with arrogant Germans, technically he was correct. Standard Time was in effect, the time was 3:20 am. However, it's my business and I can open and close the doors when I damn well please. I shouted politely but firmly through the closed window that we were closed, and that if he did not leave the premises in 5 minutes I would call the cops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The angry guest then left. Being a know-it-all German means that you can often be smug about being correct, but it usually doesn't make things any better. He was still hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What If You Get Stopped?</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/11/07/what-if-you-get-stopped</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I left my wallet at home when I drove to work. At 5 am, I'm lucky to remember anything on my way out. Unfortunately, I didn't notice my wallet was missing until after work and I had just filled my tank at the Aral gas station across the street from the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I had of value to leave as a deposit was my car registration. The woman behind the counter didn't want to take it at first... what if I got stopped by the police, I would need my registration. I talked her into it, as I had nothing else to offer, and she let me return 30 minutes later with EC card to pay for my diesel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her concern was typically German and actually pretty silly. If I would really have been stopped, having a stolen tank of gas and no driver's license would have interested the police much more the missing registration. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've started exterior construction. We're expanding the lobby in three directions. The restaurant is fully open, but the patio and PlayLand are (obviously) closed. Interior remodeling is set to begin in two weeks. The McDrive will remain open during the remodeling, but the lobby will be closed. Re-opening with McCaf&amp;eacute; is scheduled for the beginning of December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure which was more scary... the pumpkin (Christopher's own design... the features are deliberately out of kilter),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/1809235113&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0307.JPG' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2119/1809235113_99d48f22d8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0307.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or the costume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our big pumpkin turned out to be a huge gourd, nearly solid inside. It was difficult to carve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had a craft corner for Halloween at the restaurant, where kids could create their own lantern or masks, or just draw and hang out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prepare for our McCaf&amp;eacute; opening the first week of December, we placed an ad in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kreiszeitung-wochenblatt.de/&quot;&gt;Nordheide Wochenblatt&lt;/a&gt;, our local weekly paper. We're looking for help for both the McCaf&amp;eacute; and the restaurant, so the ad is not specific for either. In the first 24 hours we've already gotten a number of online applications. (This graphic includes a slight error... we're looking for several &quot;motivated employees&quot;, not just one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also ordered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/2007/10/25/unser-team-sucht-motivierte-mitarbeiter&quot;&gt;color recruitment poster&lt;/a&gt; which we'll be posting in our lobby this week.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;WHen Mama and Christopher came home from Legoland last night, his first words to me were &quot;Papa, you're gong to be upset with me!&quot; I knew he'd be coming in with an oversized and overpriced Lego toy...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, he had an Imperial Star Destroyer from the Star Wars collection (Nico, that's item number &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Product.aspx?p=6211&amp;amp;cn=240&quot;&gt;6211&lt;/a&gt; if you want one for yourself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/1758049024&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0288.JPG' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2028/1758049024_c172008932.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0288.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher muttered something about a reduced price of &quot;800&quot; (I hope he meant Danish Crowns and not Euros!), and that he'd be getting no allowance for 10 months to pay it off. I'm not sure, though, whether incurring long-term debt really enhances the pedagogical effect of giving children a weekly allowance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I'm just jealous. All I got was a key ring. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/10/25/define-crisis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Which of the following explanations would you choose to define the term &quot;milk crisis&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. There's not a single drop of milk in the house... the baby's going to starve is we don't... buy... milk.. RIGHT... NOW!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. There are actually 3 liters of milk in the fridge, but since the shops are closed tomorrow, we might run out on Monday if someone happens to go on a latte macchiato binge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously one of the many areas of disagreement in our marriage. As our ships passed in the night between shifts last Saturday, Frauke informed me that we had a &quot;milk crisis&quot; at home. I thought of Definition 1 (sans baby), and stocked up with 8 liters. She was actually referring to Definition 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, a few days later we will soon be facing a &quot;sour milk crisis&quot;, the definition of which I will leave to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Married Or Not, Here We Come...</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/10/23/married-or-not-here-we-come</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes getting married in Vegas isn't all it's advertised to be, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://halrager.org/WordPress/2007/10/23/so-are-they-married-or-not/&quot;&gt;Hal, our correspondent in Vegas&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sun/2007/oct/22/566682886.html&quot;&gt;Were they really married? Couples have cause to doubt&lt;/a&gt; [LV Sun]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  As far as Kimberly Shirak of Ypsilanti, Mich., is concerned, she and her husband of six months are married - really, truly, legally married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  And to prove it, she&amp;rsquo;s got a marriage certificate from Las Vegas&amp;rsquo; Garden of Love, photos of family members and an Elvis impersonator, and the signature of an official witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Problem is, the witness - the chapel&amp;rsquo;s co-owner - was about 1,000 miles away at the time of the April 7 nuptials, watching an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  So, back to the big question: Does that mean Shirak is or isn&amp;rsquo;t married?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may not have gotten married in Vegas, but on the eve of our silver anniversary (we're still undecided as to whether we'll throw a grand party or silently slink out of the country for the weekend... right now, we're leaning toward the latter) it's probably worth looking at the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At our courthouse ceremony in Minneapolis in 1983, we never actually paid the judge. She went on to Minnesota Court of Appeals, so it didn't seem to hurt her career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our original marriage certificate is defaced. Frauke is named on the certificate as &quot;Frauke (NMN) Petersen&quot; (NMN = no middle name), which she took that as a grave insult, and blotted out the &quot;(NMN)&quot; with a quart of Liquid Paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our German ceremony in 1985 was church-only, which in Germany counts for nothing. If you're not at a &lt;em&gt;Standesamt&lt;/em&gt;, it doesn't count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we moved to Germany in 1990, our American marriage certificate was initially not accepted by the Germany authorities... not because of the suspicious white blotch in the middle of the bride's name, but because the certificate did not have a number. The office in Kiel sent it off to the central &lt;em&gt;Standesamt&lt;/em&gt; in Berlin, and 6 weeks later it was accepted, but with a long explanatory remark in our German &lt;em&gt;Familienbuch&lt;/em&gt; certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we each kept our last names when we married in the States, which is not allowed in Germany, most people in Germany assumed we were not married when we were introduced with separate last names. (Frauke has since added a hyphenated &quot;-Hanson&quot; to her name, not for my sake, but for Christopher's).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, after 24 years, I don't think either of us has any interest in refuting the assumption that in spite of any and all doubts, we are truly married. Particularly with Frauke's career and financial success, the fact that we've had a joint bank account all these years would make a disentanglement of our affairs complicated and (for her) expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, our bank just sent out updated EC cards for our personal account... and my card came addressed to her. Should I be worried?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Seventeen and Pregnant</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/10/16/seventeen-and-pregnant</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week we're taking a break from our usual routine for me to attend (along with our trainee) the McDonald's &quot;Shift Management Course&quot; in Hamburg. For one thing I get to relive the rush-hour commute (with a possible rail strike on Thursday, yippee!), while Frauke gets to work a week of night shifts so she has afternoons free when Christopher comes home from school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the equivalent course for shift management back in 1991, but I've been away too long so I need to start from scratch. There's actually very little McDonald's-specific material in the course, it's mostly about communication and leadership. Today we had a session on employment law, so now I know such things as how long a 17-year-old pregnant (in the 5th month) employee can work each day, as well as when and how long she is required to take a break. Anyone care to guess?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's a problem you won't see at Web 2.0 startups. Our bank charges us for buying coins. The price is 20 cents per roll, regardless of denomination. A roll of 25 2-Euro coins costs the same as a roll of 50 1-cent coins. We don't get credit for rolls of coin we bring in. Of course the coins we use most are the 1-cent coins. At 20 cents per 50-cent roll, that's a good profit margin... for the bank, not us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely, we always have to buy 1-cent and 1-Euro coins, but we always have a surplus of 2-cent and 2-Euro coins.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Broken Window</title>

&lt;p&gt;The October 3rd holiday was good for the restaurant (it was like an extra weekend in the middle of the week), but it wasn't so good for our indoor playland. A child kicked out one of the clear plastic panels, and we had to close it down for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035717986@N01/1488329212&quot; title=&quot;View 'CIMG0262' on Flickr.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1146/1488329212_4bfd845225.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0262&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be getting rid of the playland when we remodel next month (we need the room for more seats), so it's not worth the bother to properly repair. As I was leaving yesterday, a carpenter was putting in a round wooden panel so that we could let kids back into the plastic box.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't have time to track down the problem, I simply restored the last backup dump (which I mail to myself daily), which of course had character set issues (mixed latin1 and utf8 characters). But now we're running pure UTF-8 on MySQL 5.0, and everything should be fine until I have to restore from backup again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're home from our meetings, which was indeed on board the AIDAaura cruise ship which was chartered for the occasion. We sailed a circle from Palma de Mallorca to Cannes and Barcelona, then back to Palma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our shore leaves we chose to take mountain bike tours. Here I am yesterday in front of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau_Nacional&quot;&gt;Palau Nacional&lt;/a&gt; in Barcelona. I'm smiling only because I don't realize that we're not even half way to the Montju&amp;iuml;c castle. I later learned that sane people take a cable car to the castle rather than a mountain bike.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've finally got a couple of current entries on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/&quot;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; for the restaurant, so it looks almost weblog-like, and we finally have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-nordheide.de/restaurant/&quot;&gt;a satellite image&lt;/a&gt; from Google Maps. The toughest part was figuring out how to customize the icon without it getting squished (hint: the graphic file has to be square, since it gets reduced to 32x32 pixels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=http:%2F%2Fwww.mcdonalds-nordheide.de%2Fdibbersen.kml&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;om=1&amp;amp;ll=53.363659,9.873147&amp;amp;spn=0.004411,0.006115&amp;amp;output=embed&amp;amp;s=AARTsJqRZMO0jq3pcJpadIZk0lcRnLZw3Q&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I forgot to say that I'm using the relatively new &lt;a href=&quot;http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/08/youtube-style-embeddable-maps_21.html&quot;&gt;embedded map feature&lt;/a&gt; of Google Maps, where similar to YouTube you can generate some HTML directly in Google Maps without having to mess with the API. To use a custom icon you need a load a &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/&quot;&gt;KML file&lt;/a&gt; into Google Maps that references an URL for the icon. It seems easiest to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://earth.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Earth&lt;/a&gt; to create the KML file than to try to create it from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was just directed to make the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/09/young-dumb-and-excited/&quot;&gt;same blog posting&lt;/a&gt;* that I make every year on this date (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/10/23rd-anniversary/&quot;&gt;close to it&lt;/a&gt;). Ok, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let it be known that I gave my wife &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulaner.de/home.html&quot;&gt;20 beautiful flowers&lt;/a&gt; from a meadow &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest&quot;&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Wiesn&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; in Munich. I would have bought 24, but the 0.5 liter bottles came only in a case of 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#42;The bride now requests that the posting from 2002 be corrected from &quot;she arrived in July, with ... nothing in her pocket&quot; to &quot;she arrived in July, with ... just $2000 in her pocket&quot; (earned by delivering the Sunday papers &lt;em&gt;Bild am Sonntag&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Welt am Sonntag&lt;/em&gt;). It doesn't make any difference, by September the money was spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, since *Hebeanlage* is a sewage pump, you can probably imagine what happens, and don't particularly want to know any details. So I'll just say that it was, and it did. And it's fixed, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't really want to create a form from scratch, but after some searching I found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dagondesign.com/articles/secure-form-mailer-plugin-for-wordpress/&quot;&gt;Secure Form Mailer Plugin For Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; that let me create an arbitrary form and insert it into a WordPress page. It's functional, but I need to optimize the layout and add some explanatory text. Our plan is then to print our URL on our receipts so our customers know we're on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texting is another hurdle. I don't feel comfortable writing text in German... not just out of concerns for spelling and grammar, but because my sentences would not be natural. I'm not sure if Frauke wants to take the time to write text herself, so I'm not sure what we'll end up doing. (Hmm, I just realized &quot;texting&quot; as a verb is a Germanism and not proper English, so maybe my English text is suspect as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine our start page being a type of weblog with current events and promotions (something like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/08/31/big-mac-pulling/&quot;&gt;Big Mac Pulling&lt;/a&gt; entry I posted here). A homepage for us is a nice-to-have, certainly not a must-have. Our target audience live within 15 km of the restaurant, and there are other ways we can reach them. However, I can imagine various ways we can encourage people to check our homepage regularly, with online coupons perhaps, with an RSS feed or updates on Twitter. Once our McCaf√® is running (we're now waiting for the building permit, projected grand opening on 6 December) we'll start a promotions offensive, and you'll hear all about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcc-nordheide.de/&quot;&gt;Mini-Car-Club Nordheide&lt;/a&gt; asked us if we'd like to sponsor an event on the vacant lot next to our restaurant. The idea was so wild we just had to say yes... a pulling contest for remote-controlled models (1:5/1:6) featuring a 60 cm replica of a Big Mac with up to 22 kg. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigmac-pulling.de/&quot;&gt;Big Mac Pulling&lt;/a&gt; will take place on Sunday, September 30, 9:00 to 18:00. Buchholz has Sunday shopping on that day as well, so those not interested in cars and dirt will have something to do as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher's homemade Berliner. All the goodness of a bakery Berliner without being cooked in lard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 &quot;normal&quot; &lt;em&gt;Br√∂tchen&lt;/em&gt; (known in these parts as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rundst%C3%BCck&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rundst√ºck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strawberry jam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powdered sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bore a hole in the &lt;em&gt;Br√∂tchen&lt;/em&gt; with the kitchen utensil of your choice. Fill with jam, and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Enjoy, but please wipe up the powdered sugar from the table when you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're still busy at the restaurant covering management shifts for vacations. The end is in sight. The last assistant just started his vacation, and by September we'll be back to full strength. We'll also have a couple people who can cover a couple of hours between shifts, so we won't need to cover every minute of every day with a salaried manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vattenfall-cyclassics.de/&quot;&gt;Vattenfall Cyclassics&lt;/a&gt; bicycle race went by our restaurant yesterday, with the highway closed at our intersection the entire morning. We didn't know if it would be a boom or a bust. It turned out to be a bust. The road was closed well in front of the restaurant, no cars could reach us, and our noon business was basically nothing. During school vacation business has been pretty unpredictable. We're looking forward to school starting again in two weeks so that both we and our customers have regular schedules again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Alarm Alarm</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/08/13/alarm-alarm/"/>
   <updated>2007-08-13T01:08:41+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/08/13/alarm-alarm</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The boss changed a few things at the restaurant while Christopher and I were gone, and one of them was a new alarm system. The system had some startup glitches, but the repairman was there on Saturday to fix a broken sensor. Since I had the late shift on Saturday as my first day back, I was the lucky one to see if the system now worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still a little groggy from jet lag when I came in last night, but I got a chip and the general instructions to activate the system (push star, wave the chip, push star again). If the green light comes on, the system is activated. If not, I have to double check all the doors and try again. OK, I think I got it. I go through the late shift, we come out at 5:15 am, and I do the star-chip-star thing. The green light blinks a few times and goes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the alarm now active or not? I have no idea. I now wish I had been a little bit more attentive, for example whether the light was supposed to blink or stay on, and especially the part about deactivating the alarm. The phone number for the alarm company is in the store, I don't have it on me. If I go in and the alarm is active, lights and sirens go off and the police are on their way. Since I'm married to the boss, I decide to take the easy way out. I go home and wake her up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's not thrilled, of course, but she calls in and sure enough, the alarm is not active. I go in again, check all the doors, and try again. Same thing happens. By now it's 6:15 am, the opening manager is going to be there in an hour anyway, and I decide to give up and go home to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not satisfactory for Frauke... she now has no idea whether the alarm system is still broken or whether her husband is just too dumb to use it. Or maybe noone told him that there is a status monitor in the office to check whether all the doors are locked. It turns out the door to the utility room (a separate room only accessible from outside) is unlocked. During the day it had been opened for, irony of ironies, the repairman from the alarm company. Once that door was locked, Frauke was able to activate the alarm... then she had to deactivate it again right away, since the opening manager had already arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course there's no indication from the outside whether the alarm is active or not... otherwise any thief could check the system himself before trying to break in. The trick is that a buzzer sounds if the activation was successful. Tonight I had night shift again... and this time the alarm worked. Don't say I'm not capable of learning from my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vacation Over</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/08/11/vacation-over</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher and I arrived home yesterday after two weeks in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* I only gained two pounds after two weeks of American food and relative inactivity. I was thrilled to be able to buy size 36 pants from Lands End after years of wearing size 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* We managed to need only the same two suitcases for the flight back that we brought with us... one for toys (mostly Lego), one for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Christopher seemed to think that vacation meant also a vacation from changing clothes... including underwear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* I got to try out the new 20 inch iMac the day after they were announced. It's nice, but my boss would never let me buy one. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Flying Icelandair from Frankfurt to Minneapolis was as pleasant as expected (no frills, but easy stopover at Keflavik). We both were even able to sleep some. Making the connection in Frankfurt was somewhat problematic, though. I would say getting from Terminal 1A to 2E in Frankfurt through construction with full luggage and a 7 year old qualifies as a level of Hell in Dante's Inferno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Flying an overbooked and late Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Hamburg full of annoyed business people would also qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* We didn't go anywhere near the 35W bridge while in the Twin Cities, but our flight flew right over with an excellent view from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* I get to work late shift tonight, just one day after flying in. I can't say I'm real excited about that, although with jet lag my personal clock is running late anyway. Frauke is taking the weekend off... her first days off since we took over in Dibbersen on July 1. I'll be working night shifts for the rest of Christopher's school vacation. That simplifies child care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the duty-free shop at Keflavik airport, I found an Iceland sweater with a unique new technology that warms from both the inside and the outside simultaneously. It was a deal I could not resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what the inside looks like. The label says something about &quot;black death&quot;. I hope we won't be regretting my purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/08/07/coming-home-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While Christopher and I are both enjoying our time in Minnesota, we're both ready to fly home on Thursday. Two weeks is more than long enough for our family to split on two continents. And given all the flight delays this summer on US carriers, I'm glad we're taking Icelandair directly out of MSP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 35W bridge collapse continues to dominate both the local and the national news, even though there has been no real news from the site since the morning after the collapse. We left Minneapolis in 1989, and the stories coming out of the collapse have been interesting to see how the city has changed (the many immigrants among the victims)... and how it has stayed the same (the incredible willingness of total strangers to help). &lt;a href=&quot;http://davespicks.com/archive/2007/08/03.html&quot;&gt;As DaveP says&lt;/a&gt;, one disturbing thing is how quickly the authorities took complete control of the surrounding area... until yesterday there was no place for the public to view the site for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be heading to Minneapolis a day early so we can rest up before our flight. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waterparkofamerica.com/&quot;&gt;water park&lt;/a&gt; near the Mall of America where we can deposit Christopher. Our suitcases are already full, so there's no room for goodies from the Lego or the Apple stores. That's probably a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just to let everyone know that we were not in Minneapolis or in the Twin Cities yesterday, so we are not affected by the bridge collapse on Interstate 35W (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID7216112_TYP_THE_NAV_REF3,00.html&quot;&gt;Tagesschau report&lt;/a&gt;) yesterday. No family or friends of ours would be normally commuting on that highway during evening rush hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I know the bridge and the neighborhood well. It crosses the Mississippi between downtown Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota, and I lived near the bridge in Southeast Minneapolis my first two years in college. &lt;a href=&quot;http://davespicks.com/&quot;&gt;Blogger DaveP&lt;/a&gt; lives in that neighborhood today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minneapolis like Hamburg is a city built on a river. You cross bridges over the river every day without giving it a second thought, taking it for granted. Thank God that due to road maintenance, only one lane was open on the bridge in each direction. It could have been a lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greetings from Lake Minnewaska! Whoever has the WiFi still has it turned on, so I have Internet as long as I sit outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather is pretty much perfect.... 85¬∞ and clear. Christopher gets a whole hide-a-bed to himself, so he likes that. It's Waterama weekend, so Glenwood is full. We found a swim mask and snorkel on special for $7, so Christopher can now explore the bottom of the lake. He found 6 golf balls at the end of the dock.... Grandma thinks an angry wife must have dumped them there. The hot water heater is burned out, so no hot showers until we can pick up a part on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher wants to go to the indoor &quot;swim park with the donuts&quot; (i.e. waterslide with inner tubes) Alexandria, we'll try to wait until we have a rainy or a hot day. Turns out he packed only one pair of socks, so we might have to go back to Target to buy essential clothes (and a camera I'm looking at) while we're there. We have 3 baseball tickets for next Saturday afternoon (Twins and the Indians) for us and Uncle Steve, we'll have to make a special trip to the Cities for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandpa is doing well. He looks better than I had expected. I think Christopher was a good motivation for him to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish you were here! The espresso pot makes too much for one person alone. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tostedt HRB 200842</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It took over 8 weeks, but as of yesterday Frauke's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmbh&quot;&gt;GmbH&lt;/a&gt; is finally registered with the local court in Tostedt. (GmbH is short for &lt;em&gt;Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung&lt;/em&gt;, literally &quot;company with limited liability&quot;, a form of incorporation common in Germany.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically the formation of a GmbH takes only a week, but the papers returned twice (or was it three times) by the court to our notary for minor errors. We had become extremely annoyed by the entire process, and finally yesterday Frauke personally went to the court yesterday to finalize the process. We absolutely needed the HRB number now in order to register and get plates for her company car, which is being delivered today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of papers has also complicated our dealings with the bank and the Finanzamt (not only for our own taxes, but for VAT and withholding taxes from wages), and not least delayed the formal purchase contract for the restaurant. We finally be able to get all these affairs settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A GmbH is a matter of public record, so you can go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.handelsregister.de/&quot;&gt;http://www.handelsregister.de/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/mask.do?Typ=n&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; for Registernummer 200842 at Registergericht Tostedt, and see the details for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Minus Five</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/07/15/minus-five/"/>
   <updated>2007-07-15T20:21:45+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/07/15/minus-five</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After two weeks getting reacquainted with restaurant work, on Friday afternoon I had my first long shift alone, the mid-shift from 1 to 9 pm. Fridays are extra challenging since the dinner hours are (along with Sunday evenings) the busiest hours of the week, and the closing shift doesn't come in until 8:30 pm because of the longer hours on weekends. This particular Friday we had back luck with crew calling in sick. We actually had two people less for dinner rush than for the mid-afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on this particular Friday was the first school vacation weekend in Hamburg, Harley Days in Hamburg, and the first good weather in two weeks. Between 6 and 8 pm it was like getting rolled over with a steam roller. We literally had lines out the door, and I could only open 2 registers. The customers were patient and good natured, but we could have done a lot more business. Thanks to the good weather, most of them sat outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for us, most of our closers came early and punched in a quarter to eight. We then had 2 more registers, and could send 2 people to the lobby. Checking our hourly sales, we just missed our projection from 7 to 8 pm, but the PC said we had 4.5 too few crew. Considering that 4 people punched in at 7:45 pm, we were then at least five people short before they arrived. We had 9 plus me, we should have had 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/&quot;&gt;Nico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sibylle.blogg.de/&quot;&gt;Sibylle&lt;/a&gt; and family came in about 7:45 pm, just as things were starting to settle down. Other than the question &quot;Is it always this full?&quot; they seemed pleased with the service, and Frauke said that &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3514&quot;&gt;the picture Nico took of me&lt;/a&gt; &quot;doesn't look all that bad&quot; considering the previous two hours. Sibylle noted that the child seats don't have straps and it is too easy for an active toddler like &lt;a href=&quot;http://sibylle.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=490&quot;&gt;Henri&lt;/a&gt; to crawl out. I'll pass that along to the boss. And maybe we can do a guided tour next time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Google Saved Our Morning Coffee</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/07/14/google-saved-our-morning-coffee/"/>
   <updated>2007-07-14T21:15:24+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/07/14/google-saved-our-morning-coffee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever, our morning coffee is a vital necessity in order to start the day. So it was with no small amount of horror that we discovered yesterday that our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/24/jura-xf50/&quot;&gt;Jura coffee machine&lt;/a&gt; would no longer produce coffee. The beans would grind, the water would pump, but only a few drops of hot brown elixir would trickle into our cups. No error message was displayed, and the problem persisted even after changing the water filter and running the cleaning program twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Google to the rescue. Searching for &quot;Jura selbst reparieren&quot; (repair Jura yourself) brought up the site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomess.de/jura/index.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Selber schrauben an Jura&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, where we found that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biomess.de/jura/html/faq.html&quot;&gt;common problem&lt;/a&gt; (FAQ 15) is that the brew filter becomes clogged. It can be easily cleaned with your finger after reaching with your hand through the tray opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if Google would only brew the coffee for us every morning as well, it would be almost worth all the private data they are collecting from us.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ten Days In</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/07/11/ten-days-in/"/>
   <updated>2007-07-11T20:24:47+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/07/11/ten-days-in</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the relative silence here. Sixty-hour work weeks (40+ in the store plus office work at home) put a real crimp in your blogging. I can't really complain to my boss, though, she's working even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very happy with the first 10 days. We took over a wonderful crew and management team that is intelligent and motivated. We're investing our crew labor costs by increasing staffing on all shifts, and we're already seeing above-market sales increases. If you staff it, they will come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been able to add 5 new employees to our crew of 39, but we need more (we're losing some crew when the new school year and apprenticeship terms start in August). And we need to start adding employees now for the sales increases we expect with McCaf√© in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, what's new for us is that we need to coordinate our home life with Christopher. Once or twice a week we can bring him for a &quot;shift&quot; at the restaurant for an hour or two, but no more than that. Since I've worked home office the past 3 years, we have to readjust to the same problems all working parents face. For his part, Christopher has been very good about the sudden change in our routine. He's very excited about summer school vacation and our (his and mine) visit to Grandma and Grandpa in Minnesota in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're still way too busy to catch our breaths, but I thought I'd show the &quot;directional&quot; sign we've commissioned. You'll see this when you drive into Buchholz on the L√ºneburger Strasse, from Jesteburg. Since the McCaf√© won't be ready for a few months, we'll paste a &quot;Coming in December&quot; sticker over the McCaf√© logo. Hopefully it will raise some curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we'll see the sign every day when we drive to work, it will also serve as a quick shot of daily motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we got home at 3:30 this morning, Christopher insisted on going to the restaurant at 9:00 am for his first day of &quot;work&quot;. We were actually already awake, I guess we can catch up on sleep later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I thought it was funny that we'd have only one car for 24 hours (Frauke will borrow her mother's car until her Touran arrives). Not anymore. This morning as Frauke wanted to drive to the bakery, the Lupo refused to start. The engine catches, but when we release the key it cuts out after 1 or 2 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now waiting for the tow truck from our VW garage to arrive and to arrange a loaner car. This certainly puts a kink in our plans for today. :-(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Just as I was to post this entry, the tow truck arrived with the loaner car on board. Our business has been saved!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally have some time to answer some questions from the audience. I'll start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/06/26/100-hours/#comment-34515&quot;&gt;DaveP&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Are you going to have McBier?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant currently does sell beer (Bitburger in bottles), but we will be dropping it. Beer is a standard menu item in Germany, but it's a very low seller. We'd only sell 3 or 4 each day. The permit to sell beer costs ¬Ä960 per year, so we didn't have to think very hard to decide that it was not worth it. Instead we will offer alcohol-free beer, which fits in better with the image we want to present anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an Aral gas station across the street, and anyone who really wants beer would go there in the first place. They have better selection and don't pour the beer into a paper cup.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're now less than 100 hours away from owning a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked 2 closing shifts over the weekend (until 5 and 3 am), then back at 11:30 on Monday (yes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/06/22/training-day/#comment-34506&quot;&gt;DaveP&lt;/a&gt;, I have good shoes, from Ecco). Today I feel like I have transatlantic jet lag. But I know the layout of the store now and have met most of the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten it was &lt;em&gt;Schutzenfest&lt;/em&gt; this weekend. After getting to bed at 5:30 Sunday morning, I was awakened at 7:30 by a marching band coming to honor the &lt;em&gt;Ehrenk√∂nig&lt;/em&gt; next door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been busy checking and copying personnel files for our accountant to make sure we're ready for our first payroll at the end of July. Frauke also has to write employment contracts for the two of us, since legally we will be employees of the GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we took an initial equipment walkthrough with representatives of McDonald's, noting the condition of all equipment from top (roof A/C units) to bottom, inside and out. It didn't rain much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GmbH still isn't legal. A paragraph in the papers had to be changed, and the court in Tostedt seems to be in no hurry to approve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the stress and the return to physical work, I've lost 4 kg the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;T-minus 8 days. The outgoing manager at our soon-to-be restaurant was gracious enough to allow me to work a few shifts behind the counter before we take over (with no monetary compensation, of course). I've been concentrating on the kitchen, since that's where the most changes have taken place since 1994, when I last ran a shift at a restaurant. I won't be running shifts full time, since my main priority is still a little boy who's about to finish the first grade, but I can fill in for late shifts during the week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two days I can say the changes in the kitchen are all for the better (especially being able to see orders as they are being placed), but after over a decade of desk work, I'm going to have to get used to being on my feet all day. Oh, my dogs are tired!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Censr at Flickr</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/06/20/censr-at-flickr/"/>
   <updated>2007-06-20T05:32:48+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/06/20/censr-at-flickr</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had my head down in work the past few days, with the old job winding down and the new business starting up. So at first I missed the shitstorm stirred up when Flickr (now owned by Yahoo!) added a German interface, and at the same time forced German users (along with those in Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea) to use SafeSearch, i.e. German users can now only view content considered safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/fab1an/544754915/&quot; title=&quot;bloggbox: Zensur!&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1157/544754915_28c462d9a1_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bloggbox: Zensur!&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;German Flickr users were livid about the change, and the more so while it was first unexplained, then a couple of days later jusified with a vague &quot;to comply with German law&quot;. Finally a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/42597/page16/#reply230304&quot;&gt;reply from Heather Champ&lt;/a&gt; at Flickr revealed that &quot;The central problem is that Germany has much more stringent age verification laws than its neighboring countries and specifies much harsher penalties, including jail time, for those with direct responsibility...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/004208.shtml&quot;&gt;Heiko correctly points out&lt;/a&gt;, this isn't really censorship. Only governments can censor. Companies control access to their content however they want. But the photos on Flickr do not belong to Flickr or to Yahoo!, but to their users. Yahoo! chose to listen to their lawyers without even talking to their users (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nicozorn.com/2007/06/18/flickr-dann-loesch-doch-deinen-account/&quot;&gt;and they still aren't&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.burningbird.net/&quot;&gt;Shelley&lt;/a&gt; always warned that with such services, when push comes to shove, the users will get the short end. Now we have a concrete example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting on another level. Despite the global reach of the internet, even a global web company can trip over national customs and standards. For one thing, even though German law can be construed to imply that a online photo service faces criminal liability for their content, but in practice it has never happened. For another, given their historical experience with fascism, Germans are extremely sensitive to anything that reeks of control or censorship. And most Germans would consider American standards for decency and pornography to be absurd. Finally, German web sites use a standard for age-control that could easily be applied at Flickr, if necessary. It's called a credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Flickr and Yahoo! have proven themselves unreliable and unworthy of storing personal content, and German bloggers are leaving Flickr in droves. I, too, will be moving my photos elsewhere. Perhaps I will follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://sprechblase.wordpress.com/2007/06/17/23/&quot;&gt;Cem's advice&lt;/a&gt; and try out the Danish service &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.23hq.com/&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/5205-14-Kunden.html&quot;&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/5208-gaehn.html&quot;&gt;through&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/5214-Bilanz-der-ersten-Nachtoeffnung.html&quot;&gt;night&lt;/a&gt; his &quot;first night out&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course for restaurants 24 hour opening is nothing new or special. We are already open until 3 am (4 am on weekends). We're considering going 24 hours ourselves (at least in the Drive-Thru), not so much for the sales as for daily maintenance and security. There's always something to clean.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife's family decided a few years ago to combine all their birthday celebrations into 3 combined gatherings. All birthdays are pretty much clustered in November, February and May/June. So November we go to her older brother, in February to her younger brother, and in June they all come to us. That day is today, and we will have 14 guests in Chateau L√ºllau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always plan an outdoor celebration, but our party is invariably on the coldest and wettest day of the summer. We're used to putting on sweaters and grilling in the carport. We may have better luck today... the temperature will be cool (18¬∞C) rather than cold, and the showers will be scattered (rather than intense like the past couple of days). Since we have been occupied by other things the past few weeks, we didn't really start preparing until yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we have a new complication... Christopher came down with the stomach flu overnight, and is still feeling tough this morning. He's generally very healthy, he hasn't been sick for a year and a half. But now we have a child to comfort and extra loads of laundry along with the other preparations. It will be a long day... hopefully we can have *some* fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've grown weary of the whole American obsession with race, and I've gotten in the habit of ticking &quot;other&quot; when filling out forms that ask for my race (or, if I'm feeling ornery, writing in &quot;none of your business&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my name does not appear in the contract or in the papers for the GmbH, I could only watch as Frauke initialed and signed all the pages.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We got the money... and the papers, both yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our financing came through yesterday. The rate is pretty much the same as the first offer, but the small print is better (repayment begins later, less insurance required). Best of all, the extra funds for the Gym &amp;amp; Fun are included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got the notarized documents for the GmbH yesterday, which means we can register as a business *(Gewerbe)* with the city and start acting like a business, for example, open a bank account and start paying bills with company funds instead of our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we've gotten some rejections from employees who don't want to continue with us when we take over, so we're going to be a little short staffed for the first month. We've already interviewed a trainee we'd like to hire, and we'd love to hire a couple of *Azubis* (apprentices... in Germany gastronomy is a recognized trade) to start in August. In the meantime Frauke and I will be spending a lot of time in the restaurant. She's pencilled herself in for 32 shifts in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made all the preparations on Saturday. We had to buy the cardboard, a tube of yellow paint, and a artist's palette. And since Mama has offices both at home and at work, he had to of course create two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/540319732/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1400/540319732_673b10e89d.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_2063&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Frauke found an an interview &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.focus.de/finanzen/news/starbucks_aid_57627.html&quot; title=&quot;Der Blueberry-Herkules&quot;&gt;&quot;Der Blueberry-Herkules&quot;&lt;/a&gt; at focus.de with Martin Coles, President of Starbucks Coffee International, on Starbucks slow entry into the German market...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Germany is a great market for us. All of our coffee houses are profitable. We sell a premium product, and the guests are willing to pay the appropriate price.... There's a lot of room for growth here. No country drinks more coffee than Germany. We will continually expand. This year we will open more than 30 new locations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that means he's satisfied with a low number of premium locations, and won't be really competing with Tchibo or McCaf√© for market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, the title refers to the fact that the best selling product at Starbucks is not coffee, it's the blueberry muffin.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One rule I've been following when blogging about our new business is &quot;no numbers&quot;... which is too bad, since the numbers are the second-most fun part of the business (but not nearly as much fun as the people you work with). If you're really curious, you can check at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/&quot;&gt;mcdonalds.de&lt;/a&gt; things like the average annual sales per restaurant or how much equity is required to become a franchisee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we got our first formal financing offer, and it was somewhat breathtaking to see the monthly payment in black and white. It's one thing to have a line in your projected P&amp;amp;L for debt service, it's quite another to have a concrete payment schedule with a payment that &lt;em&gt;well exceeds&lt;/em&gt; our former gross salaries. Then the enormity of our undertaking becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you blink a couple of times, look at the plan again, and wonder if you're getting a good rate. Maybe the second offer will be a tenth of a percent cheaper...&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Five weeks from yesterday we go officially into business. We're making continual progress... financing, staffing, and remodeling plans are on track, but not yet set. Today we looked at the newly remodeled restaurant in Bispingen with a &quot;Gym and Fun&quot;, 30 sq. m indoor activity area with basketball hoop and padded obstacle course. Christopher was very impressed, and we'd love to have one too. We'll see what the architect (and the bank) have to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been trying to think of a title for me, someone who does a little of everything as needed, but is not the boss. Today we came up with &quot;General Manager&quot;. Now I can finally order business cards. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frauke works nights this week with equipment maintenance and monthly reports on her training schedule. Hopefully Christopher won't wake us up at 6:45 like he did this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/26/bolle-took-a-trip-for-pentecost</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned &lt;em&gt;Pfingstsingen&lt;/em&gt; a few times here, when (separate) groups of boys and girls go house to house on Pentecost Sunday and sing, expecting sweets or some money in return. The tradition is kept alive here in L√ºllau... while we've heard of young men bringing a &lt;em&gt;Pfingstbaum&lt;/em&gt; in other towns, but nowhere else with kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Christopher is now in school, he gets to participate this year (in fact, he's an honorary door ringer... I think that's called the &lt;em&gt;Pfingstbock&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Pfingstpfost&lt;/em&gt;). They've practiced 4 or 5 times and today decorated a wagon where they can deposit their loot. They're also packing water pistols, in case they happen to cross paths with the girls' group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's also had to learn the song &lt;a href=&quot;http://ingeb.org/Lieder/bollerei.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Bolle reiste j√ºngst zu Pfingsten&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an old children's song. I never paid much attention to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolle_reiste_j%C3%BCngst_zu_Pfingsten&quot;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt;. It's in dialect, but I found a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jetzt.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/322343&quot;&gt;modern explanation&lt;/a&gt;. Let's just say that it would never pass the censors these days... child neglect, alcohol abuse, knife fights, domestic violence, and finally suicide. Tipper Gore would have field day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hal remembers that 30 years ago this weekend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  The movie Star Wars (AKA: Star Wars: A New Hope) opened in theaters across the country and set the record for the largest grossing film to date. In my mind, which seldom accounts for much, there are only &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; three Star Wars movies called Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. None of them have the prefix ¬ìStar Wars:¬î.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also has a link to the original review in the New York Times: &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?_r=2&amp;amp;title1=&amp;amp;title2=Star%20Wars%20%28Movie%29&amp;amp;reviewer=VINCENT%20CANBY&amp;amp;pdate=19770526&amp;amp;oref=slogin&amp;amp;oref=login&quot;&gt;¬ëStar Wars¬í A Trip to a Far Galaxy That¬ís Fun and Funny&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher is, shall we say, intensely familiar with both trilogies and contributes most of his allowance money to Lego for their line of Star Wars sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, Star Wars was my &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; favorite movie while in high school. The movie that most entertained and inspired me as teenager came out a year later... &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0077975/&quot;&gt;Animal House&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hildesheim, the founder of Heros, once Germany's leading money transport company, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/23/business/EU-FIN-Germany-Embezzlement-Trial.php&quot;&gt;convicted&lt;/a&gt; (along with 3 managers) of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/02/20/if-you-cant-trust-your-armored-car-company/&quot;&gt;embezzling half a billion Euros&lt;/a&gt; over 2 decades, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Atanta, a former secretary for Coca-Cola was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8PA8HM80.htm&quot;&gt;convicted of conspiring to sell trade secrets&lt;/a&gt; to Pepsi for $1.5 million, and was sentenced to 8 years in prison (longer than was recommended by the prosecution).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've known for months that MamaMaus would have to give up her company car, and we've known for months that we would replace it with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/03/18/crosstouran/&quot;&gt;VW CrossTouran&lt;/a&gt;. It's roomy inside, and has a lot of surface area for company logos. We can also take advantage of the fleet rebate by ordering through McDonald's. We just had to wait until the firm was officially formed before placing the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the paperwork for the GmbH back today, and MamaMaus called the fleet coordinator to say that the order could now be placed. &quot;Great,&quot; she said, &quot;I'll just need you to send back a paper copy with your signature and company stamp, then we can send in the order.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company rubber stamp? We just ordered it today as well, delivery takes 14 days. Noone told us we'd need a stamp immediately. Looks like we'll pick up an instant stamp from Staples and somehow add a logo to it. The Touran is going to take 9 weeks as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related note, MamaMaus ordered business cards for herself, but not for me because we don't know what title I should have. &quot;Co-debtor&quot; probably does not give a good impression.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2007-05-22T02:30:38+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/22/sethblog-in-europe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed following along with Seth and Holly's trip to Paris and London at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sethb.com/weblog/&quot;&gt;SethBlog&lt;/a&gt; (starting with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sethb.com/weblog/archive/2007/05/dday.html&quot;&gt;D-Day&lt;/a&gt; for their departure up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sethb.com/weblog/archive/2007/05/leaving_london.html&quot;&gt;Leaving London&lt;/a&gt; for their flight back home). I think it was their first trip to Europe, and it was interesting to re-experience looking at Europe through Midwestern eyes. It seems like they spent quite a lot of time looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sethb.com/weblog/archive/2007/05/paris_day_two.html&quot;&gt;Iowa-compatible food&lt;/a&gt; (scroll to Tip #5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we've been in Germany for 17 years, and (except to change planes at CDG or Heathrow), we've never been to Paris or London. So you can't call us cosmopolitan either.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Homepage</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/20/homepage/"/>
   <updated>2007-05-20T06:53:15+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/20/homepage</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Homepage&quot; is one of those Anglicisms that has snuck into German and means something slightly different than it does in English. It's not quite as obtuse as &quot;handy&quot;, which in English isn't even a noun, but is a bit confusing nonetheless. A German &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dict.leo.org/ende?lang=en&amp;amp;lp=ende&amp;amp;search=homepage&quot;&gt;Homepage&lt;/a&gt;&quot; refers to an entire website, and not just the start page as one might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever... our business now has a homepage in both senses of the word, since right now it's only a single dummy page. But it's never too early to start building up Google juice. Check it out at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcdonalds-nordheide.de/&quot;&gt;http://mcdonalds-nordheide.de/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've decided to start small with the site design. You might recognize it as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://getk2.com/&quot;&gt;K2 template&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. We've looked at a lot of local McDonald's sites (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-regensburg.de/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds-hannover.de/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are two examples). We considered using a professional design (especially considering that I'm &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/07/09/30-ways-to-leave-your-lover/&quot;&gt;chromatically challenged&lt;/a&gt;&quot;). However I do have a business partner with a good sense of taste and style and the communication skills to get those across, even to me. At this stage, it's more important for the site to be clear and current than to have a &quot;flashy&quot; design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using WordPress as a CMS also fits in our &quot;less is more&quot; strategy for non-essential expenses, particularly for IT. WordPress has enough features for a small site (particularly &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages&quot;&gt;pages&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and being able to set a &quot;front page&quot;). Should we outgrow it, we can always scale up later (as opposed to investing time and money now on something too big for our needs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to start working on content...&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hamburg's Coffee Mile</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/19/hamburgs-coffee-mile</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today's Abendblatt has an article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/05/19/742340.html&quot;&gt;Hamburg's Coffee Mile&lt;/a&gt; on Grindelalle near the University, where 18 coffee shops are located on a 700 meter stretch. None of them are Starbucks. (None of them is a McCaf√©, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest shop seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.balzaccoffee.com/&quot;&gt;Balzac Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, which has 15 coffee shops in Hamburg, and according the Abendblatt they are planning on opening 15 more this year. Vanessa Kullmann, the founder of Balzac, has just written a book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.de%2Fdp%2F3453131118%2F&amp;amp;site-redirect=de&amp;amp;tag=papascott-21&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1638&amp;amp;creative=6742&quot;&gt;&quot;Keine gro√üe Sache&quot;&lt;/a&gt; telling how she started up. MamaMaus received it as a gift as an inspiration for her new business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I think there are 4 Starbucks in Hamburg, but I'm not sure, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starbucks.de/de-de/_Our+Stores/&quot;&gt;store locator&lt;/a&gt; on their website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starbucks.de/de-de/_Our+Stores/_Store+Locator/StoreLocatorPrxResults.htm?a=1&amp;amp;LOC=53.5534027536164%3a9.99246857175934&amp;amp;CT=53.5534027536164%3a9.99246857175934%3a42.7503380259286%3a32.0627535194464&amp;amp;DataSource=MapPoint.EU&amp;amp;GAD2=&amp;amp;GAD3=Hamburg%2c+Hamburg%2c+Germany&amp;amp;IC=53.5534027536164%3a9.99246857175934%3a32%3aHamburg%2c+Hamburg%2c+Germany&amp;amp;CountryID=94&amp;amp;FC=RETAIL&amp;amp;Radius=5&amp;amp;DistanceUnit=Kilometer&quot;&gt;can't find any&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/17/rocket-revisited</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just to follow up on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/10/dreams-for-sale-4645/&quot;&gt;uncanny sense of timing&lt;/a&gt; in the stock market, 5 weeks after exercising a large (for us) number of McDonald's stock options at $46.45, today the stock is selling at over $52. I told you that would happen, it's your own fault if you missed out on the boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, MamaMaus is giving up the first trappings of her life as a jet-set executive. She still has the car and the laptop with VPN access. The first thing she had to give back was the Blackberry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday she was in her power suit at the notary and the bank to set up the GmbH. Today she was in a crew uniform working grill and fries on her first day of in-restaurant training (no, not in Dibbersen, at a company restaurant in Hamburg). Yes, her hands smell like ketchup and pickle juice, just like the good old days. Tomorrow she'll be in drive-thru. And, no, I can't get too haughty, my own re-training will begin in about 6 weeks. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Problem With No</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/16/the-problem-with-no/"/>
   <updated>2007-05-16T09:03:16+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/16/the-problem-with-no</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cem just pointed me to the blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://usaerklaert.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;USA Erkl√§rt&lt;/a&gt; which attempts to explain in German certain things about the USA. When I saw the entry on &lt;a href=&quot;http://usaerklaert.wordpress.com/2006/09/18/warum-amerikaner-briten-kanadier-nicht-sagen-was-sie-meinen/&quot;&gt;Why Americans Don't Say What They Really Mean&lt;/a&gt;, I was struck by the passage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  For example, it is considered crude to say &quot;no&quot; directly, therefore something else will be said that every Anglo-Saxon will understand as &quot;no&quot;, but does not use the word &quot;no&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was bitten by this a couple of weeks ago. A couple days before the May Day &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/28/bridge-days/&quot;&gt;bridge day&lt;/a&gt;, MamaMaus was on the phone with her sister-in-law and they thought it would be a great idea to invite their kids to visit Christopher that day, even though I had to work. I didn't think of much of MamaMaus volunteering my time as a babysitter, and would have much rather taken Christopher to the park or a movie or something, so I told her &quot;no&quot; as directly as I could:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  I really don't know what I would do with them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was of course interpreted as &quot;he would love for them to come&quot;, and thus I was reminded (once again) that to say no to a German you pretty much have to use a two by four with applied centrifugal force. The kids came on Monday, they were bored, I was bored, pretty much as expected. Next time I'll try to remember to be more direct.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that official notice of the upcoming change in ownership has been posted in the restaurant, I am proud to announce that the first location of the Frauke Petersen-Hanson Systemgastronomie GmbH i.G. will be located at **Harburger Str. 19 in Dibbersen/Buchholz**, on the Autobahn A1 between Bremen and Hamburg. For us the restaurant is just 10 minutes drive from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant with McDrive was opened in 2003 and does not yet have a McCaf√©. It is located near a thriving commercial area with the furniture store M√∂bel Kraft and a new Obi home improvement store. A Famila supermarket and a MediaMarkt electronics store are planned for this year. We have every reason to expect satisfaction and success for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Update:** MamaMaus has a soft spot for signage. This will be ours.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our plans for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/03/27/bricks-and-mortar/&quot;&gt;taking over the restaurant&lt;/a&gt; on 1 July are slowing becoming concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MamaMaus' last day of work at the office is Monday. On Tuesday she begins in-store training (at a company restaurant, not our future location). Her employment officially ends on 30 June.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The papers for the GmbH will be signed on Wednesday. The tax advisor says we don't need the 'Co KG', so we're skipping it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written notice of the change in ownership will be posted at the restaurant on Monday, and a formal employee meeting is scheduled a week later. At that point I can say here where we will be located (but if you ask me by mail, I'll tell you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise contract (over 2 cm thick) arrived by courier yesterday, so we now have a final purchase price that can be signed and sent back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 15 May 2007:&lt;/strong&gt; MamaMaus was afraid the tone of this post would be misunderstood, so it's been edited to more accurately reflect our true feelings of giddiness and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Franchisees Fail</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/11/why-franchisees-fail/"/>
   <updated>2007-05-11T07:21:55+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/11/why-franchisees-fail</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week in the Wall Street Journal there was a nice article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117770922300685303.html&quot;&gt;Why Franchisees Fail&lt;/a&gt; (subscribers only, but a copy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.franchiseperfection.com/blog/?p=92&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Even with an established system you can still screw up royally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Weathering unexpected situations without a financial cushion can be problematic even for an established franchise. Ed Moran, an accountant in Tucson, Ariz., recalls a McDonald¬ís Corp. franchisee whose dominance of a small California community was suddenly challenged by the arrival of a competing burger restaurant. The first year, the rival knocked 30% off the McDonald¬ís store¬ís sales. Unwilling to scale back on his lifestyle, the McDonald¬ís franchisee instead reduced his labor overhead and raised prices. ¬ìHe went into a spiral and never came out,¬î Mr. Moran says.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unwilling to scale back on his lifestyle...&lt;/em&gt; that sounds like an epitaph rather than a sound business strategy. (In our business plan we still break even with a 20% sales drop.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we attended the wedding of our good friends &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heidi-ritter.de/&quot;&gt;Heidi&lt;/a&gt; and Robert. The catering crew graciously allowed Christopher to assist serving drinks to the guests. He took this responsibility quite seriously and performed quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bring Her Back!</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/09/bring-her-back</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/print/berlin/652190.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/nasima-el-zein.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NN&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When someone as fervent as J√∂rg Kantel announces he is about to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2007/05/09.html#holtSieZurck&quot;&gt;renounce his political party&lt;/a&gt;, it's worth the time to read his reasons (English translation is mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  In early March Berlin's Interior Senator Ehrhart K√∂rting (SPD) allowed a young women to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2007/0413/politik/0074/index.html&quot;&gt;deported to Turkey&lt;/a&gt; who is not Turkish and does not speak Turkish. Nasima El-Zein grew up in Berlin, graduated from &lt;em&gt;Realschule&lt;/em&gt;, helped foreign schoolchildren as a volunteer in the problem neighborhood of &lt;em&gt;Neuk√∂lln&lt;/em&gt;, helped them with math and German. Who came up with the idea to deport this woman to a land where a violent father awaits to lock her up and send her to a forced marriage? Today the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/print/berlin/652190.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berliner Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the Kurdish woman has been pressured by the Turkish police, and threatened with violence. I think not only the behavior of the Turkish authorities, but also that of Berlin's Interior Senator, to be a scandal. One can only suspect that because the police and the authorities are unable to handle a few wild Turkish-Lebanese families in &lt;em&gt;Neuk√∂lln&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rudow&lt;/em&gt;, the so-called &quot;bouncer mafia&quot;, that they are making an example of this young woman, making a scapegoat of someone who is integrated and cannot defend herself, deporting her to Turkey simply to quiet public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  These actions from Hr. K√∂rting are not only reprehensible, but also violate the principles of his party, the SPD, and human rights... As a party member, I will formally request the expulsion of Hr. K√∂rting from the party. And when the young woman has not returned to Berlin by the end of May 2007, I will take my party book, which documents over 35 years of membership in the SPD, and publicly burn it (i.e. a video will be posted here) and I will urge my fellow party members to do the same.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J√∂rg himself lives in &lt;em&gt;Neuk√∂lln&lt;/em&gt;, so I'm sure he knows what he's talking about. I've heard of some wild deportation cases in Germany, but this seems to rank with the wildest of them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shrek on a diet in McDonald's Happy Meal gig</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/09/shrek-on-a-diet-in-mcdonalds-happy-meal-gig</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reuters, &lt;a href=&quot;http://yahoo.reuters.com/news/articlehybrid.aspx?storyID=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20070508:MTFH92768_2007-05-08_22-50-45_N08197556&amp;amp;type=comktNews&quot;&gt;Shrek on a diet in McDonald's Happy Meal gig&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  On Tuesday, McDonald's and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., the studio behind the upcoming &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; movie, unveiled a promotion in which Shrek, Donkey and other characters from the animated film will be used to sell Happy Meals and other McDonald's food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  But unlike previous movie tie-ins, McDonald's will use Shrek to feature its salads, milk, apple slices and other products ... A Happy Meal with Apple Dippers, all-white-meat chicken McNuggets, and low-fat milk will be featured in television commercials and on posters in McDonald's restaurants. Shrek will also appear on packaging for the milk and apples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  While the apples, milk, salads and other featured products have been on McDonald's menu for more than a year, Chief Marketing Officer Mary Dillon said the company still had &quot;opportunities to drive awareness both with parents and kids about these offerings.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good! It's one thing to add healthy products to the menu, it's another thing to actually put marketing money behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cynics might say that McDonald's is only responding to &quot;mounting criticism its food was not only unhealthy, but also contributing to the increase in overweight kids in the United States&quot;. I would say that McDonald's is responding to consumer demand, which I guess amounts to the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sprechblase.wordpress.com/2007/05/06/aua/&quot;&gt;Cem&lt;/a&gt; passed on this questionaire to me. For some reason, in German these questionaires are called a &lt;em&gt;St√∂ckchen&lt;/em&gt;, a stick you throw for a dog to fetch. So I'm obediently picking up the stick...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you use social bookmarking/networking sites like Digg, Yigg, Mister Wong or Del.Icio.Us?&lt;/strong&gt; I use del.icio.us, but not regularly. It's much easier to share links on Google Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you watch videos at portals like YouTube, Sevenload or DailyMotion an?&lt;/strong&gt; Not really, I find the written word more interesting than moving pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you know of or use Flickr?&lt;/strong&gt; I use Flickr only as an image store. I don't use any of the social features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think of services like Twitter or Frazr?&lt;/strong&gt; I don't know yet. I've tried Twitter, but I don't get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many RSS feeds do you subscribe to?&lt;/strong&gt; 322 at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you read them all daily?&lt;/strong&gt; No. I have my feeds grouped by priority, some to read immediately, some to read daily, and some to check when I have the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many blogs do you write for (own or as co-author)?&lt;/strong&gt; Only one. I've tried starting a second blog for non-personal topics, but found it too schizophrenic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you comment in other blogs?&lt;/strong&gt; Not as often as I would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is your personal ¬ìBlog King of Germany¬î?&lt;/strong&gt; I didn't know we had a king. I thought we were an autonomous collective. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/quotes&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think weblogs belong to the futures, or are they just a temporary hype?&lt;/strong&gt; I've been &quot;blogging&quot; in one form or another since I was 16 years old. Back then I used a typewriter and a mimeograph, now I use the internet. It's just a medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you blog be a part of that future?&lt;/strong&gt; I will be writing in some form or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are we alone in the Universe?&lt;/strong&gt; Does it matter? Knowing for sure one way or the other wouldn't change me or my life at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who's next to answer these questions?&lt;/strong&gt; Whoever is brave enough to try.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nico has yet &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3422&quot;&gt;another new project&lt;/a&gt;, namely a technical job board entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://webzweinulljobs.de/&quot;&gt;webzweinulljobs.de&lt;/a&gt;, born from his experience how difficult it is to find good administrators and developers.

   <title>Flash Slideshow with Captions</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/08/flash-slideshow-with-captions/"/>
   <updated>2007-05-08T06:39:04+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/08/flash-slideshow-with-captions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a kind of wedding present for our former &lt;em&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/em&gt;, I helped her set up a web site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heidi-ritter.de/&quot;&gt;http://www.heidi-ritter.de/&lt;/a&gt; to promote her child care business. However, I've kind of developed myself into a hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up the design using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/&quot;&gt;RapidWeaver&lt;/a&gt;, a nice website creation tool for OS X. I choose it mostly because there are some nice ready-made design templates available (I'm colorblind, and can't match colors to save my life) but also because I knew there was an add-in to enable Heidi to edit her site online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we ended up deciding to use photo galleries instead of straight web pages, telling her story with pictures instead of words (for example, her &lt;a href=&quot;http://heidi-ritter.de/schwerpunkte/schwerpunkte.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schwerpunkte&lt;/em&gt; page&lt;/a&gt;). RapidWeaver can produce static photo galleries, but they can't be edited with the online tool. And since she doesn't have a Mac, I can't simply install RapidWeaver for her. So now I'm stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I played with the slide show creator at [slide.com](http://www.slide.com/), and it's almost what I want. It creates a Flash slideshow with captions (see my &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open('http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/schwerpunkte.html', '1', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=426,height=350'); return false;&quot;&gt;test slideshow&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Schwerpunkte&lt;/em&gt; photos). It's editable online, and it's quite easy to add pictures, change text, and rearrange the order. It would be nice to be have more control over the speed and text format, and I don't need links to the original pictures. Another possibility would be a Windows application so Heidi can create an maintain her slideshows locally. There are a number of free and commercial possibilities, but I haven't started exploring yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking that an embedded Flash applet would be nice since then I can put the site into a mini-CMS like Wordpress, and I only have to design the main pages and not a separate gallery as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'll put the question to the audience. Do you have any ideas on how I can best include a set of pictures on a small commercial site that's easy to edit and maintain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our soon-to-be restaurant does not have a McCaf√© yet, but we want one as quickly as we can and our it's included in our financial planning for this year. Maybe it will look something like this (design concept Generation Wenge)...&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Corrupted UTF-8 characters with PHP and MySQL</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/05/corrupted-utf-8-characters-with-php-and-mysql/"/>
   <updated>2007-05-05T04:58:19+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/05/05/corrupted-utf-8-characters-with-php-and-mysql</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone recently asked me about corrupted characters in a PHP-MySQL project. They had recent stable versions of everything, MySQL 5.0 and PHP 5.1, using UTF-8 for everything, and they were getting corrupted accented characters saved in the database, junk with '√É's was coming out. They were asking me if there were perhaps some secret PHP setting they were missing to make things right. Not that I knew of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have thought that in this day and age using UTF-8 with PHP and MySQL would just work. To try this out for myself, I downloaded some simple tutorial code, set up databases and HTML with UTF-8, and started creating records with names like Sc√∂tt H√§ns√∂n and M√§cky M√∂√º√üe. And sure enough, I got junk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP and MySQL don't just work with UTF-8. In particular, the client connection from PHP to MySQL defaults to latin1. There don't seem to be any PHP settings to change this. On the MySQL side there are 'default-character-set' settings you can put in various sections of the my.cnf, but for me they didn't seem to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found two ways to solve the problem. The first is to issue a &lt;code&gt;mysql_query(&quot;SET NAMES 'utf8')&lt;/code&gt; immediately after every &lt;code&gt;mysql_connect&lt;/code&gt; to manually switch the connection to utf8. That's a huge pain if you have a lot of code (even in my mini 5-file test-case I forgot one instance at first).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is to add a &lt;code&gt;init-connect='SET NAMES utf8'&lt;/code&gt; setting to the &lt;code&gt;[mysqld]&lt;/code&gt; section of my.cnf. &lt;code&gt;init-connect&lt;/code&gt; automatically executes SQL commands at the beginning of every client connection. The catch is the commands won't be executed for a user with SUPER privileges, so if you're lazy and using 'root' to connect to your database, it won't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using various combinations of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta charset=&quot;blah&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the HTML and &lt;code&gt;SET NAMES&lt;/code&gt; for the database connection, you can create interesting errors. The '√É' errors seem to occur when correctly sent utf-8 is incorrectly saved over a latin1 connection, then read back out as utf-8. My friend said he was using &lt;code&gt;SET NAMES 'utf8'&lt;/code&gt; with all his connects, I'm guessing he forgot it for INSERTs and UPDATEs. That's just a hunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't able to find a clear explanation of this in Google (the closest was in the comments to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-client-encoding.php&quot;&gt;mysql&amp;#95;client&amp;#95;encoding()&lt;/a&gt; in the PHP documentation), so I thought write this up here. It's clear to me, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll admit to being guilty of all of these at some time or another, but I try especially hard to avoid number 7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Forgetting Courtesy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  If you want support from management, consider remembering that the user you offend today could wind up on the board of directors. Regardless of that possibility, system administrators should always remember that their clients are internal and if you want to keep your job, be good to your clients.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be smart and help people without being arrogant. It's more fun that way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shop Til You Drop</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The regulation of shopping hours in Germany is now a matter for the states rather than the federal government, and most states have taken the opportunity to deregulate shopping hours Monday through Saturday. Here in Niedersachsen the deregulation took effect this month, and our local Rewe supermarket is now open until 9:00 pm 6 days a week. We've taken advantage of the extra hour a few times already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we came to Germany the restricted shopping hours was the biggest thing I had to get used to. Back then shops closed at 6:30 pm during the week and 2:00 pm on Saturday. But the times have become longer and longer, first until 8:00 pm on weekdays, and then 8:00 pm every Saturday. Now it's a non-issue, and I imagine that sooner or later Sunday closing will also be a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case you're wondering about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/08/needles-and-pins/&quot;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; (my last &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/05/traction-times-ten/&quot;&gt;real update&lt;/a&gt; was in February), things are going pretty well. I've been pain-free since the beginning of March, although I do feel some tension or tiredness in my lower back from time to time. I've been going to a physiotherapist (my next-door neighbor), and she's been teaching me the basics... how to sit, how to stand, last week I tried walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dr-wolff.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/dr-wolff-back-training.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dr Wolff Back Training&quot; title=&quot;Dr Wolff&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Last week I started a 8-week training course at a local fitness studio. They have a set of machines from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dr-wolff.com/&quot;&gt;Dr. Wolff&lt;/a&gt; to train the upper and lower back. The cost is covered by health insurance, and since we are supposed to work out on our own between sessions, it works out like a trial membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is that since the initial injection at the beginning of January, I've taken absolutely no pain medication. I no longer have the TENS device (it was more a nuisance than a help), and I'm not taking any more chiropractic treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My therapist (er, my neighbor) would like me to ergonomically optimize my workplace. Since I'm about to switch jobs, I'm not sure where my new workplace is going to be. I guess I'll have to work that out with my new boss.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>McDonald's on Sabine Christiansen Tonight</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sabinechristiansen.de/&quot;&gt;Sabine Christiansen&lt;/a&gt; talk show on ARD is on the topic of obesity, and among the guests is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/presse/basis/vorstand/goebel.html&quot;&gt;Wolfgang Goebel&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President for Operations for McDonald's Deutschland (and, for a few more days, MamaMaus' boss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're no big fans of Christiansen, but her show is the best known talk show on German television. We usually don't stay up until 21:45 on Sunday nights, but tonight we might make an exception. I do suspect, though, that the producers deliberately chose a soft topic for the holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bridge Days</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/28/bridge-days/"/>
   <updated>2007-04-28T06:45:22+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/28/bridge-days</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While admiring the new design of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gsjesteburg.de/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for Christopher's school (looks like somebody has a Web 2.0 logo generator) a couple of days, I thought I'd check the the list of school holidays. When we put up paper calendars for 2007, we didn't write in the school holidays since we're still new at this school parenting business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough there are some holidays coming up that we didn't plan for. The first is this coming Monday, the &lt;strong&gt;Day before May Day&lt;/strong&gt;. This seems to be a sporadic holiday only celebrated when May Day falls on a Tuesday. We're totally unprepared... we not only have no plans, we didn't even take the day off from work. In our defense, my sister-in-law who has two kids in &lt;em&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/em&gt; didn't know about it either, although the logistics of leaving 7th graders at home is a bit easier than for a 1st grader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next unexpected holiday was not so unexpected, the &lt;strong&gt;Day after Ascension&lt;/strong&gt;. Ascension only falls on Thursday, and the next day must be the most unproductive work day on the German calendar. That the schools are also closed is then logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there's a holiday that's totally new for us, &lt;strong&gt;Pentecost Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt; (would that be Whittues in &lt;a href=&quot;http://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;BrE&lt;/a&gt;)? In our years in Germany, we've never noticed that the kids go back to school a day later after the Pentecost weekend, probably because we've never had a kid in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/31/report-card-vacation/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report Card Vacation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; celebrated in February, we have a number of new holidays that we will be celebrating for the next 10 or 13 years (whichever the case may be). Note that these holidays are regionally variable. The schoolkids in Hamburg, for example, celebrate a yearly &lt;strong&gt;Ski Vacation&lt;/strong&gt;, even though there is no place in Hamburg to ski.&lt;/p&gt;

And here I was all set to start a counter-rumor that he was really coming to Hamburg to start working for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some initial systems consulting for the project (OK, it was more like &quot;Can you set up a server for us?&quot; &quot;Sure, no problem.&quot;), so I've been in on the secret. And note that they have a .com domain rather than .de. Their plans for world domination are not limited to the German-speaking world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tidbit: the project has been blogging under a code name in English for several weeks, but the rumormongers don't seem to have found it yet. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These jobbies cost me ¬Ä1.50 each at Karstadt a few years ago. You'll notice that we &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dremel&quot;&gt;dremeled&lt;/a&gt; out the safety tabs on one of them so we can insert cords that normally require grounding. Yes, these adapters are just like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed&quot;&gt;Corvair, unsafe at any speed&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These adapters don't converte the voltage, of course. We only bring along devices that work with 110 volts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One the one hand, here it is currently &lt;em&gt;en vogue&lt;/em&gt; to complain about amoral American hedge funds, comparing them to locusts. Today on NDR Info I heard about the shareholders' meeting of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,464443,00.html&quot;&gt;Cewe Color&lt;/a&gt;. Its hedge fund shareholders are demanding the resignation of the CEO and a special debt-financed dividend for shareholders (i.e. themselves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this week &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,479631,00.html&quot;&gt;Klaus Kleinfeld resigned&lt;/a&gt; as chairman of Siemens. A big factor in his resignation was apparently the tougher corporate ethics regulation in the US, which applies to Siemens since it is listed on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm confused now about which country has the more moral corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

The map shows the cities with the highest and lowest number of fast food meals per capita per month. Do I detect a geographical pattern here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what the numbers for Germany would look like... not just fast-food chains, of course, but also including &lt;em&gt;Currywurst&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;D√∂ner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Brath√§hnchen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fischbr√∂tchen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jura XF50</title>

   <updated>2007-04-24T05:05:10+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/24/jura-xf50</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in 2003 I posted on the folly of spending &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/12/24/espresso-love/&quot;&gt;100s of Euros on a coffee machine&lt;/a&gt; and that we were happy with our cheapy plastic machine where we did everything by hand. In the meantime the plastic machine went out, and we switched to a metal machine from AEG where we still did everything by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last December at one of MamaMaus' meetings in Munich all mid-managers got a heavy box approximately 50 cm on all sides (like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2047&quot;&gt;Dell box&lt;/a&gt; folded in half). She didn't even try to take it on the plane with her, she had it shipped to her office. Then it barely fit in her car to bring home. It was a Christmas present, a full-automatic Jura Impressa XF50 espresso machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/470857618/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.static.flickr.com/206/470857618_a2a0a08994.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_1982&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a commercial machine, just like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fairfax.jura.com/en/ccuk/products_uk/products_home/products_f-line/f50.htm&quot;&gt;retail F50&lt;/a&gt; but in black. What we used to lovingly assemble, brew and clean every day was now available at the touch of a button. We got used to the convenience rather quickly. Our daily joke in the morning is now &quot;Can I make you a cup of coffee&quot;. Since it's absolutely no effort anymore, it's not that much of a favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's quite large, luckily we have a dead corner on the kitchen counter that it fills up quite nicely. We were afraid that it would be as hard to set up as a video recorder, but it was actually quite easy, and once set up you can pretty much forget it. It even shuts itself off when it's not been used for a few hours. Just do what the screen tells you to do. Fill water, fill beans, empty tray (for water and used grounds). You'll want to rinse out the tray daily, though, if you don't want nasties to grow in it. We use the optional water filters, so we don't have to decalc, instead changing the filter every 2 months. The screen even tells you when to clean. We've done that twice since Christmas, dropping in a tablet and running water through. The filters and tablets are not that expensive, you can get them at Media Markt or on eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 4 months with the Jura we're quite happy with it. We still probably wouldn't spend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geizkragen.de/preisvergleich/haushalt/kaffee-und-co/espressomaschinen/jura/jura-impressa-f50/118125.html&quot;&gt;the ¬Ä800&lt;/a&gt; on it ourselves, but it's a nice luxury to have, and we would miss it if we now had to do without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandma sent Christopher this cool Lilo and Stitch T-Shirt, but it was too big. So we had it altered. Now it fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Christopher would like a certain Star Wars model as a late Easter present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a name. And a sign. McDonald's doesn't want franchisees to use 'Mc' or any trademarks or product names when naming their companies, so fun names like 'McMaus' are out. So we've gone for something boring and practical. And yes, we know the sign has typos. It's just a first draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile MamaMaus has visited a consultant and a bookkeeping service (husband and wife, actually), has been to two banks and the local *Wirtschaftsf√∂rderung* (business development) office, and has appointments next week with a lawyer and a tax advisor. Meanwhile she's still working on showing her successor around the region, taking day trips to places like Kiel, G√∂ttingen, Braunschweig and Oldenburg. The handover will take another 3 weeks or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still waiting for a franchise contract and a concrete purchase price. MamaMaus has negotiated such sales in the past, though, so we have a good a idea how much it will be. And we've got our first bit of capital sitting liquid in a cash management account.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lectures about Guns</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/18/lectures-about-guns/"/>
   <updated>2007-04-18T19:45:25+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/18/lectures-about-guns</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the shootings in at Virginia Tech, there have been the usual comments in the German media about the lack of gun control laws in the US. I can think of a few ways to point the finger back here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The largest employer in my wife's home town is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sauer-waffen.de/index.php?id=sauer&amp;amp;lang=en&quot;&gt;Sauer &amp;amp; Sohn&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Germany's oldest's gun manufacturer&quot; since 250 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006 there were nearly 350,000 registered hunters in Germany&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where we live, the main social club in most towns is the &lt;em&gt;Sch√ºtzenverein&lt;/em&gt;, or shooting club. The biggest social event of the year is the &lt;em&gt;Sch√ºtzenfest&lt;/em&gt;, where shooting is combined with alcohol. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.germany-tourism.de/ENG/destination_germany/master_tlevents-id1099-fstadt_event_allgemein.htm?cc_lang=&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sch√ºtzenfest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Hannover can be compared with the Oktoberfest in Munich or the Dom in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we just moved here I was told I could make big money smuggling trigger mechanisms from the US into Germany. Gun fans in Germany could import non-functional weapons from the US, but the mechanisms were not so easy to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems every few months there is a gun accident involving children here, almost always involving a legal but unlocked gun from a parent. The US National Rifle Association may be a gun lobby, but they also teach basic gun safety, which includes keeping one's guns locked when stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Andrew at German Joys &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2007/04/guns_and_tirade.html&quot;&gt;makes the point&lt;/a&gt; much more logically than I ever could. Lax gun laws in the US make life slighty unsafer than in Europe, but only slightly. It's not enough to get on your high horse.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Most Socially Responsible?</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/18/most-socially-responsible/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quick Serve Kids: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickservekids.com/2007/04/quickserves_most_socially_resp.html&quot;&gt;Quick-Serves Most Socially Responsible?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technomic.com/pressroom/corporate_social_4_07.html&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. consumer attitudes toward corporate social responsibility in foodservice, Technomic found that restaurant users rated health insurance coverage, living wages and animal welfare as their top three concerns, when asked to select among 14 different issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  In general, consumers believe restaurant chains could do more to address their high priority social issues. The chains that consumers view as being most socially responsible are McDonald¬ís, Chick-fil-A, Subway, Starbucks and Applebee¬ís.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting that healthy menu and obesity weren't among the top issues. It is also interesting that in Germany corporate responsibility seems to be a non-issue. Corporations are assumed to be irresponsible, and any effort to demonstrate social responsibility is dismissed as a PR gag. Or am I wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sex and Drugs</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/16/sex-and-drugs/"/>
   <updated>2007-04-16T20:49:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/16/sex-and-drugs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First I find out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.janegalt.net/archives/009761.html&quot;&gt;sex education doesn't make any difference&lt;/a&gt; for adolescent sexual behavior. Teenagers don't have sex any later, or are any more likely to use birth control... in other words, all sex education is useless, whether abstinence-based or not. (That makes sense to me, sex education was one of the most boring subjects in junior high, and turned out to be of no practical use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I find out that &lt;a href=&quot;http://instapundit.com/archives2/004209.php&quot;&gt;drinking age also makes no difference&lt;/a&gt;. The US (along with Indonesia, Mongolia and Palau) has the highest drinking age in the world, yet &quot;high school students in much of the rest of the developed world ¬ó where lower drinking ages and laxer enforcement reign ¬ó do considerably better than US students on standardized tests&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next they'll tell me that &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0079813/&quot;&gt;rock and roll does not cause brain damage in mice&lt;/a&gt;. Then the destruction of all my adolescent myths will be complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since our first visit to Legoland, Christopher has wanted to complete the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legoland.dk/LEGOLAND/rides/miniland.htm?view=Browse&amp;amp;lc=en&amp;amp;spotguid=%7B43085DDA-527A-4DC9-BCF6-F51D423DBD83%7D&quot;&gt;Legoland Traffic School&lt;/a&gt; and earn his driver's license... however, they only accept applicants age 7 or older. This year Christopher is 7, and (as you can see from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157600058152348/&quot;&gt;photo set&lt;/a&gt;) he attended the Traffic School last week. He now has an official Legoland Driver's License for Germany, even though he ran at least one red light and wrongly signalled most of his turns (he'd signal right, then turn left, or vice versa). Whatever. The back side of the license is a (fake) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statoil.com/&quot;&gt;StatOil&lt;/a&gt; credit card, and they just happen to be the main sponsor of the Traffic School. Good thing we don't have any StatOil stations in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we've started setting up our business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the upper left you can see the two founders. They are stubborn as donkeys, and have already dressed warm (*haben sich warm angezogen*) in preparation for the tough times ahead. Between them is a crystal ball with a vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To their right is a device for cutting costs. If twisted just right it can also be used to cut corners. On the shelf beneath them we are trying to bring light into the darkness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hmm, somehow this seemed much funnier when we were cleaning out the shelf. But the two binders to the left are really our first business files.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Coffee and the German Banking System</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/13/coffee-and-the-german-banking-system/"/>
   <updated>2007-04-13T03:24:52+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/13/coffee-and-the-german-banking-system</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in 1995 when we were planning to build our house, we thought we'd be smart and check out the best mortgage rates in the local paper. One of the banks listed was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berliner-bank.de/&quot;&gt;Berliner Bank&lt;/a&gt;, and when we went in they offered us coffee and said sorry, the rate listed in the paper was a printing error, but they could offer us a mortgage anyway. They were the only bank to offer us coffee, an entire pot with ceramic cups at that. Of course that's where we ended up getting our financing. The fact that Berliner Bank later nearly went bankrupt because of shady real estate deals has nothing to do with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MamaMaus has known for a long time that she eventually wanted to go into business for herself, and has been trying to develop a coffee-drinking relationship with her bank. A bank is of course happiest when you either have a large account balance or a large debt, preferably both at the same time. They love it when she gets her annual bonus. &quot;Hello, we notice you have an unusually high balance at the moment... can we invite you in for coffee?&quot; Re-financing the above-mentioned mortgage was another coffee-drinking moment which I got to share. (The mortgage is in her name, but my signature was required as &lt;em&gt;Mitschuldner&lt;/em&gt;, or co-debtor. &lt;em&gt;Mitschuldner&lt;/em&gt; has since become one of our favorite terms of endearment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention all this only because the proceeds from our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/04/10/dreams-for-sale-4645/&quot;&gt;stock transaction&lt;/a&gt; has hit our bank account (we've been lucky, the stock is only up 20 cents since then). Now we've got to quickly put the money someplace before the bank invites her in for coffee again. We want to save the coffee drinking for the actual financing of the business, plus a small renovation we want to do right away, so we're not ready to go into caffeine shock quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, we sold on the day of a 7-year high, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MCD&quot;&gt;MCD&lt;/a&gt; is probably going to take off like a rocket now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MamaMaus brought home this picture and said it would be good for PapaScott. File it under McDonald's humor that McDonald's people find funny. If you've never sent a child to a German school, this is obviously a school lunch &lt;em&gt;Pausenbrot&lt;/em&gt; in a different wrapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to come from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2464453&quot;&gt;ad campaign for McDonald's Austria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can't tell you where it is yet, but we can show it to you, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.de&quot;&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I guess we can paint a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/maps/roof-wanted-for-google-maps-ad-149029.php&quot;&gt;logo on the roof&lt;/a&gt;, then wait a couple years for Google to update their images... although a Target store has somewhat more roof space than we will. (Seriously, we will look into it... MamaMaus says the store is clearly visible to planes landing at Hamburg Airport from the south. And it would be a great way to get free publicity for a day.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting tomorrow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcdonalds.de/presse/index.php?pressid=213&quot;&gt;all 1270 McDonald's in Germany will be non-smoking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Zum 31. M√§rz werden die rund 1.270 deutschen Restaurants von McDonald¬ís rauchfrei sein. Mit dieser freiwilligen Selbstverpflichtung leistet McDonald¬ís einen aktiven Beitrag zum Gesundheitsschutz. Durch die Umstellung sollen insbesondere Familien und Kinder vor den sch√§dlichen Folgen des Passivrauchens gesch√ºtzt werden.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald's is the first German restaurant company to go totally non-smoking, but I'm sure others will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

But I doubt that our field consultant would approve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Because oil floats on water, despite the massive heat (163 degrees Celsius) the goldfish simply stay away from the surface and all is well. They eat the crumbs of croquettes and other fried foods that fall to the bottom, and can live in there for 5-10 years as they happily clean away, ignorant to the fact that certain death awaits any potential escapees.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Despite the excitement of our upcoming business venture, we still have our usual everyday events. Right now Christopher has two weeks off school for Easter vacation, and I've taken the time off work. MamaMaus works this week, but we'll all three be taking off to Oslo and Denmark for a few days next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Christopher and I took advantage of the sunny weather to head to Hamburg. After hitting the Lego store, we headed to the harbor for the cheapest harbor tour in town... the HADAG commuter ferry, all you need is a HVV subway ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then went to the springtime &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/23/hamburger-dom/&quot;&gt;Hamburger Dom&lt;/a&gt;, Hamburg's carnival midway. If you've been to Oktoberfest, imagine the Wies'n without the obnoxious beer tents (however difficult that may be). Today was even family day, so every stand had special prices.&lt;/p&gt;

One of her team members told her on the phone this evening, &quot;I guess you'll only be around for a couple more days... plus twenty years&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's true. The franchise contract for McDonald's runs for twenty years. By that time I'll be 65 and ready for something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, many franchise contracts are extended into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2007/03/19/focus2.html?b=1174276800%5E1432966&quot;&gt;&quot;second generation&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. In twenty years Christopher will be 27...&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some big changes are coming to the PapaScott household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 23 years with McDonald's, 16 years in Germany, MamaMaus will be leaving McDonald's Deutschland Inc. She has been Regional Manager for Northern Germany since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, she will fulfill her long-time dream and become a McDonald's licensee. She will be given the opportunity to purchase an existing restaurant here in northern Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is that we both will be able to run the business together. We will see and work with each other every day. After the past couple of years of frequent business trips, that will be a welcome change. That means I will be leaving my job at MediaVentures this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks we will be arranging a few details like founding the business, signing the franchise contract, and arranging the financing of several hundred thousand Euros (our banker is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; friendly to us at the moment). In May MamaMaus begins in-restaurant training (as if she has very much to learn). When all goes according to plan, two months later we will be in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/03/20/mcdonald%e2%80%99s-seeks-to-redefine-%e2%80%98mcjob%e2%80%99/&quot;&gt;McJob&lt;/a&gt; being &quot;unstimulating&quot; with &quot;few prospects&quot;. Our prospects are looking better than ever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  The UK arm of the fast food chain is starting a campaign to get British dictionary publishers to revise their definitions of the word ¬ìMcJob¬î, a term the Oxford English Dictionary describes as ¬ìan unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects, esp. one created by the expansion of the service sector¬î...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  ¬ìWe believe that (the definition) is out of date, out of touch with reality and most importantly it is insulting to those talented, committed, hard-working people who serve the public every day,¬î wrote David Fairhurst, chief people officer in northern Europe for McDonald¬ís, in a letter seen by the Financial Times seeking support for the petition. ¬ìIt¬ís time the dictionary definition of ¬ìMcJob¬î changed to reflect a job that is stimulating, rewarding and offers genuine opportunities for career progression and skills that last a lifetime.¬î&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  McDonald¬ís says it has an excellent record of promoting female workers and entry level staff to senior executive positions. In the UK, half the executive team started on the shop floor and 25 per cent are women.

&lt;p&gt;We're looking at a new notebook for MamaMaus. Since I don't think I can talk her into an Apple (&quot;I don't want to learn anything new!&quot;), I asked her what features she needed. &quot;It needs to be small,&quot; she said, &quot;and powerful.&quot; That wasn't a big help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she added, &quot;I saw a red notebook from Samsung that looked pretty good.&quot; Well, if color is a main criterion, at least that limits the field somewhat. And the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsung.com/uk/products/mobilecomputing/qseries/np_q35t007suk.asp&quot;&gt;Samsung Q35 Red&lt;/a&gt; actually seems pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

It's kind of a cross between a SUV and a van, but the TDI still gets 6.2 l per 100 km (that's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=6.2+l+per+100+km+in+mpg&quot;&gt;38 mpg&lt;/a&gt;).

It covers illness or property crimes, and that's it. However, the policy for our Easter vacation ferry trip to Oslo has several clauses. Not only is our vacation protected against illness and crime, but also against losing a job, finding a job, starting a new job, having to repeat a failed test, or being drafted into the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, if you're unemployed you can insure yourself against finding a job. Only in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's a crazy and fun way to waste cycles on your MacBook... redub cartoons with your kids! We have a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch:_The_Series&quot;&gt;Lilo and Stitch&lt;/a&gt; episodes on our HD recorder, and after second or third time Christopher starts saying the lines along with the TV. &quot;If this keeps up we can just turn off the sound and let you say everything,&quot; I told him. And then I remembered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/&quot;&gt;iMovie&lt;/a&gt; has a redub function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not using any equipment, just a plain headset plugged into the MacBook, but we're doing this just for fun. I've never done any kind of audio or video work before, so it's kind of tedious to blend the tracks in and out. And Christopher is very fussy with himself. It took us an hour to record two 10 second bits for one character. I'm sure there are some tricks to yet to learn about editing quickly or compressing the bits to fit an exact time frame (maybe in GarageBand?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we're both having a blast, and maybe in a week or two we'll have the scene ready and we can watch (or at least listen to) ourselves for a couple of minutes on the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/03/13/irritable-and-distracted</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the lack of subtance here lately. (Actually, that's just a phrase. I'm not really sorry at all.) There are a couple of explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm irritable. I'm losing weight (again). I can lose weight like other people can stop smoking. It's so easy, I've done it dozens of times. However, this time I've just finished a huge bout of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/08/needles-and-pins/&quot;&gt;negative motivation&lt;/a&gt;, and there's no way I ever want to go through that again. Hopefully that's what it will take to make it stick. But in the meantime I'm grumpy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm distracted. There's something very huge and very good that's going to happen this year that's going to mean big changes for all of us in the PapaScott household. But I can't talk about it yet, except to say that it in no way involves childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 27 Mar 2007:&lt;/strong&gt; I made this post private after the first four comments.  Not that any of them were close to guessing the secret, but anyone who knew us personally would have immediately known what the &quot;big change&quot; was. The secret will be released today, so I've made the post public again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;MamaMaus has once again graced the pages of the Bild Zeitung, this time not just the Hamburg edition, but nationwide on Page 2: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/news/2007/03/06/job-wunder/mittelstand-motor.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jobwunder Mittelstand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (online edition, click through the &lt;em&gt;Mehr zum Thema&lt;/em&gt; box, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/news/2007/03/06/job-wunder/kt-galerie-jobwunder,templateId=renderInline,rendertext=1489534.html&quot;&gt;look here for just her&lt;/a&gt;), although I'm not sure her employer, an American DJIA-listed corporation, really qualifies as German Mittelstand.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ironicsans.com/state22.html&quot;&gt;Fifty States in Ten Minutes&lt;/a&gt; is a cute quiz to see how many states you can name in 10 minutes. I got the first 47 in three minutes, but could only add Idaho a couple of minutes later. Not bad for an expat, but I'm sure there are deep psychological reasons for forgetting New Jersey and Utah.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/404566353/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.static.flickr.com/132/404566353_f85068dbd0_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; alt=&quot;27022007072&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/march#sat-03-lasseter&quot;&gt;John Gruber linked&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/movies/04hols.html?ex=1330664400&amp;amp;en=ef352800b0d761b9&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;profile of John Lasseter&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Toy Story and Cars and now chief creative officer at Disney Feature Animation. The undertone of the friction of the Pixar and Disney corporate cultres is interesting, as well as the mention that &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/name/nm0761498/&quot;&gt;Chris Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, the writer and director of Lilo and Stitch, will be leaving Disney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's interesting for us because Lilo and Stitch is Christopher's current obessesion. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://psc.disney.go.com/disneychannel/liloandstitch/index.html&quot;&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt; is currently on Super RTL, and it's the only show he watches (albeit twice a day) (although as a treat we'll sometimes let him watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://tv.disney.go.com/disneychannel/kimpossible/index.html&quot;&gt;Kim Possible&lt;/a&gt;). He knows the names and numbers of the 625 experiments, he tries to sing along with the theme song (in Hawaiian), and even has a Stitch plush toy (which we ordered from a E-Bay seller in Hong Kong, since they don't seem to be available at all in Europe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting is that Christopher an incessant drawer, going through reams of paper (emptying the paper trays of the computer printers), and seems interested in how animation is made. He asked &quot;who invented Lilo and Stitch&quot;, so we looked up on Wikipedia and IMDB and found the writers were &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/gallery/ss/0275847/Ss/0275847/Top.jpg.html&quot;&gt;Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois&lt;/a&gt;. That's how I immediately recognized the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/409636423/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/409636423_65e6259de4_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; alt=&quot;04032007075&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have no idea whether Christopher has any drawing talent, but he has fun with it. This week we got him an easel at Ikea with a chalkboard and whiteboard, so our paper costs should be reduced drastically, and maybe the paper will stay in our printers. The last episode of the series is being broadcast this week, so maybe he'll have to find a new obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Attempted Denial-of-Service Attack</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/24/attempted-denial-of-service-attack</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher and I are playing bachelor this weekend. Today we decided to go toy and tech shopping in Hamburg. We drove to the Park-and-Ride in Harburg and took the S-Bahn downtown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we returned to drive home, the lock in the drivers' side door was stuck and would only partially turn. The passenger side lock was completely jammed and I could not insert the key. My first thought was that my key was damaged. I was able to open the back hatch, however, so Christopher could climb in and open the doors from the inside. The ignition also switched on with no problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got home I tried my spare key with the same results. I can only conclude that a &quot;friendly&quot; passerby in the parking ramp decided it would be fun to jam the door locks on a certain VW Lupo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I still prefer a proper lock with a physical key to the electronic key for MamaMaus' Audi. One time last month she came back in the house after she started her car, and left her key in the kitchen. She was able to drive off, but was then unable to start the car again when she wanted to come home. Good thing she was only at the grocery store, and not some far-away city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my back, I'm making good progress. As my father phrased it, it no longer hurts, it's just stiff and sore. I can sleep through the night without pain, and today I drove to Hamburg and back without any pain for the first time since November. I must be doing something right.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>pfSense: M0n0wall and more</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/20/pfsense-m0n0wall-and-more/"/>
   <updated>2007-02-20T21:19:39+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/20/pfsense-m0n0wall-and-more</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been a big fan of the FreeBSD-based firewall &lt;a href=&quot;http://m0n0.ch/wall&quot;&gt;M0n0wall&lt;/a&gt; for some time. Yesterday I finally got around to trying out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pfsense.com/&quot;&gt;pfSense&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on M0n0wall but which can take advantage of bigger hardware. It's only been a day, but I think I'm hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M0n0wall was developed for embedded devices, and can work with a minimum of CPU, memory and disk (or CF). That means that it doesn't have some features you might find handy in a firewall, like a login shell or a packet sniffer (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xs4all.nl/~fredmol/m0n0/&quot;&gt;they can be hacked in&lt;/a&gt;, but still). M0n0wall does run on x86 hardware, but it's going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.m0n0.ch/handbook/faq-goals.html&quot;&gt;remain focused on small hardware&lt;/a&gt;. pfSense started as a friendly fork a couple of years ago to add features and a more recent FreeBSD for those with hardware to support them. We're not talking massive hardware here... &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pfsense.com/index.php?id=43&quot;&gt;128MB RAM and CF&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://m0n0.ch/wall/hardware.php&quot;&gt;64MB RAM and 8MB CF&lt;/a&gt; for M0n0wall).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pfSense released 1.0 last fall, but my M0n0walls at home and at work have been working well, so I never looked into it. We're now considering infrasructure changes at work, and it'd be nice to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://openvpn.org/&quot;&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt; on the firewall. pfSense has it. I run the CD-ROM version of M0n0wall on an old PC at home, with settings saved on a floppy. I inserted the pfSense CD and rebooted. It took over the M0n0wall settings and just worked. Over the console I was able to copy the running system to hard disk, so I can now add packages and install updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just clicking through the interface I found a half dozen reasons to consider switching even running systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH login with standard command-line tools (mmmm, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcpdump&quot;&gt;tcpdump&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenVPN on board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliases for groups of hosts, networks and ports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add-in packages for &lt;a href=&quot;http://insecure.org/nmap/&quot;&gt;nmap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ntop.org/&quot;&gt;ntop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAT reflector (NAT addresses available from LAN, makes routing &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; simpler)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load Balancer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aliases should be real nice since I was raised on the object model in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.checkpoint.com/&quot;&gt;CheckPoint&lt;/a&gt;. One drawback of M0n0wall is that it's hard to keep the rules organized, the more intelligent aliases in pfSense should make the rules a bit more managable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning our son disappeared, and in his place a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sams-fuehrung-bamberg.de/&quot;&gt;Sams&lt;/a&gt; appeared! A Sams is a being with red hair, a short trunk-like nose, a wet suit and swim flippers, and magical blue &quot;wish dots&quot; on its face that can grant wishes. It speaks or sings mostly in rhyme and causes a great deal of chaos. It usually arrives on Saturday (&lt;em&gt;Samstag&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the star of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/s/028-8642969-6945304?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=mycroftxx1-21&amp;amp;index=blended&amp;amp;link%5Fcode=qs&amp;amp;field-keywords=das%20sams&quot;&gt;series of children's books&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Maar and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/Das-Sams-Film-Paul-Maar/dp/B000066RI9/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/Das-Sams-Gefahr-Paul-Maar/dp/B0001GAV5M/&quot;&gt;films&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow Christopher's school is celebrating &lt;a href=&quot;http://german.about.com/library/weekly/aa020501a.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fasching&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;... here are the main components of his costume. Aficionados of 20th century German children's literature can probably guess what will come of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in northern Germany &lt;em&gt;Fasching&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Karneval&lt;/em&gt; is strictly for children, unlike in lesser developed parts of the country (although some towns near us celebrate &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faslam&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faslam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to be &lt;em&gt;Karneval&lt;/em&gt; reduced to the bare essentials: getting drunk in a clown costume).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon was sunny, so we took a trip to the animal park in Nindorf so Christopher could hang out with the goats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we did pretty much &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/02/27/karneval-in-nindorf/&quot;&gt;the same thing a year ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Soundtrack of Life</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/16/soundtrack-of-life/"/>
   <updated>2007-02-16T19:43:16+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/16/soundtrack-of-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't follow every meme that comes along, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lostfocus.de/archives/2007/02/16/soundtrack-of-life/&quot;&gt;Soundtrack of Life&lt;/a&gt; that's going through our company seemed interesting, especially since I never listen to music at random. Here are the rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your player player (iTunes, Winamp, Media Player, iPod etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set it to &quot;Shuffle/Random&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &quot;Play&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each answer write the song title that's being played.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each new question hit the &quot;Next&quot; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't lie or pretend to be cool - just type the titles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result are some titles that I don't even recognize...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The First Time:&lt;br /&gt;
Nothing Really Matters - Madonna&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In the long run, no&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battle Song:&lt;br /&gt;
Leave My Monkey Alone - Warren Zevon&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Or he'll bite you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Anti-Family Policy</title>

   <updated>2007-02-15T06:30:28+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/15/anti-family-policy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some news items from Germany are just too gruesome to be translated into other languages. Take family policy. Both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2348164,00.html&quot;&gt;DW-World&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,466443,00.html&quot;&gt;Spiegel International&lt;/a&gt; will report in English on Germany's poor showing in the UNICEF study of child welfare, but the views of certain German politicians remain untranslated. But all is not lost, we will venture into the crypt, and PapaScott will explain and translate &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3261&quot;&gt;the gory details&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=domesticNews&amp;amp;storyID=2007-02-14T165037Z_01_HUM460621_RTRDEOC_0_DEUTSCHLAND-FAMILIE-UNION-2ZF.xml&quot;&gt;Berlin (Reuters)&lt;/a&gt; - In spite of the support of the CDU leadership, Family Minister is facing increasing criticism in the Union for her plan to increase day care for small children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Union parliamentary leader Volker Kauder warned against concentrating on the family model with a working mother. &quot;I think that's wrong&quot; he told the  &quot;Neuen Osnabr√ºcker Zeitung&quot;. The federal budget should also not be tapped for the financing of hundreds of thousands of day care places, as suggested by von der Leyen. That is a matter for the states. Th√ºringen CDU General Secretary Mike Mohring accused the minister of scaring away traditional Union voters. The CSU state leader in the Bundestag, Peter Ramsauer, stated that the minister does not represent the image of the family of many Union party members.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right, and these quotes are from 2007, not &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bund_Deutscher_M%C3%A4del&quot;&gt;1937&lt;/a&gt;. These politicians &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; make it difficult for women to choose both a career and a family. And then they wonder why Germany does so badly in international comparisons of child welfare and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that in half the households in Germany the woman is smarter and would have better earning potential than the man (MamaMaus would say it's more like 80%), then Germany is missing out on half (or 80%) of its current potential, not to mention the future that is being wasted by such Neanderthal views. This is not family policy, this is anti-family policy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Obama</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/12/my-obama/"/>
   <updated>2007-02-12T08:11:42+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/12/my-obama</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3254&quot;&gt;Nico notes the community website my.barackobama.com&lt;/a&gt; und wonders whether such website would be imaginable for a German candidate. He doesn't think so, and I don't either, but not for the same reasons. Nico thinks that German parties are afraid of losing control of the political process. I think that parties in general are incapable of such inter-networking. In the game of politics, in this case the issue is not the players but the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US form of representitive democracy the basic unit of politics is the individual. Political parties aren't mentioned in the constitution and evolved later (and we Americans &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Rogers#Writing&quot;&gt;don't believe in organized parties&lt;/a&gt;, at least for the Democrats). At the national level, the parties choose their candidates open and democratically, a process which is long, messy and expensive. In the German parliamentary system the party is the basic unit of politics. The parties go through great lengths to avoid choosing their leadership and candidates openly and democratically, as in the current CSU contest between Huber and Seehofer where the CSU wants to avoid an open vote at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is not whether one could imagine the possible chancellor candidates Merkel and Beck starting such websites, but whether one could have imagined (for example) the potential candidates Merkel and Stoiber starting such communities to win the CDU/CSU candidacy. Of course not. Since the electorate played no role in the decision, such a community would have been a total waste of time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I hope &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.barackobama.com/page/outreach/view/main/Nico&quot;&gt;Nico is not serious about raising money for Obama&lt;/a&gt;. Federal rules prohibit candidates from accepting contributions from individuals who are not US citizens or residents. But if he wants to contribute money to a candidate, he can send it to me and I'll be happy to pass it along.&lt;/p&gt;

In this case, 60 German tourists who had been promised Caribbean music were on a ship with 500 members of a Swiss folklore club. They were entitled to a 40% refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this could a precedent to request a partial refund of the broadcast fees we pay to the GEZ.

&lt;p&gt;Considering that cities have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_island&quot;&gt;heat island&lt;/a&gt; that raises the temperature by about 5¬∞C, it's even colder than it sounds. The coldest I've experienced was -31¬∞F on a sunny day in Minneapolis. (Minnesotans often brag about the wind chill, but I'm talking about actual temperature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, it's not that cold here. It's a balmy -2¬∞C with 5 cm of snow that will be gone by tomorrow evening.&lt;/p&gt;

  Legally, Berlin was under no obligation to protect a German-born Turkish citizen imprisoned in Guantanamo. But moral and political responsibility for a permanent resident unjustly detained is another matter, experts say.

&lt;p&gt;Um, right, like the German government is going to lift a finger for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; if I ever get in trouble.

   <title>Traction Times Ten</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/05/traction-times-ten/"/>
   <updated>2007-02-05T20:47:32+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/05/traction-times-ten</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's now been four weeks since my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/08/needles-and-pins/&quot;&gt;herniated disc was diagnosed&lt;/a&gt;, and I've gone through the first set of treatments. I'm not taking any medication, and we're trying to avoid surgery. I've been undergoing traction for my left hip and lower back, and taking acupuncture and TENS treatment for pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four weeks, I can see it's going to be a long haul. The pain relief has stagnated, and the past week I haven't been able to sleep through the night. The pain itself it dynamic, the intensity ebbs and wanes, and the epicenter seems to be moving upwards. I hope that's a sign of healing, that the pain is moving to it's true source in the spinal column. This weekend for the first time I felt discomfort in my back for the first time. Until now the pain has only been in my hip and legs. I'm fine when I standing, it's when sitting and laying down that the pain occurs. Waking up in the morning (or the middle of the night, as the case may be) it takes 30 minutes to an hour for the pain to subside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll continue the chiropractic traction treatments, they are what seem do the most good. I'm not sure about the acupuncture. I'm not sure TENS actually relieves pain or just distracts from it, but I guess on the whole it helps. I can see this is going to be a process of months and not weeks, and I'm glad our orthopedist is just a 5 minute drive. I'm also very glad I work at home... an hour drive twice a day would be pure torture.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2007-02-04T03:22:36+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/02/04/bring-slippers-to-school</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://serendipita.org/2007/02/03/welche-schule/&quot;&gt;Andrea pointed out an article&lt;/a&gt; in Die Zeit on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zeit.de/2007/06/Schule-Marie?page=all&quot;&gt;journalist's experience with his daughter's first grade class&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin, and how much has changed since was in first grade. I could identify a lot with Christopher's experience. He also is learning letters phonetically, incorrect spelling is ignored for now, and he also has slippers at school. Unlike in the article, his class has a number (1c) not a name and he has to practice writing block letters like in the old days. His school has a 'family class' with grades 1-4 in one room, but he's in a traditional class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find learning reading phonetically to be fascinating. For example, their newest letter is 'H', which is called &quot;huh&quot; (whisphered) and not &quot;aitch&quot; (or &quot;haw&quot; as it would be in German). They also learn gestures for each letter to associate with the sound. For 'H' it is putting both hands in front of your mouth (as if you were blowing on your hands on a cold day). One day he and the neighbor girl were spelling words with gestures, and it looked like they were hula dancing. The phonetic system probably works only because the phonetics in German are consistent. I can't imagine learning English this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher is not into writing out words like the girl in the article. He's more into building and drawing. His career goal at the moment is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=vacant&amp;amp;contentid=27719&quot;&gt;design new figures for the Lego Group&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/uploaded2583ca-5e05-4bd5-a003-ff36968c9bb8.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better, today his school lets out at 10 am, after exactly 90 minutes in class. So working parents lose 3 days instead of 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That din you'll be hearing in the background is the sound of somewhat more chaos than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Airline Crap Shoot 2007</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/30/airline-crap-shoot-2007/"/>
   <updated>2007-01-30T07:36:26+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/30/airline-crap-shoot-2007</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've flown between Hamburg and Minneapolis (either starting from there or starting from here) pretty much every year for the past 25 years. We'll be doing it again this summer. And we know the choices better than any travel agent or web site. There are no direct flights, there haven't been since the '80s. If you want one stop, you either have to fly direct Hamburg to North America (currently Continental or Emirates) or Minneapolis to Europe (Northwest or Northwest). My wife collects hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miles-and-more.com/&quot;&gt;Lufthansa miles&lt;/a&gt;, but usually they don't help us much (this year the closest they could get us was Newark).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also would like to avoid an extra stop in the US if you can, since US Immigration is a risk factor. If you can't avoid it, you should allow at least 3 hours between flights. We've missed connections and had luggage delayed by cutting the connections too close. That would have limited our options to Northwest. They were OK last year, but the flights with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/08/18/back-again/&quot;&gt;old DC-10s&lt;/a&gt; were somewhat cramped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, though, we remembered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icelandair.com/&quot;&gt;Icelandair&lt;/a&gt; also flies to Minneapolis. The regular travel sites wouldn't show us Icelandair flights, since there's no good way to get from Hamburg to Reykjavik. But flying from Frankfurt was 4 hours shorter than any other flight we checked (just 1 hour layover at Keflavik), the cost was several hundred Euros less than the other flights, and we have all those Lufthansa miles to get to Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flew Icelandair once to Florida, and we were quite impressed. We promised ourselves to fly with them again if it were practical. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airport.is/english/menu/facilities/facility_map/&quot;&gt;Keflavik&lt;/a&gt; is a small airport, so transfers are easy. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icelandair.com/home/travel-information/in-flight/seat-map/&quot;&gt;they fly 757s&lt;/a&gt;, with rows only 6 across. We're guaranteed to sit together, with a window seat for Christopher, and noone will get stuck in the middle aisle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Iceland here we come (for one hour). We've got 2 stops and have to fly through the Monster Maze in Frankfurt, but the shorter total time, the smaller planes, and the quick transfer in Reykjavik should make for a good flight.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.onezblog.de/item/250&quot;&gt;Soeren asked me&lt;/a&gt; what I would consider the best albums of all time or most important to me. I decided both &quot;best&quot; and &quot;important&quot; were uninteresting (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/500albums&quot;&gt;best&lt;/a&gt; has already been done). I decided to list &quot;favorite&quot; instead, albums I like and listen to, even though they may not be the best, and maybe next week my list would be different. I did limit myself to one pick per artist. In order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dirty Mind, Prince&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rocket to Russia, Ramones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Born to Run, Bruce Springsteen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;London Calling, The Clash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making Movies, Dire Straits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achtung Baby, U2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk Show, Go-Go's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planet Punk, Die √Ñrzte&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, Peter Gabriel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He listed nine, so I did too (though the 9th was the hardest to pick). For the moment I won't explain my choices, maybe later. Feel free to tell me in the comments why my picks suck.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I resumed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stern.de/weinschule&quot;&gt;Stern wine school&lt;/a&gt;, which I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/16/wine-school/&quot;&gt;started last week&lt;/a&gt;, on the night of the big storm last Thursday. The next lesson was another Bordeaux, this one a price class higher. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/kueche/getraenke/580331.html?eid=580464&quot;&gt;2004 Dutruch&lt;/a&gt; costs ¬Ä20, so I wasn't greatly disappointed that my first impression was that it was way too bitter for my taste. I certainly did not detect the aroma of tea leaves, tobacco or pencil shavings mentioned by Messrs. Lange and Lange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unforunately for my wallet the Dutruch tasted much better the next day, after I had left the remaining half-bottle corked at room temperature overnight. I guess I should take the temperature recommendations and the suggestion that it be decanted more seriously. The price is too rich for for me for everyday consumption, but I could see keep a few bottles in the basement (or in the closet, as the Langes suggest) for special occasions. It's supposed to only get better for the next 3 to 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next wine is also from Bordeaux, this time a fresh white wine. It doesn't seem right for January, but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That Hillary Clinton is running for President is about as surprising as the Pope being Catholic or the bear shitting in the woods, but the German press isn't very well informed on US politics, so she's been the big news here for past day. Her picture even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.welt.de/data/2007/01/20/1184167.html&quot;&gt;made the the front page&lt;/a&gt; of the conservative Welt am Sonntag (which we only read for the real estate ads). The online edition is even running a story about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.welt.de/data/2007/01/21/1184198.html&quot;&gt;Hillary's alter-ego&lt;/a&gt;, so I guess they're paying some attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course to truly make sense of American politics we have to turn to an analyst like Scott Adams, who today &lt;a href=&quot;http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/01/flipflopper_sea.html&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; why we punish politicians for acting rational and why he already feels good about a Clinton/Obama ticket.

Were it not for bad weather that brought on the Elbe floods in 2002, we could be very well be at the beginning of the second term of a Stoiber chancellorship.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The magazine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stern.de/&quot;&gt;Stern&lt;/a&gt; is publishing a 24-week long &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stern.de/weinschule&quot;&gt;wine course&lt;/a&gt;, offering a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rindchen.de/main.php?typ=K&amp;amp;seite=sternweinschule&quot;&gt;package of 24 wines&lt;/a&gt; by post from Rindchen with an article in the print magazine and an online forum. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://drinktank.blogg.de/&quot;&gt;The Drink Tank&lt;/a&gt; (hosted by my employer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogg.de/&quot;&gt;blogg.de&lt;/a&gt;) over &lt;a href=&quot;http://drinktank.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=1682&quot;&gt;6000 packages have been shipped&lt;/a&gt;, including one to yours truly. I'm a little late to the game. I just opened &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/kueche/getraenke/579959.html?eid=580464&quot;&gt;wine number one&lt;/a&gt; and this is already week 3. I have a feeling this is not the kind of class where you want to catch up on your studies all at once (especially since MamaMaus is a beer drinker, therefore I have to study alone). As for the week one Bordeaux, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/kueche/getraenke/579959.html?eid=580464&quot;&gt;2005 Camarsac&lt;/a&gt; is nice for under 10 Euros, but I don't smell the berries, and certainly not the cougar cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice marketing gag... we usually don't read Stern but now we (or least I) will be reading every week until mid-June for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Health Care Here and There</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/12/health-care-here-and-there/"/>
   <updated>2007-01-12T19:11:46+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/12/health-care-here-and-there</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Economist blog Free Exchange on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/debate/freeexchange/2007/01/crosscountry_perceptions.cfm&quot;&gt;perceptions of health care&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Talking to Europeans (particularly non-Brits) about things like health care and welfare programmes is a treat.  Most of the Europeans I meet seem to believe that huge numbers of Americans get no health care at all, while the rich few wallow in luxury.  In fact, the biggest problems uninsured Americans face are not doctors refusing to treat them, but the fact that they use the incredibly inconvenient emergency room for most of their care, and that a really bad illness could force them into bankruptcy....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Americans on the other hand, the overwhelming majority of whom are insured, seem to believe that millions of Europeans die each year from lack of treatment.  The reality is much less grim; a fair number of Europeans go without hip replacements and other quality of life treatments, and some do die on waiting lists, but many of those people would have died anyway, because they have nasty diseases with life expectancies measured in months.  America caters, expensively, to their desire to live a few extra weeks or months; Europe does not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality lies somewhere in between the extremes, as for most things. Germany seems to least avoid the worth of both worlds. Coverage is pretty universal, and waiting lists are rare. But health care reform has been discussed for decades. Today the coalition agreed for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,459357,00.html&quot;&gt;third time on a compromise reform package&lt;/a&gt;, without ever having presented the first two to the Bundestag. It saves times and paper, I guess, when you shoot down your own proposals before they are formally proposed. My current experience with the health care system is a reminder of the different levels of care for public and privately insured (the public patients get to sign all sorts of waivers and pay cash for treatments that aren't covered, the private patients are waved on through).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess like &lt;a href=&quot;http://alwinism.org/&quot;&gt;Alwin&lt;/a&gt; always said, with health care you have 3 options. Cheap, fast, or good. Pick any two.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2007/01/08/needles-and-pins</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/06/pinch-my-grits/&quot;&gt;first talked about my back pain&lt;/a&gt; last month, I had just seen our family doctor and was going to wait a week to see whether the prescription would make things better. The pain improved somewhat, so I didn't go to the orthopedist right away. But it didn't go away either. The pain in my left leg was less intense, but was more persistent. I skipped the pain pills some days, and they didn't seem to make much difference. Over Christmas it was clear to me that more help was needed, and I went to the orthopedist last Thursday, the same doctor who got MamaMaus up and running so quickly after her accident in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He bent my legs a couple of times, took some x-rays, and was fairly certain I had a herniated disc. He put me on his standard 5-point program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.painreliever.com/lumbotrain.html&quot;&gt;lumbotrain bandage&lt;/a&gt; to support my lower back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buffered heels to be installed in my shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation&quot;&gt;TENS&lt;/a&gt; (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) pain treatment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lumbar and cervical traction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; (magnetic resonance imaging), with a possible &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computed_tomography&quot;&gt;ct&lt;/a&gt;-guided periradicular injection (PRT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spine-health.com/topics/cd/overview/lumbar/young/lum01.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/herniated_lumbar_disc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Herniated Lumbar Disc&quot; title=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The MRI and possible PRT were scheduled for today. I wasn't too keen on having a needle inserted in to my spine, and I approached the appointment with no small amount of anxiety and lost sleep. I haven't been in the hospital since having my tonsils removed at age 8. My most serious medical problem since then was a broken thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a radiology clinic in Hamburg for the MRI. I spent 10 minutes in a tight tube with flashing lights and loud pounding (rather like a techno show), and within minutes the radiologist showed me a 3 mm extrusion from my L5-S1 vertebrae (very much like the picture &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spine-health.com/topics/cd/overview/lumbar/young/lum01.html&quot;&gt;here (Fig. 2)&lt;/a&gt;). We proceeded immediately to the PRT (my orthopedist is conveniently at the radiologist on Monday afternoons). My fear of the injection was totally unfounded. An initial scan to mark the point, an initial injection, an additional scan to confirm the position, and the injection was finished. I felt almost nothing, and the doctor said his aim was perfect. Within 20 minutes 90% of my pain was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My traction and TENS treatments begin tomorrow, and I'll have my shoes by the end of the week. It's vital that I lose weight, and I'll have to watch out for my back for the rest of my life. But for this evening I'm looking forward to the best night's sleep I've had in weeks. If anyone is looking for an orthopedist (sports specialist and chiropractor) located south of Hamburg, we both can highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=arzt+al-hassani+jesteburg&quot;&gt;Dr. Al-Hassani in Jesteburg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Tinti, Netzi and Nepomuk, an octopus, spider, and dragon that Christopher freed from Ikea yesterday. His shopping was more successful than mine. The shelves I brought home were the wrong color (birch instead of beech).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The box and the styrofoam peanuts were a late Christmas package from Arizona, and were more fun than any toy.&lt;/p&gt;

Fine, I can add &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/user/nixande&quot;&gt;her&lt;/a&gt; to my list of contacts... but the playlists on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/user/papascott&quot;&gt;my profile&lt;/a&gt; don't really reflect what I like to listen to. Here are &quot;my&quot; &quot;Favorite Artists&quot; from last week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are all childrens' stories and music. Christopher had school vacation, and he got a lot of new CDs for Christmas and his birthday. I ripped them all into my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html&quot;&gt;Squeezebox&lt;/a&gt;, and we listened to them all. And, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://slimscrobbler.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;scrobbler plugin for the Squeezebox&lt;/a&gt; sent all the titles to last.fm. Good thing MamaMaus has never learned to use the Squeezebox, otherwise my taste would be even more skewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess lists like my last.fm profile or my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/&quot;&gt;recommendations from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are too stupid to realize when I'm listening (or buying) for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Decategorization</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/29/decategorization/"/>
   <updated>2006-12-29T20:39:04+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/29/decategorization</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/my_google_reader_tags.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my google reader tags&quot; title=&quot;my google reader tags&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while ago I figured out that the websites I follow via RSS feeds fall into 3 categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites I want to read as quickly as possible when there is something new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites where I don't want to miss anything, but without any time pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sites where I want to see what's current, but don't mind missing old news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, for some sites I want to keep archives, but for others not. I couldn't figure out how to configure my RSS readers to do that, be it Net News Wire or Bloglines... until a couple days ago I figured it out for Google Reader. The key is that Google Reader allows you to assign feeds to multiple folders (or, to use their terminology, assign several default tags to single feeds). It is also quite easy to change folders for a couple of hundred feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of 50 different folders based on theme and geography, I now have 4 main folders based on priority: readfirst, readsecond, readthird, and no-archive. readfirst are the top priority feeds I read right away... sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/&quot;&gt;lumma.de&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/&quot;&gt;vowe dot net&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/&quot;&gt;Overheard in New York&lt;/a&gt;. readsecond and readthird tend to be personal weblogs, tech and german weblogs in readsecond, us political weblogs in readthird. no-archive are news sites and prolific personal sites... I try to scan all headlines, but have no qualms about hitting 'mark all as read' for the folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have 2 or 3 themed folders for groups I want to follow (fellow expats, co-workers, old EditThisPage bloggers), but they're all in readsecond as well. So I can read them either as a group or together with the rest of the feeds. My own feeds (which I read only for testing purposes) also have their own category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My impression after a couple of days is that I'm reading more efficiently now, although perhaps the week between Christmas and New Year is not a good test.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(writing in all lower-case is xenophobic!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to air one of my pet peeves onto the Internets... it's hard enough to read websites in a foreign language. It becomes damned near impossible when the author deliberately ignore capitalization and punctuation and uses creative spelling. One of my colleagues writes in such a style (for example, he spells &quot;Berlin&quot; lower-case with a y). I cannot read his weblog at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when we invented blogging we tried to follow the principles of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sexyjazz.de/world/d2k/&quot;&gt;Dogma 2000&lt;/a&gt;, where we would not obsess over grammar and spelling. The flip side (as in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20001202025800/netdyslexia.editthispage.com/dogma2000&quot;&gt;original Dogma 2000&lt;/a&gt;) is &quot;do not make mistakes on purpose&quot; and &quot;no intellectual capitals or other strange letter substitutions&quot;. Don't deliberately make your writing hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are funky tests where you can leave out half the letters in your words because most reading is done unconsciously. That only applies to native speakers of your language. Foreign readers need the hooks of proper grammar and spelling to be able to read your words. Don't lock us out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is perfectly OK to make obscure cultural references that only a native could understand. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tvacres.com/admascots_bartles.htm&quot;&gt;We thank you for your support.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher in the snow. His Christmas wish came true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not completely true. He actually wished for 2 meters of snow, like we had in Austria last year. He won't get that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Update** It's not going to last long. It's afternoon and the snow is already melting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's probably been around forever, but I just found that our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html&quot;&gt;SqueezeBox&lt;/a&gt; music player includes a geographic list of online radio stations from &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiotime.com/&quot;&gt;RadioGuide&lt;/a&gt;. So if you want to pretend you are in &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiotime.com/region/c_100016/Minneapolis-St_Paul.aspx&quot;&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiotime.com/region/c_100015/Phoenix.aspx&quot;&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://radiotime.com/region/c_100766/Hamburg.aspx&quot;&gt;Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; or any other place you used to live, you can at least get the soundtrack right (if you can deal with the time difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent the evening listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cities97.com/&quot;&gt;Cities97&lt;/a&gt;, just like we did back in the 80s. Back then &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTCZ&quot;&gt;their adult contemporary format&lt;/a&gt; was revolutionary. These days they're owned by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Channel_Communications&quot;&gt;ClearChannel&lt;/a&gt;, but they sound remarkably like I remember them in the '80s. It must be the new retro.&lt;/p&gt;

A few times a week the database, and thus the blog,  has been slow and unavailable for a few minutes.

   <title>Free education is elitist</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/13/free-education-is-elitist/"/>
   <updated>2006-12-13T02:43:52+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/13/free-education-is-elitist</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is free education more elitist than requiring tuition fees? This piece from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/debate/freeexchange/2006/12/yesterdays_new_york_times_spec.cfm&quot;&gt;Free Exchange&lt;/a&gt; is worth a long quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Until recently, only a small minority in most Western European nations received any post secondary education, even though tuition was low or free in most places.  Ironically, the ideal of free education forced the government to institute rationing through non-price mechanisms, in this case by limiting the number of spaces at university.  Wealthier children were more likely to get the high exam scores necessary to secure one of these scarce slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Recently, these countries have tried to make higher education more widely available. Unfortunately, they have tried to do so on the cheap.  This has put a tremendous strain on the resources of these universities, and as a result many talented professors have decamped to America. But the mere mention of instituting or increasing fees incites mass demonstrations of students, who believe the only fair education is free education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  However, fee paying education does not seem to discourage attendance. According the National Centre for Public Policy and Higher Education, 39% of Americans between the ages of 35 to 64 hold a college degree, just behind Canada. This figure is only 25% in the UK, 23% in Germany, 19% in France, and 10% in Italy. They are shrinking towards par in the current generation, but there is no sign that free education is making Europeans more likely to attend college.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking from experience, as a student money for education is a solvable problem... loans, part-time jobs, scholarships, or even joining the military. There are ways around it. But there is no way around not getting a spot in the first place because universities are underfunded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend in Germany right now is to start charging modest fees to students without actually increasing budgets, the quality of education or the number of students. In other words, it's the worst of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Could Those Be Angels?</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/12/could-those-be-angels/"/>
   <updated>2006-12-12T18:37:36+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/12/could-those-be-angels</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've come to the conclusion that since the 4th Advent Sunday falls on Christmas Eve, Christmas is coming way too soon this year. We'd like to apply for a week's extension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher has school up to Friday the 22nd, but his special activities (tumbling at school and stutter therapy) have the week before Christmas off, so he has extra time to get excited for Christmas. We adults do not. He's also signed up for the Christmas program at church. He was in a nativity play in Kindergarten last year, playing one of the main roles, Joseph. As a special ed Kindergarten, Mary was in a wheelchair, so he had to both speak lines and push Mary to the stage. This year he's happy to play a supporting role, namely a shepherd. He's got one line, with exactly 6 words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; And there! Could those be angels!? *(Und da! Sind das nicht Engel!?)*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was able to borrow a shepherd's staff (actually just a big stick) from church. We need to organize the rest of the costume (floppy hat, vest, dark pants) ourselves. We also have to bring him to dress rehearsal on Saturday the 23rd, which takes care of any last minute shopping we might need to do. We also need to show up early for church on Christmas Eve, but at least we should get good seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if he stutters well enough, he could well double his speaking part! (Yes, it's okay to joke about stuttering. We do it with Christopher all the time. He stutters with all kinds of frogs, sometimes with snakes, and sometimes even with a lawn mower that runs backwards! *Der r√ºckwarts Rasenm√§her! R-r-r-r-r-r-r!*)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pinch My Grits</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/06/pinch-my-grits/"/>
   <updated>2006-12-06T05:50:11+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/06/pinch-my-grits</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Or in which PapaScott learns first hand of the frailty of bones, tendons and joints in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the entire fall I've been dealing with aches and pains of one sort or another. In October it was my right shoulder. It would twinge when I would twist it a certain way (for instance, when backing out of a parking space I reach twist around to look out the back) or when sleeping on my right side. I hadn't injured myself as far as I could remember (altuough thinking back now, it was about that time when I carted off a couple cubic meters of dirt from a pile in the backyard). It seemed to appear by itself, and I hoped it would go away by itself as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks later the pain was still there and it wasn't getting any better, so I finally went to the doctor. I really dislike going to the doctor. For one thing it seems to be such a waste of time to take 2 to 3 hours of my time for a 5 minute office visit. For another I don't like trying to describe ambiguous things like pain in a foreign language. When it comes to anatomy, my German vocabulary fails me and I feel like I'm reduced to pointing and grunting. It has nothing to do with our family doctor himself. He's nice and friendly and knows me by name, which might have something to do with the fact that I'm privately insured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, he diagnosed &quot;Periarthritis humeroscapularis&quot; (which I think is Latin for shoulder pain) and prescribed ibuprofin and some toxic metamizol drops. If it wasn't better in a few days, I was to see a specialist for a cortisone shot (to get an immediate appointment, I was to utter the magic words &quot;privately insured&quot;). It did get better, but wasn't completely gone. The thought of a needle in my shoulder doesn't thrill me at all, so I haven't gone in for the shot yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime it's November and a new stabbing pain appeared in my left leg. I first noticed it getting up in the morning, so I thought maybe it was a compensation for no longer sleeping on my shoulder. I didn't notice it at all when standing or walking, but it was there when sitting, and would shoot from my hip down the back of my leg when standing up, when stepping on the clutch when driving, or getting out of the car. It didn't get any better, instead after a couple weeks it seemed to be getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst day was last Friday, when between taking the train to Hamburg, sitting at the children's theatre, going out to eat, then riding home I was on my butt for nearly 5 hours straight. I complained a little bit too loudly, and MamaMaus declared she would drag me to the emergency room first thing in the morning. &quot;But our family doctor has office hours on Saturday.&quot; &quot;No, he'd just give you pain pills and send you home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on Saturday morning I was at the emergency room. I waited an hour for the intern, who diagnosed a pinched sciatic nerve (&lt;em&gt;Ischiasnerv&lt;/em&gt;). He gave me some pain pills (Arthotec and tetrazepam, just enough for the weekend) and sent me home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pills worked, but by Monday they were gone and I headed to my doctor to get a real prescription. But the doctor wasn't in. Monday was a national doctors' and pharmacists' strike to protest the proposed health care reform, and the practice was closed. With tears in my eyes, I searched for pharmacy that was open, and asked for something over-the-counter that was similar to Arthotec. That got me through to Tuesday, when my regular doctor was back in. He told me how evil Ulla Schmidt (German Health Minister, author of the health care reform) is and gave me a proper prescription. If it's not better in a few days, I'm to see a specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I've done some reading on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spine-health.com/topics/cd/d_sciatica/sc01.html&quot;&gt;sciatica&lt;/a&gt;, so I know the problem is in my lower back, and that it's a fairly common problem for men between 30 and 50. It will probably go away in a few weeks, anti-inflammatory medication helps, but I'm going to have to pay close attention to my back from now on. I'll have to set up a proper workspace here at home (the MacBook on the kitchen table is handy for watching Christopher, but is murder for the back), take frequent breaks and take plenty of walks. That's all stuff I should be doing anyway, but now I have a constant reminder in my thigh.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;J decided that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbittner.com/germany/2006/12/4-december-2006-is-christmas-market.html&quot;&gt;tomorrow would be Christmas Market Monday&lt;/a&gt;, when we all post pictures from our visits to our local Christmas Markets this past weekend. I usually don't go along with special blogging days, but since we were meeting Oma at the Christmas Market in Buchholz anyway, I brought my camera along. Just to be a non-conformist, I'm posting mine a day early. There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/detail7&quot;&gt;set at flickr&lt;/a&gt;, and a slideshow &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/show/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I tried to tell a story with the captions, so maybe the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594403825079/detail/&quot;&gt;plain view&lt;/a&gt; is better than the slideshow (where you have to click on each picture to see the caption).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been funnier to go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hamburg.de/event.do?cid=6513353&quot;&gt;&quot;Santa Pauli&quot; Christmas Market&lt;/a&gt; on Spielbudenplatz, which features booths from FC St. Pauli and a various sex shops, since we were in the area on Friday. Actually not, since it was so blatantly commercial and was most definately inappropriate for children. We didn't stop.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2006-12-03T06:48:09+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/03/ronald-schill-please-come-home</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's almost like old times... Hamburg's ex-Interior Senator, Judge Merciless, and all-around bad guy Ronald Barnabas Schill is back in the news. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,452123,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Gesuchter Zeuge: Ex-Senator Schill zur Fahndung ausgeschrieben - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten&quot;&gt;Spiegel Online&lt;/a&gt;, he's wanted by the police! Only as a witness (Honest. We swear!), though, for an old political juvenile justice scandal. Ronnie's hanging out in Brazil, last we heard, so it's doubtful that he'll be showing up for any special committee hearings anytime soon. But it's the thought that counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's that thought that reminds us of the good old days of politics in Hamburg. Sure, we have another jilted Senator who's &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeimatHamburg&quot;&gt;started his own party&lt;/a&gt;. And we have one-party government that's testing the edge of constitutionality. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mehr-demokratie-hamburg.de/&quot;&gt;Citizen's initiative?&lt;/a&gt; We don't like it, we'll just abolish it.) But without the bad man on his side, Ole von Beust is, simply put, boring. (If Berlin's Klaus Wowereit is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/wowereits-berlin-slogan_nid_37712.html&quot; title=&quot;http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/wowereits-berlin-slogan_nid_37712.html&quot;&gt;&quot;poor but sexy&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, then von Beust is, well, neither.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the national level, bad boy Roland Koch has been whipped by Angela Merkel so much he's now a girlie man (so much so that the SPD is sending a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,452154,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Kochs Herausfordererin: S√©gol√®ne Ypsilanti - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten&quot;&gt;girlie girl&lt;/a&gt; against him in 2008). When the times of the grand coalition are such that the CDU spends an entire convention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dresden2006.cdu.de/&quot;&gt;pretending to put on a human face&lt;/a&gt;, it's no wonder that that disinterest in politics is at an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg needs you. Germany needs you. Ronald Schill, please come home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to see the musical version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://tivoli.de/index.php?id=event843&quot;&gt;Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivfuhrer&lt;/a&gt; at the Schmidt Theatre in Hamburg yesterday. As you can see, Christopher was very happy to have his picture (a scan of a polaroid) taken with the star. We can highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, here's the annual Christmas Cookie Cutter picture.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Major Medical Breakthrough</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/01/major-medical-breakthrough/"/>
   <updated>2006-12-01T05:07:24+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/12/01/major-medical-breakthrough</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a breakthrough for German medicine, researchers have revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;http://claireseuroamerica.blogspot.com/2006/11/small-victories.html&quot;&gt;cold kidneys do not cause disease&lt;/a&gt;. This has the potential to save millions for the German health care system, as until now it has been thought that cold kidneys are the second leading cause of death in Germany, just ahead of being exposed to drafts and behind the number one killer, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,416475,00.html&quot; title=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,416475,00.html&quot;&gt;range of circulatory disorders&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;em&gt;Kreislaufkollaps&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into these conditions has been all the more difficult as they seem only to occur in Germany, and only to afflict native-born Germans. Finding cures could give hope that Germans could achieve of level of health on par with that of the rest of the world, although it would also eliminate the number one topic of conversation in the country. Discussion would then have to resort to other subjects such as other people's poor driving and the condition of the neighbors' gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A note to my British readers: cold kidney is a fictitious medical condition, and not something you eat.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first of December approaches and the first Sunday in Advent, I thought we would share this envelope we received in the mail that pictures the perfect family Christmas... in our worst nightmare! If these children show up at your house, have the parents arrested for child abuse.

   <title>Bringing Big Bucks By Blogging</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/29/bringing-big-bucks-by-blogging/"/>
   <updated>2006-11-29T08:43:37+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/29/bringing-big-bucks-by-blogging</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while ago I reactivated Google AdSense on PapaScott. I've never had much success with AdSense, my revenue barely covered the cost of maintaining the weblog (since our employers cover our phone and DSL costs, and my web hoster is prepaid, the running cost of PapaScott is close to zero). I'm not going to make any radical changes to PapaScott (like, say, writing interesting content) just to increase ad revenue. I did run my URL one time through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adsblacklist.com/&quot;&gt;AdsBlackList&lt;/a&gt; to filter out low-paying ads, and that seemed to work as advertised. My revenue doubled... from barely $10 a month to barely $20. Nothing to get too excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I signed up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.text-link-ads.com/&quot;&gt;Text Link Ads (TLA)&lt;/a&gt;. They sell static links (which can co-exist with AdSense) and pay out 50% of the revenue. You need to be able to add some code to your blog template, so it won't work for a lot of hosters (like BlogSpot). I was shocked to see that they priced my links at $125 each. I was even more shocked when the first two links sold almost immediately. As you can see in the sidebar under &quot;Sponsored Links&quot;, I'm currently at six, so you can figure out my revenue yourself. Let's just say it's time for me to consider the tax implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've even had a couple of websites contact me asking if I would sell links or posts directly. No, I don't, the idea is that I don't want to do any work, that's why TLA can keep 50%. But if you want to buy a link, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.text-link-ads.com/packageDetail.php?packageID=44793&quot;&gt;check out my listing&lt;/a&gt; at TLA. I just opened two more slots, for a limited time only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's face it, the advertisers are buying the links so they can game Google. With PapaScott they get links from over 4000 pages dating back to 1999 with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webworkshop.net/pagerank.html&quot;&gt;PageRank&lt;/a&gt; of 7 out of 10 (top 20 blogs like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boingboing.net&quot;&gt;BoingBoing&lt;/a&gt; might have a PR of 8, you can also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prchecker.info/check_page_rank.php&quot;&gt;check any site's page rank&lt;/a&gt;). The links are valuable not because actual people see them, but because they get followed by search engines. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://technorati.com/blogs/http://www.papascott.de&quot;&gt;Technorati rank&lt;/a&gt; is about 63,000, which is impressive only if you believe there are really 55 million weblogs. There aren't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does selling links dilute the value of search engines? Of course it does, but search engines are not a public good. They're big business, earning money from our content, and I have nothing against skimming a little off the top. I don't approve the ads myself, by the way, they just have to meet TLA's guidelines. No sex, drugs or casinos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting to see that when selling links, language matters. I noticed a couple of top German blogs (&lt;a href=&quot;http://powerbook.blogger.de/&quot;&gt;Powerbook Blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basicthinking.de/blog/&quot;&gt;Basic Thinking&lt;/a&gt;) listed at Text Link Ads with prices well below $100. I don't know of any German blogs with a Page Rank higher than 6. So when &lt;a href=&quot;http://crueltobekind.org/&quot;&gt;Nicole&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;a href=&quot;http://beissholz.de/i&quot;&gt;noone will read you if you blog in German&lt;/a&gt;, she's right. Try Chinese or Korean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've got a heat wave for the end of November. Today was 13¬∞C (mid 50s¬∞F), sunny with a mild breeze. The grass is still green, and the air even smells fresh. It could be springtime, if it weren't for all the leaves on the ground to rake. We &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594392567520/&quot;&gt;took a walk&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon to appreciate the spring air...

   <title>Impressions from Munich</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/23/impressions-from-munich/"/>
   <updated>2006-11-23T20:55:10+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/23/impressions-from-munich</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama and I were in Munich for a 25 hours last weekend. I hadn't been in Munich for a few years, here are a few impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't people have anything better to do than walk down the Neuhauser Stra√üe? I know it's the main pedestrian street town, but it was jam packed every time we were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We each bought shoes on the Neuhauser Stra√üe, since everyone knows you can't buy shoes in Hamburg. (Inside family joke, ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naturheilzentrumdrochtersen.de/&quot;&gt;Kirsten&lt;/a&gt;. The punch line, by the way, is &quot;Kassel&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw lots of good food at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dallmayr.de/&quot;&gt;Dallmayr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feinkost-kaefer.de/&quot;&gt;K√§fer&lt;/a&gt; and the Viktualienmarkt, but we didn't buy any. We were tempted by some cheeses, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also heard a lot of foreign languages on the street. I don't mean German dialects like Bavarian or Swabian or familiar foreign languages like we hear in Hamburg (Russian, Turkish, etc.), but languages I don't hear every day like Italian and American English. I'd always thought of Munich as a German ghetto, maybe I've been wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our formal gala event was held in a riding hall which had been converted to a event center. Around here we still have horses, and riding halls are used for, well, riding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidi Klum was supposed to show up but she was too pregnant. She sent a video, though. The a cappella group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.n7house.de/&quot;&gt;Naturally7&lt;/a&gt; performed, and they were quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolute highlight were the beds at the hotel. We have never slept so well as at the Hotel Sofitel. Their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sofitel.com/sofitel/gb/mybed/index.shtml&quot;&gt;MyBed&lt;/a&gt; is so good they even &lt;a href=&quot;http://eu.soboutique-hotelsathome.com/EN/mybed.html&quot;&gt;sell the complete MyBed&lt;/a&gt; on the internet, should you want to drop a couple of thousand Euros on a bed. We're tempted to at least buy the pillows and the featherbed. It was that good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Closed on Thanksgiving</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/23/closed-on-thanksgiving</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there's one thing you can say that applies to all Americans, it's that you can't say anything that applies to all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is Thanksgiving in the States, but it's not a holiday that I particularly miss. Yes, as a child we celebrated Thanksgiving with a turkey dinner like everyone does, and no, I had no particularly traumatic experiences associated with Thanksgiving. But for me, Christmas was always the highlight of the year. Thanksgiving was more of a &lt;abbr title=&quot;White Anglo-Saxon Protestant&quot;&gt;WASP&lt;/abbr&gt; thing, and as Scandinavians, we came a couple of centuries late to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest memories of Thanksgiving are a couple of extremely cold bus rides home from college for the long weekend, once in a blizzard, and another time in a blizzard during a bus drivers' strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe tonight I'll bring home a some roast turkey cold cuts to enjoy with our German &lt;em&gt;Abendbrot&lt;/em&gt;. Happy Thanksgiving, and remember, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arlo.net/resources/lyrics/alices.shtml&quot;&gt;dump is closed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Pig Revisited</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/23/the-pig-revisited/"/>
   <updated>2006-11-23T06:07:05+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/23/the-pig-revisited</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My brief note about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/19/we-got-the-pig&quot;&gt;return of Floyd of Rosedale&lt;/a&gt; to it's rightful home in Minneapolis attracted a few comments, along with a note from my boss that &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=3110&quot;&gt;Iowa is now wine country&lt;/a&gt; so it no longer needs a bronze pig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minnesota football is traditionally mediocre at best, and the Golden Gophers usually can't fight their way out of a paper bag. This year was no different, the Gophers were heading for a losing record until they won their last 3 Big 10 games. Back in the day, 3 Big 10 wins and 6th place was a poor season. These days it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/news;_ylt=ArFP4yUYfihrrdJK8t4wQ6if1LYF?slug=ap-minnesota-insightbowl&amp;amp;prov=ap&amp;amp;type=lgns&quot;&gt;good enough for a bowl game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The U' is unique for big public colleges in that it's in the middle of the city, a stone's throw from downtown Minneapolis, and thus school spirit is at a level more fitting for a community college than the Big 10. To make things worse, for the past 20 years home football games are played off campus in a sterile concrete bunker with a plastic roof (the Metrodome). That's been a failure, the University has started constructing a new outdoor stadium on campus. It's too bad they tore down the old one. I distinctly remember the last Gopher football game I saw at the Metrodome. Nebraska came to town, and held the Gophers scoreless. The Cornhuskers scored 3 touchdowns... in each and every quarter. That 84-0, for those who are math challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when Iowa comes to town it's different. In Minnesota we tend to think of Iowa as our less-cultured southern neighbor, and when 30000 Iowa football fans come to the big city with pigs on their heads and mud (or worse) on their shoes, it only reinforces the stereotype. They outdo the Gopher fans in numbers, enthusiasm and volume, so it's like another home game for them. And Iowa usually wins, but not this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/11/14_steilm_floydofrosedale/&quot;&gt;story of Floyd of Rosedale&lt;/a&gt; recalls a day when things were different, when college football mattered in Minnesota and the Gophers were a national powerhouse. It's also likely the first anti-racism trophy in sports.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Interruptible Power Supply</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/19/interruptible-power-supply/"/>
   <updated>2006-11-19T08:09:38+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/19/interruptible-power-supply</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I take time off from work, disasters seem to happen at a rate of about 50%. One time it was a friendly developer who started a script that brought a server to its knees, another time it was a l33t haxx0r (that's pond scum in plain English). Or a database suddenly becomes too big for its britches and its CPU. Last year when I was the only admin at nu2m I was a lot more concerned about such things, but that that there are 4 of us we should be covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe we're as far as skill and experience are concerned but not with luck. I took Friday off to accompany my lovely wife to a gala dinner in Munich. (Heidi Klum was supposed to be there, but she's still too pregnant.) We're in our 5-star hotel, we have to leave in 30 minutes, I'm changing into a tuxedo, literally standing in my underwear, when my cell phone rings. Our hoster is replacing the UPS that failed earlier in the week, something went wrong, and we lost power to half our rack in Hamburg. Again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I'm beginning to thing that the 'uninterruptible' in 'uninterruptible power supply' is a cruel joke. I've had far more experience with losing power from a failed UPS or from poor handling of a UPS than actual power outages. The best story is from my old company, when the boss was demonstrating a UPS and cut power to all servers attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, the important machines have redundant power supplies and will keep running when one circuit goes down. In practice some things always fail (in this case a RAID that should have stayed up but didn't) and need personal attention to get back up and running, especially since we had had an outage earlier in the week and some services had been moved. In my underwear in Munich, though, I couldn't do much for the cluster in Hamburg. However, while we may have some single points of failure for the cluster, I am not one of them. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://putzi.blogg.de/&quot;&gt;colleague&lt;/a&gt; in Cologne only had to check a couple of small things with me, and had everything back up within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees in Germany are legally entitled to vacation time, so nu2m can't get any ideas about preventing disasters by refusing all my requests for days off. Besides, disasters have also occurred on days I'm not off, so it wouldn't be a sure policy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;MamaMaus prefers that I don't mention her name or employer here, but it's going to be difficult to keep her secret when she gets &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.welt.de/data/2006/11/16/1111994.html&quot;&gt;quoted in the newspaper (Die Welt)&lt;/a&gt;. I hear she was on the TV news as well (NDR Hamburg Journal).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Full House</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/15/full-house</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning Christopher asked if he could invite the neighbor boy Ren√© over to play this afternoon. Christopher had visited him before fall vacation, and they share a common interest in Legos. We're trying to encourage Christopher to keep contact with his local classmates, since he went to Kindergarten in a different town. Sure, I said, Ren√© could come over to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after lunch, just after we arranged things with Ren√©'s mother to have him come at 3:00, Johan called. He wanted to come visit Christopher as well. No problem, I thought. He's not the quiet Lego builder type, but three would be more fun than two, so why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then once they were here, and definitely not engaged in quiet activities, Christopher decided to bring Carolin from next door (without asking her mother, as it turned out... she called an hour later asking if we had seen her daughter). She's absolutely not the quiet type, and did her best to raise her volume to match the three boys. So I suddenly had a house full of loud first graders, with nothing to calm them except for orange juice and gummy bears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a quiet Lego building session, we had a wild afternoon of riding the wild bucking Ikea styrofoam banana and having ghosts fight against knights in the dark. No one cried, no one got hurt, no one was left out. By 6:00 they were all gone, and Christopher said it had been the &quot;best afternoon&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to a stressful week at work where I've been dealing with defective power supplies and UPSs at our hoster, the noise at home was actually rather relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Not My Pod</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/11/not-my-pod/"/>
   <updated>2006-11-11T06:59:39+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/11/not-my-pod</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the hoopla recently (at least in the Mac fanboy world) over the 5th anniversary of the iPod, it occurred to me that I've never really figured  it out. I own a iPod, two actually (a 4G 20GB and a 1G Shuffle), but they are more a source of frustration than of joy. I'm probably too old to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the iPod to be a beautiful and fascinating mistress that demands a lot of attention. For one thing, unlike a normal device you just can't turn it off. You have to hit two switches, the wheel to switch off, and the slide to lock it so it stays off. If you forget to lock it, it will bump against something in your pocket or your bag and turn back on, draining all the power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when it is turned off, the thing sucks power. I've found that if I don't listen to it for about a week, the power will be gone. Like I said, the iPod demands attention, daily attention, otherwise it goes into a sulk. More times than not when I want to listen to it, the battery is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I find the white earpods to be way too pretentious, again fitting of a attention-demanding mistress. I have mine hidden away and use Panasonic basic black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole syncing nonsense doesn't fit into the way I listen to music or use the computer. When I'm home, I listen to music over the air, not through my MacBook or earpods. The mp3 files are on a server in the basement, fed to the speakers with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html&quot;&gt;wireless Squeezebox&lt;/a&gt;. I tried keeping a music folder on my notebook synced with the server, but it was a pain and now there's not enough room on the MacBook for a music folder anyway. When I'm away I want to listen to iPod (at least when it has power), so I basically never use iTunes to listen to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don't use iTunes to listen to music, it has no idea what I listen to and it's suggestions are useless. I've never bothered with playlists. My listening habits come from a time when music came on vinyl and you listened to a side at a time. At any rate, we have three listeners here at home, and I don't know how iTunes would sort my fine taste in music from that of my wife, and to ignore the stories that Christopher listens to. Needless to say, I haven't rated or tagged any files. That's just yet another demand for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find the random shuffle mode to be pretty much useless. When I listen to the Shuffle, I generally click forward to the song I want. It only takes about 50 clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have a new problem. My music collection, or should I say our audio collection, is now 20.5GB. It no longer fits on the iPod. Since iTunes has no idea what I listen to, it has no idea what to sync and leaves all the new music out, which is pretty much the opposite of what I want. Since the iPod already demands too much of my attention in relation to the pleasure it brings, the last thing I want to do is to create a playlist for the iPod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll probably end up buying another one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  I tend to think politicians should be changed often, just like diapers, and for exactly the same reason.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He suggested it applied just as well to Germany, to which I replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Does that mean grand coalitions need to be changed more frequently?

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/11/08/we-dont-need-no-education</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From an article on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/education/08germany.html&quot;&gt;Jacobs University Bremen&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2006/11/private_donatio.html&quot;&gt;German Joys&lt;/a&gt;), which recently changed its name after receiving a $250 million donations from a certain Herr Jacobs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  German universities lack the resources of their American rivals. The United States spends 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product on higher education; the Germans, only 1.1 percent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess because Germany would rather spend money on the past (like coal subsidies) than on the future. The closing quote was also cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Why didn¬ít Mr. Jacobs give his millions to his own alma mater, the University of Hamburg? ¬ìThey didn¬ít ask.¬î

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another pitfall of telecommuting is that they start an internal blog at the office and you don't find out about it until 6 weeks later (no, it's not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technorat.de/&quot;&gt;Technorat&lt;/a&gt;). They've been posting profiles of various co-workers, and since I doubt that &lt;a href=&quot;http://poolie.kulando.de/&quot;&gt;Poolie&lt;/a&gt; will come to Hamburg to interview me, I've decided to save him the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musical taste?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not as progressive as I used to be. My earbuds are black.&lt;/p&gt;

Myself. Usually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is on your desktop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Hold on, I'm still looking at the menu...&lt;/p&gt;

No time for TV. Who killed Laura Palmer anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many pillows do you sleep with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One, but that's probably not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hotel or Camping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hotel, unless we're looking for adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your motto?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Everything depends on your point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is Herr Latz?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the pitfalls of telecommuting is that you have no idea where your co-workers are. I just now, at 11:30 am, realized that today is a holiday in Cologne, which explains why no one is sending me any mail or Jabber messages today. They may have more days off in Cologne, but the higher quality of life in Hamburg more than makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of quality of life, Hamburg just had the highest storm tide in 15 years (5.90 meters, which is actually 20 cm higher than the killer flood of 1962, if you're looking for evidence of global warming). If you parked on the Fischmarkt this morning, the inconvenient truth is that your car is now floating in the Elbe (or perhaps more inconvenient, has been impounded by the police).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: The flood was actually a meter lower than expected, so no record. They still towed away lots of cars, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Expat scenes invariably have plenty of writers and artists but a curiously scant quantity of writing and art. This isn't a new phenomenon: Ernest Hemingway alluded to it in The Sun Also Rises, when Bill Gorton jestingly upbraids Jake Barnes: &quot;You drink yourself to death,&quot; he says. &quot;You become obsessed with sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafes.&quot; George Orwell made a similar observation in &quot;Inside the Whale&quot; (an essay-length riff on Miller's Tropic of Cancer), pointing out that expatriate writers are disproportionately obsessed with &quot;drinking, talking, meditating, and fornicating.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must be hanging out in the wrong caf√©s. What, no whining? (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anglofritz.com/2006/10/refuting_the_suckage.html&quot;&gt;anglofritz&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Bastardization of German Culture</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/30/the-bastardization-of-german-culture/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the undue influence of American programs in German television, Christopher is insisting that we go trick-or-treating tomorrow night. Super RTL has been running Halloween specials of all their cartoons yesterday and today. He wants to dress as a ghost and collect a sack load of candy. And carve a pumpkin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to tell him that Halloween is an American holiday, and that German households will not be stocking loads of treats, particularly in the rural area where we live, but he says &quot;You're American, Papa. You know how it works.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is despite the fact we have 3 lantern marches (local town, old kindergarten, new school class) planned within one week starting on Saturday. Of course, lantern marches only involve open flames and songs vaguely related to astrology, which is nowhere near as exciting as collecting sackloads of candy in while dressed in gruesome costumes. Germans do that stuff for Karnival in late winter... well, at least in Cologne and D√ºsseldorf.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>20 km Detour for a Red Light</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/28/20-km-detour-for-a-red-light/"/>
   <updated>2006-10-28T20:31:18+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/28/20-km-detour-for-a-red-light</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of MamaMaus' endearing characteristics is how she takes out her frustrations on her car. I admit, it's annoying at times that when we can't locate our destination, she tends to drive faster, thus making it more difficult to find our bearings, and with her Audi Quattro she can accelerate quite quickly when she's mad. As a result we sometimes get involved in some adventures like we did yesterday afternoon, which I can illustrate with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;ll=53.403597,9.944687&amp;amp;spn=0.091287,0.22213&amp;amp;om=0&quot;&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; for those unfamiliar with the Autobahn layout south of Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/281600228/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.flickr.com/88/281600228_d6f234f268.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;351&quot; alt=&quot;detour_through_harburg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had taken Christopher to a swim lesson in Harburg &lt;em&gt;(Pool)&lt;/em&gt; (it's far from home, but the lessons are flexible), and wanted to make a stop &lt;em&gt;(Furniture Store)&lt;/em&gt; to order something on the way home. It was Friday afternoon rush hour, and we knew there was a traffic jam on the A1 heading west to Bremen, so we chose not to take the Autobahn, but rather the side street Bremer Strasse to head to the store (dotted red line). So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We weren't the only ones with this idea, so there was some traffic on the road. There was also some construction in Iddensen, where they are building a traffic circle to turn off to a garbage dump of all things. So we were later than we wanted to be by the time we reached the intersection with the A1 at Dibbersen &lt;em&gt;(Red Light)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic light had a long red phase. It wouldn't turn green. I don't know if it was extraordinarily long, since I didn't time it, and you don't pull up to a red light expecting to measure how long it takes to turn green. It was at least 3 or 4 minutes. I could hear MamaMaus cursing under her breath, and then somewhat louder. But I didn't suspect what would happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly she pulled off to the right and onto the onramp for the A1. If she couldn't drive through the red light, she was going to drive around it, I guess. At this point I didn't dare ask her what she was doing, since it would have made her mood worse, and it was too late to stop her anyway. So now we follow the blue line on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess she intended to drive to the next exit and turn around, but like I said it was jammed up. So we turn north on to the A261 back to Hamburg. It's clear in our direction, but southbound is jammed for several km leading to the A1. I'm now thinking she'll turn off at T√∂tensen and take back roads to Dibbersen to avoid the garbage dump and the broken red light. But she shoots on past, and when I ask why she says &quot;I'm not getting back on that road&quot;. I then realized what she had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was going to circle on the Autobahn all the way around.... from Dibbersen to Marmstorf to Maschen and back to Dibbersen. And that's exactly what we did. I didn't dare say a word, and niether did Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, getting off at Dibbersen we turned at the same light that was stuck on red before. The southbound traffic was passing through, and I mentioned something like &quot;oh, the light has changed after all&quot;. I didn't get a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, by this time all of our moods were fairly sour, and the poor service at the furniture store made them even worse. That pretty much took care of our evening.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Demonstrating Sensitivity</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;German Joys has been running a short series on &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2006/10/getting_hired_o.html&quot;&gt;Getting Hired or Fired in Germany&lt;/a&gt;. This entry explains the differences between an American &quot;letter of reference&quot; and a German &lt;em&gt;&quot;Zeugnis&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;Zeugnis&lt;/em&gt; is required by law to be positive (at least on the surface), but there are a number code phrases that can be used to express negative opinions. I knew about many of these, but until now I was not aware of the danger of &quot;demonstrating sensitivity to the needs&quot; of my co-workers, and certainly not of the greater danger of showing &lt;em&gt;comprehensive&lt;/em&gt; sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Buried Treasure</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/24/buried-treasure/"/>
   <updated>2006-10-24T07:00:26+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/24/buried-treasure</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday there were two separate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/24/world/europe/24germany.html?ex=1319342400&amp;amp;en=c31b62ea0b218994&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss&quot;&gt;instances in Germany of old munitions&lt;/a&gt; being struck by machinery and detonating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A construction worker was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,444119,00.html&quot;&gt;killed in an explosion on the A3&lt;/a&gt; near Aschaffenburg (between Frankfurt and W√ºrzburg). He was scraping concrete about 30 cm deep when he apparently stuck a buried bomb from WWII. Pieces of machinery were thrown up to 500 meters from the site; a number of cars and houses were damaged, but noone was injured.  The autobahn was closed for several hours. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;amp;article=40976&quot;&gt;Stars and Stripes also has report&lt;/a&gt;, as US bases are also in the area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A farmer in Grabow near Dannenberg &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.ndr.de/ndr_pages_std/0,2570,OID3249642,00.html&quot;&gt;struck a phosphorus bomb&lt;/a&gt; with his plow, dislodging the detonator and releasing a cloud of phosphorus. He immediately called authorities, and they could only watch as the device exploded a short time later. Noone was hurt. It is thought that there are still a number of bombs buried in the area, as an Allied bomber released a full load of bombs before making a emergency landing in Grabow near the end of WWII.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds, if not thousands, of old bombs are still found every year. Last week over 20000 residents in Hannover were evacuated from their homes to defuse 3 bombs. The NY Times article quotes the owner of a munitions clears firm: &quot;We¬íll have enough work to keep us busy for the next 100 to 120 years&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/01/15/bombs-along-the-highway/&quot;&gt;said it before&lt;/a&gt;, but I'll say it again. If a rich, developed country is still clearing munitions 60 years after being devestated by war, how long will it take poor countries to recover from war, especially since modern explosives are smaller and harder to find?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legoland-village.dk/default.asp?pageref=GB.Front&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/legoland_village.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Legoland Village&quot; title=&quot;Legoland Village&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Christopher and I returned from our long weekend at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legoland.dk/&quot;&gt;Legoland Denmark&lt;/a&gt; last night. I hear the &lt;a href=&quot;http://justcallmemausi.blogspot.com/2006/10/playing-with-fire.html&quot;&gt;weather here in Lower Saxony was good&lt;/a&gt;, but up in Denmark it rained cats and dogs. Over the 3 days we had exactly 90 minutes of sun. Good thing we decided against the campground and went for the hostel at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.legoland-village.dk/default.asp?pageref=GB.Front&quot;&gt;Legoland Village&lt;/a&gt;, so we were dry and comfortable (and to Christopher's delight, they had PlayStations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must have been school vacation in Denmark as the park was full of Danes. They were well prepared for the weather, since all the kids seemed to be wearing slickers and rubber boots. However, it was noticeable in a few places that the end of the season was drawing near. The Lego Shop had only close-out specials (and no Star Wars kits at all, much to Christopher's disappointment), and the Mindstorms Workshop was closed for renovation. Otherwise we had a great time. We'll be back next year... the Lego traffic school starts at age 7, and Christopher wants his driver's license!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama had constant rain for her conference in Lisbon as well. We all returned home late Sunday evening, and lo and behold, today it has rained the whole day here. We're unsure whether it's Portuguese rain that followed her home, or Danish rain that followed us. In either case, it's wet.&lt;/p&gt;

The fine folks at the Maricopa County Elections Department in Arizona are very good in that regard, I don't even have to request it. The races aren't all that exciting, Jon Kyl will be easily re-elected to the Senate and the Democrats don't even have a candidate to face Jeff Flake in my House district, but it's the thought that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>McCafe Elmshorn Reloaded</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/17/mccafe-elmshorn-reloaded/"/>
   <updated>2006-10-17T16:31:46+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/17/mccafe-elmshorn-reloaded</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(I'm recycling &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/09/17/mccafe-elmshorn/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from September 2005 for the sake of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creamaid.com/&quot;&gt;Creamaid&lt;/a&gt;. It's still interesting since &lt;a href=&quot;http://ichliebees.de/html.php?t=Unternehmen&amp;amp;c=mccafe_concept&quot;&gt;McCafes&lt;/a&gt; are not yet being built in the US, so the idea of a coffee bar inside a McDonald's will be new to a lot of people. It also &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulstamatiou.com/2005/11/19/how-to-quickie-embedded-flickr-slideshows/&quot;&gt;shows off&lt;/a&gt; how to embed a Flickr slideshow  in a blog post. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creamaid.com/mclovers.html&quot;&gt;ten bucks&lt;/a&gt; is ten bucks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are pictures from the McCafe in Elmshorn, northwest of Hamburg. It's a coffee bar inside a regular McDonald's restaurant, and the idea is relatively new in Germany, although it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050724/COLUMNISTS02/507240442/1035&quot; title=&quot;Broad Ripple McCafe making a fast-food exit&quot;&gt;apparently hasn't gone over well in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Here they seem to be redoing the entire restaurant rather than creating a separate coffee area. In Elmshorn you sit on leather seats whether you are eating a Big Mac or drinking a Latte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald's seems to be quite happy with the results. As of October 2006 170 German restaurants feature McCafe, and eventually about half of all restaurants will include one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took some pictures &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/965120/show/&quot;&gt;(link to slideshow)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/13/travel-plans</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I won't be at the Whiney Expat Meetup in November. MamaMaus needs me to accompany her to her firm's annual charity auction, this time in Munich. I'll again need to rent a penguin suit. The next day we've been invited to a 100th birthday party. The proprietors of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naturheilzentrumdrochtersen.de/&quot;&gt;Naturheilzentrum Drochtersen&lt;/a&gt; (there's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/03/google-patriotism/#comment-21025&quot;&gt;free link for you Kirsten&lt;/a&gt; :-)) and their daughter have their birthdays on the same day, and their ages add up to 100. Ten years ago they celebrated their 75th birthday(s), it's amazing how the time flies. (Math puzzle: how old is their daughter this year?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the two-week fall school vacation starts, um, now. MamaMaus has a 4-day engagement in Lisbon this week, so we men are going to sneak away as well... for 3 days in Denmark. We didn't see all of Legoland the first time we were there, so Christopher and I have to check out all the things we missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we're taking a day-long joyride to Hannover. Mama has business there, and since her Audi doesn't have enough horsepower for Christopher, we'll take the high-speed ICE train, even though it takes longer. It's not hanging around bored in train stations waiting for our connection, it's conducting observational studies of consumer traffic patterns for retail space in a metropolitan transit center. Oh joy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our big plan for fall vacation for Christopher though is swimming lessons. He's hoping to earn his &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%BChschwimmer#Deutschland_.28.22Seepferdchen.22.29&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seepferdchen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (little sea horse) patch by swimming 25 meters. Well, we're hoping for that anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Internet Killed the Video Star</title>

   <updated>2006-10-09T21:01:57+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/10/09/internet-killed-the-video-star</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school in the '70s, you could only see good music on TV late night on weekends on shows like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jumptheshark.com/d/donkirshner.htm&quot;&gt;Don Kirschner's Rock Concert&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://timstvshowcase.com/midnight.html&quot;&gt;The Midnight Special&lt;/a&gt;. Some bands started to make little films that went along with their music, and (according to my friends) I said that would someday the all the rage, that watching music would be bigger business than listening to music. My friends said I was crazy, but some years later MTV was born. I never saw a cent from Viacom. (I actually don't rememeber saying that, but my high school friends insisted I was a true visionary. They also said I was a cross between Spock and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman&quot;&gt;Alfred E. Neuman&lt;/a&gt;, so I can never be sure if they were putting me on or not.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course these days noone watches music, MTV doesn't even show music videos anymore, they're all pirated and downloaded to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. I always thought YouTube was a stupid idea, playing other people's videos that nobody pays for. How do they make any money? I guessed I missed the point, since today &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?dist=newsfinder&amp;amp;siteid=mktw&amp;amp;guid=%7BFADE6E8C-1E83-4177-817E-14A0D5E18ABD%7D&quot;&gt;Google is buying YouTube for $1.65 billion&lt;/a&gt;, even though &quot;YouTube right now generates very little, if any, actual revenues, analysts say&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if any of my old friends are reading, I've lost the touch. I have no idea what's cool anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

The weather was cool and pleasant, and the route was mostly on soft trails rather than aspahlt. Her goal was 70 minutes, and she hit it almost exactly (70:30). She got a certificate and an official finish photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German version of Google at google.de has a nice German flag logo to celebrate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Unity_Day&quot;&gt;Day of German Unity holiday&lt;/a&gt; today (as pointed out by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sichelputzer.de/2006/10/03/das-patriotische-google/&quot;&gt;Telagon Sichelputzer&lt;/a&gt;). However, if you have English set as your language, you see only the normal Google Deutschland logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/google_deutschland.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Deutschland&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.de/de&quot;&gt;google.de in German&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.de/en&quot;&gt;google.de in English&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main site google.com doesn't show a special logo in either language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange. Is this a mistake, or does Google Deutschland think celebrating German reunification is only for German speakers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  A Don't Get Pregnant in Europe logo - It's just a pain having to explain the differences on both sides of the ocean. Even if it costs 5 euros compared to the 5000 euros it would cost back home, don't do it.

   <title>OpenBC to become Xing</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/25/openbc-to-become-xing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's so hard to keep a secret these days, just ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonelygirl15&quot;&gt;lonelygirl15&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openbc.com/&quot;&gt;OpenBC&lt;/a&gt;, the business and social networking site based in Hamburg, will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.openbc.com/2006/09/ooops.html&quot;&gt;changing its name to Xing&lt;/a&gt; later this month. This was confirmed in the OpenBC blog after a couple of webloggers found the name in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chuchichaeschtli.com/artikel/heisst-openbc-bald-xing&quot;&gt;domain and trademark searches&lt;/a&gt;. The goal was to have a domain more meaningful in Asia and English-speaking markets. OpenBC wasn't real clear, it sounds like a group of Old Testament historians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xing might be a good fit in Chinese (it means &quot;I can do it&quot;, so I hear), but I don't think it works as well in English as they think. They are thinking of &quot;crossing&quot; as on traffic signs (Ped Xing, RR Xing). I don't think the abbreviation is used outside of the US. And used by itself, the association with crossing is unclear, particularly if you pronounce it as &quot;Zing&quot;. Even if one does think of a &quot;crossing&quot;, I don't think the panic of one about to be blindsided by a train is the emotion they are trying to evoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it could have been worse. They could have chosen &quot;Xingr&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note to self: should I ever be looking for a full-time local employer in the future, OpenBC, er, Xing sounds like a cool place to work.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/21/stutter-group</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After having had the summer off, Christopher had his first speech therapy session today. A clinic in Hamburg has started a stutter group for children aged 6 to 8 with 2 therapists and 9 children that will meet for 90 minutes every Thursday. The therapy has a large social component, simply bringing them together so they can experience first hand that *other kids stutter too*. That will be a new experience for Christopher, even in the special speech kindergarten he was the only stutterer. The experience is important for us parents as well... *other parents have children who stutter*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group seems to have gotten off to a good start. I didn't wait around the whole 90 minutes, but when I came back 15 minutes before the end the room was quite loud. They were having a pillow fight, and after the session Christopher and 4 of the boys were happy to start an extra round. The group is 8 boys and 1 girl... I hope the girl doesn't get scared off. Two or three of the boys are Turkish... that's good, since his school class is rather homogeneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminder to self: I need to make an appointment with the pediatrician to get a prescription/referral for the group sessions, so that health insurance will cover the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/18/baltic-whackjobs</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In elections yesterday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the poorest German state, the far-right National Democratic Party &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5349696.stm&quot;&gt;earned 7.3% of the vote&lt;/a&gt;, enough to enter parliament. As always when the far-right does well in an election, there is much wailing and gnashing of teeth in the German media. Doug Merrill at A Fistful of Euros is &lt;a href=&quot;http://fistfulofeuros.net/archives/002683.php&quot; title=&quot;Sandy Brown Baltic Shores&quot;&gt;not quite so hysterical&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  On the whole, though, I¬íd be cautiously optimistic... in a state with 18 percent unemployment, the extremist vote was below 10 percent. ... the far right has ebbed and flowed throughout the postwar period, and it¬ís never gotten anywhere close to a share of power at the national level... (finally) the far right tends to fractiousness, as the disintegration of the NPD parliamentary party in Saxony in late 2005 most recently showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  One in 14 voters in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is willing to cast a ballot for right-wing whackjobs. That, for better or for worse, is probably not too far from the European norm.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neo-Nazis aren't interested in politics, they just like the sound of their own voice. I'd be more worried about the low turnout (59.2%), which means a good share of the voters aren't interested in politics either.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/16/gammelgemuse</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For 3 weeks now we've been hearing about the tons &lt;em&gt;Gammelfleisch&lt;/em&gt;, or putrid meat, being found in the meat lockers of Germany, and how long the authorities knew about it before it was made public. The best comment I saw on it was at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eamonn.com/2006/09/somethings_rotten_in_the_state.htm&quot;&gt;Rainy Day&lt;/a&gt;, which cited The Jungle, the classic American expos√© of conditions in the Chicago stockyards in 1906. Noone has died or even gotten sick from bad meat in the current German scandal, although that's hard to tell from the sensationalist press coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in the States, fresh bagged spinach tainted with &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/09/16/tainted.spinach.ap/index.html&quot;&gt;killed one and sent nearly 100 to the hospital&lt;/a&gt; in several states over the past few weeks, including several brands of organic spinach. So, my German friends, don't think you're any better off if you skip meat and eat only vegetables from the &lt;em&gt;Bioladen&lt;/em&gt;. You're taking chances no matter what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I first noticed here was the rancid smell in some (but not all) German butcher shops. I used to clean a meat market as an after-school job, so I know what a clean meat market looks and smells like. I still feel more comfortable with meat from the supermarket than from a butcher who may have different ideas of cooling and sanitation than I'm used to.&lt;/p&gt;

It's kind of like pledge week for US public television, except it's mandatory and there's no pledge week. There's a whole bureaucracy set up to collect the fees called the *Geb√ºhreneinzugszentrale der √∂ffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten*, or GEZ for short. They advertise quite a bit with spots that try to be hip, if you can imagine it could ever be hip to pay TV fees, since their main source of new income seems to be students who live away from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that video and audio streams are available on the internet, so the logic goes, then &quot;internet-capable&quot; devices should also be subject to the broadcast fee, namely PCs and UMTS cell phones. Those that already pay GEZ fees would not pay any more, however any household or business with a computer would have to start paying in January. At the TV rate, that would be like an internet tax of over ¬Ä200 per year with absolutely zero benefit. As a compromise, the ARD is proposing to tax PCs at the radio rate. The ZDF might be against that, since the ZDF has no radio broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have nothing against subsidizing broadcasting, even if it seems to be aimed more at senior citizens than the general population. Maybe by the time I'm a senior citizen, they'll broadcast punk concerts instead of *Volksmusik*. But the whole GEZ is an archaic concept. TV and radio are no longer luxury goods, but public goods, and the subsidy should be paid by everyone by taxes, not just viewers and listeners. Then the whole collection apparatus could be done away with, and there would be no need for an internet tax.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Moral Equivalence</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/12/moral-equivalence</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wasn't going to write anymore on 9/11 this year, my entry on Sunday pretty much summed up how I feel 5 years later. But 2 posts from German blogs that usually don't discuss politics really got under my skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sichelputzer.de/2006/09/11/true-911-memorial/&quot;&gt;Telagon Sichelputzer, True 9/11 Memorial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  With all due respect to the losses to the attack on the World Trade Center back in 2001, let¬ís remember all of the victims of this attack on the USA. And let us not forget all the murder, death and rape committed by many US troops for seeking vengeance in their war efforts while traveling from one country to another. Let¬ís not forget the crimes of Afghanistan and Iraq in their search for Bin Laden. Let¬ís not forget Guantanamo and the secret CIA torture chambers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://earthlingsoft.net/ssp/blog/2006/09/september_11th&quot;&gt;Quarter Life Crisis, September 11th&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  And from here, away from the personal tragedy, I find it hard to see the death of thousands of people in North America as something more tragic than the death of similar numbers of people in other parts of the planet...  those who died in New York did get a lot of more press coverage and they had to serve as an excuse for all the disgraces that our governments ¬ñ particularly the U.S. one ¬ñ have brought over us since in the name of ¬ëfighting terrorism¬í, something that sounds simple but which most, if not all, people cannot even define clearly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to make similar comments about the Holocaust and, say, the firebombing of Dresden, I'd be (rightfully) run out of the country on a rail. Or is that just me and my blue passport that makes me so sensitive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 strikeouts for Johan Santana. It'd be nice if the score holds up... but watching the Twins live from my dining room table in Germany. Isn't the Internet grand? Too bad they don't play more afternoon games, the 7 hour time difference makes night games somewhat unpractical... :-)&lt;/p&gt;

  I¬íve dug up some things I wrote from New York City and posted here on September 11th 2001 and in the first days following... These mini-essays are not art. They are not reportage, either (but what is?), and may not even be accurate. We were all a bit dazed¬óalthough not so dulled as now. The shock and sorrow were fresh. The events of September 11th had not yet been branded, nor turned into tools of partisan rancor, nor made into a mini-series, nor used to justify atrocity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the same applies to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/&quot;&gt;what I wrote then&lt;/a&gt;, from far away.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/238178329/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/91/238178329_a28850b306.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;IMG 1752&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it didn't take long for this school stuff to become old hat. Already on Wednesday morning Christopher said he didn't feel like going to school today. Heh heh, son, welcome to the next 12 years of your life. Things don't seem to be going fast enough for him. I asked him today what he learned at school, and he replied &quot;Nothing new&quot;. My mother says that sounds like me in the first grade. He was looking very forward to learning to read, and I think he's disappointed that it will take longer than one or two days. &quot;We don't do any reading, all we do are letters of the alphabet. I know those already.&quot; Patience, young Christopher, patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are of course concerned of how the class reacts to stuttering. We mentioned it briefly at the parents' evening last week, and hopefully we can meet with his teacher in the next week or two to explain Christopher's stutter and the progress he's made. Meanwhile, a clinic recommended by his kindergarten offers a weekly stutter group for children aged 6 to 10 that will start later this month. Their main goal is to give the kids (and their parents) the feeling that they are not alone... there are other kids that stutter as well. That's more important at his age than working on specific speaking and breathing techniques, since his mouth is still growing and changing. The group is in Hamburg, so that will mean some driving every week. We've also got to get a referral from his pediatrician so health insurance will cover the cost, so that's another appointment to be made this coming week. We also hope to arrange for him to get into a special PE (sport) group at school, since movement and exercise is also important for speech development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Christopher may already be bored with school, but we've still got plenty to arrange and organize.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Elternabend</title>

   <updated>2006-09-01T06:11:57+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/09/01/elternabend</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This school stuff is starting to get serious. We had our first *Elternabend* (parent's evening) at the school in Jesteburg last night in preparation for the *Einschulung* (start of first grade) on Saturday. (*Einschulung* is a big deal... more on that later.) This is my first experience with the German school system, and here are a few things that struck me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Classes are referred to by number... Christopher is in the class 1C. As I recall our classes were referred to by name, which can be confusing if Miss Crabtree becomes Mrs. Fletcher in the middle of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The class size is 18, down from the announced 20. We suspect the principal was gaming the system by adding phantom children to the list of first graders to ensure there would be 4 classes instead of 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* We had to prepare folders for 4 subjects: German, Math, Science and Social Science *(Sachunterricht)*, and Religion and Music. Sport is also a subject, but has no folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* The class will stay together and have the same teacher for all four years in the *Grundschule*. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* School materials (folders, scissors, paper, etc.) are organized by the teacher and paid for by the parents. This is in addition to the exact list of materials (pencils, crayons, paints) that we were told to buy. The first contribution was ¬Ä35 per child, with more to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Class for first graders is from 8:30 to 12:00. There's a breakfast break at 10:00 (bring your own). As a special service to working parents, you can apply to have your child be supervised an extra hour, until 1:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Since L√ºllau is 4.5 km away from Jesteburg, Christopher will take the bus to school. There's no bus schedule, you have to just know when the bus comes (luckily, we know it comes at 8:10). All the first graders from L√ºllau are in the same class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Parents were asked to volunteer for crossing guards, library, computer help, crafts, or field trips.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;MamaMaus was on a 3-day business trip to Warsaw (the business was only one day, but extra activities and stupid connections meant she was gone 3 days), but unlike her numerous Munich trips, she brought home a nice present... a bottle of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chopinvodka.com/main.htm&quot;&gt;Chopin Vodka&lt;/a&gt;. The coolest thing about it is the packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you can see the composer looking out a hole in the box. He's actually printed on the &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; of the bottle. And I don't even like vodka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German division of her company was incorporated into a &quot;Central European district&quot; last year, so she's having more to do with Eastern Europe. This was her first trip to Poland, and she came back excited, about both the culture in Warsaw, and how well they do business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Update: Did I mention that she (and I) have had the schedule from hell since going back to work? She was on the road 8 out of 9 days, including the entire weekend, while Christopher was home with school vacation and we were stuck in he house because it rained nearly every day? Maybe we both need the vodka more than we know!)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I doubt if Christopher's first day of first grade on Saturday will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beagooddad.com/39/first-day-of-school-in-hammond-indiana/&quot; title=&quot;Be A Good Dad ¬ª Archives ¬ª First day of school in Hammond, Indiana&quot;&gt;anything like this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Ah, the first day of school.  Catching up with friends you have not seen all summer.  Hoping that none of your teachers assign homework on the first day of school.  Dreaming of the first snow day.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/27/ap/strange/mainD8JOI4E81.shtml&quot;&gt;Getting suspended.&lt;/a&gt;...  Well, I normally tried to avoid the last one, but last week, 128 out of 1200 students at Morton High School were sent home for wearing inappropriate clothes....  ¬ìbaggy pants, low-cut shirts, tank tops, graphic T-shirts¬Öand cell phone use.¬î
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you wear the wrong clothes, you get to skip school. I would have loved to have known that when I was in high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few times we've visited the States, a highlight for Christopher has been a baseball game, a visit to the &quot;big stadium&quot;, as he puts it. We first took him to see Tampa Bay when he was 3, and a year later he still remembered the stadium when we saw it from the freeway. Of course he mostly enjoys the stadium experience, like hot dogs, ice cream in a mini-helmet, and cotton candy that makes your tongue turn blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/225734609/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.flickr.com/67/225734609_2fe86ed7ea_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we saw the Twins play Cleveland the night before we flew home, sitting behind the visitor's bullpen. Christopher's started to pick up some to pick up some details of the game, and he now has a favorite position, namely catcher. Specifically, the bullpen catcher (so it has nothing to do with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/2006/0807.html&quot;&gt;Joe Mauer hype&lt;/a&gt;). He was fascinated by the catcher's gear and how he caught the ball and threw it back to the pitcher, and spent an entire inning pantomiming those motions. Good thing the Cleveland bullpen was busy... &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=260816109&quot;&gt;the Twins won 7-2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I was checking out baseball highlights (I'm a MLB TV subscriber, and it works much better now on the MacBook now that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flip4mac.com/&quot;&gt;flip4mac&lt;/a&gt; supports Intel). Christopher asked if we could watch some catchers in action. Of course, the highlights tend to show hits and not the catcher catching to ball and throwing it back to the pitcher, so we found a live game (Cubs and Cardinals) so he could cheer every pitch that was not a foul ball or a hit. I tried to explain out the game works (one linguistic problem, when I said the batter was out, he asked whether the game had ended, since in German when a game is &quot;out&quot; it's over). We were talking so much that MamaMaus was wondering whether we were watching baseball or playing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/225735108/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.flickr.com/85/225735108_2ee3eb8ad8_m.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; alt=&quot;CIMG0010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning at 3 I woke up and remembered that Johan Santana was pitching against the White Sox, and got up to watch him pitch for a couple of innings. That was a mistake... I ended up watching nearly 2 hours. the Twins blew a 3 run lead, with Nathan giving up 2 run homer in the 9th, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap;_ylt=ArpjM94kxnHb9MiGQulF8OUf0bYF?gid=260826104&amp;amp;prov=ap&quot;&gt;the Twins won in the 11th&lt;/a&gt;. No matter what happens today, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060819&amp;amp;content_id=1618497&amp;amp;vkey=news_min&amp;amp;fext=.jsp&amp;amp;c_id=min&quot;&gt;&quot;pirahnas&quot;&lt;/a&gt; will leave Chicago leading the wild-card race. They're now only 4 games behind Detroit, and since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap;_ylt=ArAMg7WJlP8kb5zwQQ9ZspsZ0bYF?gid=260826105&amp;amp;prov=ap&quot;&gt;Tigers seem to be fading&lt;/a&gt;, anything can happen before the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This afternoon Christopher and I are on our way to the big stadium again, this time to watch HSV play Hertha, our first live Bundesliga match. Christopher thinks soccer is nice, but nowhere near as much fun as baseball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our return with Northwest Airlines was a mixed bag. Internet check-in and seat selection is cool. Flying 25-year-old DC-10s in this day and age is not. We arrived 3 hours before take-off, taking the travel advisories into consideration, but despite the warnings ecurity was so fast we ended up consuming liquids in the airport bar for 2 hours before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll have to take back all the bad things I've said about Northwest Airlines. Our flight from Amsterdam to Minneapolis was our best flight ever to the States. The A330 is comfortable even in coach, and the entertainment system kept Christopher well occupied. And entry through immigration and customs in Minneapolis was also the fastest we've experienced, 10 minutes including waiting for luggage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like last year, we'll be at the lake with my parents. No landline, no cell coverage, no DSL, 1 TV channel. There are neighbors with open WLANs, so maybe we can sneak online once in a while. Or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/08/01/immersion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're getting ready for our trip to the States, and given that it was 103¬∞F (with humidity to match) at the lake on Sunday (where it's supposed to be cooler than in town), we'll be packing very light. Good thing the weather broke on Monday... it should be down to 85¬∞F by the time we're there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering whether this would be a good time to start speaking English with Christopher again. When Christopher was born, we tried splitting languages with him, MamaMaus speaking German, I speaking English, but I must admit I was not very consistent. We've spoken German at home since we came to Germany (at first to help me learn German) that I had a hard time switching back and forth, especially with a child too young to answer back. Then Christopher's speech problems emerged, and we (I) got gun-shy and stopped English altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things we learned was that speech problems in general, and stuttering in particular, have nothing to do with a bilingual home. We (I) still held off with English. There was no good reason for it, but with the stress of therapy and the goal of increasing self-confidence, we didn't want to compound the stress by reintroducing a second language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this trip would be a good catalyst to get started again. He'll get going again once we're there, and when we come back I can tell him I'm tired of speaking German and will speak English at home from now on. He can answer in whatever language he wants (that will be German, for sure). To help me stay consistent, I'll have to start speaking English with MamaMaus as well, but I think she can handle that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone with experience raising bilingual children have any thoughts or suggestions on reintroducing English?&lt;/p&gt;

Their culture was alien to both employees and consumers, and they never grew big enough to compete with established discounters like Aldi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt; There's a nice discussion (in German) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/archives/3922-Wal-Mart-zieht-sich-aus-Deutschland-zurueck.html&quot;&gt;why Wal-Mart failed&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopblogger.de/blog/&quot;&gt;Shopblogger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear a hat. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry an umbrella. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a hand fan. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little bandana things with gel inside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use light moisturizers and sunscreens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loose, light-colored clothing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open footwear. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate from shade to shade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only add that it's as much about attitude as anything else. Germans love to piss and moan, but pissing and moaning won't make you feel any cooler. The attitude that you can do something about it will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a trip up north to Denmark for the weekend, and I was most impressed by our stop Sunday morning at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scandinavian-park.com/index.php?id=10&quot;&gt;Scandinavian Park&lt;/a&gt; in Flensburg, a shopping center for Danes just inside Germany with a business plan based entirely on selling Danish beer at German prices. Prices are prominently displayed in Danish Kroner, and it's open &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scandinavian-park.com/index.php?id=33&quot;&gt;late evenings and Sundays&lt;/a&gt;. Among other shops there's a cheap &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etaphotel.com/etaphotel/fichehotel/gb/etp/6299/fiche_hotel.shtml&quot;&gt;Etap hotel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heingericke-flensburg.de/&quot;&gt;motorcycle supply shop&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hier-bin-ich-koenig.de/&quot;&gt;slot-machine arcade&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beate-uhse.com/&quot;&gt;Beate Uhse&lt;/a&gt; sex shop. One stop shopping at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course if the EU ever equalized alcohol taxes the whole concept would be bankrupt in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

So we got one. At 10 kg, it's not light reading, but it's everything a Calvin and Hobbes fan could hope for (short of a rivival of the daily comic strip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin and Hobbes has (for now) replaced Harry Potter as Christopher's bedtime reading (with on-the-fly translation by Papa). Since he's Calvin's age, I think he sees the stories not so much as humor than as absolute truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to beat the heat is to get up early and get your outdoor tasks done before it gets too hot. You'll want to be careful if you're barefoot, though. You never know what you might step on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogg.de/&quot;&gt;blogg.de&lt;/a&gt; we used to run a ping service using XML-RPC (similar to weblogs.com) for German (language or related) weblogs. We &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogworkorange.de/eintrag.php?id=87&quot;&gt;discontinued the service&lt;/a&gt; back in November. The data coming in was at least 99.9% garbage, either spam or from logs having nothing to do with German weblogs. The start page for blogg.de now lists entries only from blogg.de weblogs instead of the entire German blogosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, 8 months later, we still receive over 60000 pings per hour, every hour. I recently set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modsecurity.org/&quot;&gt;mod&amp;#95;security&lt;/a&gt; to filter out the ping requests (with HTTP status &quot;410 Gone&quot;) while letting through the (very, very) few legitimate requests from registered blogg.de users. The load on our web servers decreased by 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of pings coming in hasn't decreased at all. After 10 days we're still at over 60000 per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Christopher was born, his uncle gave him a framed print of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes&quot;&gt;Calvin and Hobbes&lt;/a&gt; for his bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Christopher discovered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0836218256&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; to go along with with his print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think he's just found a very poor role model. I suspect that was his uncle's plan all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised, here's Christopher doing laps around the backyard. There's only one firey crash, at 0:22. We're still working on braking and coming to a safe stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the bike is too small for him. It's two years old, and he's, well, grown in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bravery and Balance</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/07/16/bravery-and-balance</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've got poor priorities for shooting video. Instead of taking silly videos of my wife, I should have been filming Christopher this afternoon as he was doing laps around the backyard on his bike, the first time without training wheels. He was pretty happy with himself. That he wasn't until now able to keep up with the neighbor kids in the bike-riding department was a sore point with him. We tried a couple of times last year, but he kept asking for the training wheels to go back on. Today he crashed a few times in the grass, but laughed at himself and kept going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sign of his improved coordination and self-confidence came a few weeks ago, when he insisted we take him swimming so he could show us what he could do in the deep water.  He's never wanted to even get his head wet before, but now he's going in water over his head with inflatable water wings on his arms (is that really what &lt;em&gt;Schwimmfl√ºgel&lt;/em&gt; are called in English?) and doing cannonballs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really have to thank his kindergarten for this. They go swimming in groups of 3 every few weeks, and I also know they've been having Christopher practice with a walking bike outside. He's also been doing an hour of therapeutic tumbling every week, paid for by health insurance. Now after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/05/1st-day-kindergarten/&quot;&gt;two years&lt;/a&gt;, he just four days left. Then, after summer vacation, he starts public school. I'm sure bravery and balance will come in handy there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll do some more bike laps tomorrow afternoon, I'll try to remember to bring the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the month I reduced my hours at nu2m to half-time, in preparation for the beginning of Christopher's school career in September (when he'll come home at noon on weekdays instead of 3 pm). I thought that by reducing hours before I needed to that I'd have a few weeks of relative peace and quiet. It hasn't turned out that way. All the personal and family things that need to be done have expanded to fill my free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason has been MamaMaus' injured foot. Her role in the household has been reduced to those items that don't involve walking, driving, picking things up, or climbing stairs.  That doesn't leave a whole lot. The good news is that's she's off her crutches as of today, since the orthopedist asked her &quot;What, you're not walking on it yet?&quot; at her appointment this morning. She took that as a challenge. (And, yes, she's been back at work for over a week. She's been hitching rides with colleagues to get to the office.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher's day of Kindergarten is Thursday, when all the school-goers jump (or are thrown) out the window. They have their Summerfest on Friday, then he has vacation until September 2, with a 2-week trip to Minnesota at the beginning of August.&lt;/p&gt;

That's roughly the same number who watch the NCAA men's basketball final or the World Series. That's also &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldcup.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=343&quot;&gt;roughly the same number&lt;/a&gt; of viewers who watched the final in Great Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for all those folks &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldcup.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=274&quot;&gt;complaining about the American announcers&lt;/a&gt;, you don't know how good you have it. I had to watch 90% of the games in 1986 and 1990 in Spanish. I'm sure I heard the name &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona&quot;&gt;&quot;Diego&quot;&lt;/a&gt; uttered at least ten thousand times.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday Christopher and I left MamaMaus with her injured foot at home to check out the last day of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fanfest.hamburg.de/&quot;&gt;World Cup FanFest&lt;/a&gt; in Hamburg. In his Italia shirt he fit right in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First he had to try out the trampoline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying at the Heiligengeistfeld. (Update: I just realized that's my old office building in the background. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netlife.de/&quot;&gt;Netlife&lt;/a&gt; RIP. The color is washed out because the sky was really dark, and I had to lighten up the picture to show Christopher's smile.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started to rain, so we went inside to the foosball tables.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been meaning to post something more on last night's game, but instead I'll point to a couple of tech bloggers who've written about it, namely Matthew Langham who explains how &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.silentpenguin.com/archives/2006/07/germany_loses_a_1.html&quot;&gt;Germany won&lt;/a&gt; even though the team lost, and Tim Bray who says it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/04/Germany-0-Italy-2&quot;&gt;what soccer was meant to be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thought as it ended was the fastest 118 minutes of scoreless soccer I've ever watched, and that it was a game to remember for a couple of decades, since (due to tournament seedings) good teams face one another so seldom in in non-friendlies. The last time Germany and Italy met in a World Cup was the first Cup I closely watched (and rooted for Germany), the final in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- ckey=&quot;5C548C12&quot; --&gt;We have temperatures well over 32¬∞C (90¬∞F), so yesterday afternoon Christopher cooled off in the Seeve, the creek that runs near our house. It used to be a popular starting point for canoes, but the banks have eroded and the county has now banned all boats. They're currently building up the bank, so Christopher had to nearly crawl over a backhoe to get in the water&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a slideshow &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/72157594187886703/show/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for grandparents and other Christopher fans.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After running 5K in the Buchholzer Stadtlauf last year, MamaMaus has been looking forward to running 10K this year. The big race was today, her firm was a main sponsor and she started together with a dozen colleagues. The weather was warm, but a a breeze kept things from getting too hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/179975788/&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.flickr.com/75/179975788_90da32fd62.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;IMG 1535&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, she never finished. About 500m into the run she stepped on a plastic bottle that someone had dropped, her ankle gave way, and fell in agony to the ground. The medics took her away in an ambulance, and her race was over. She has torn ligaments in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/18/injured-reserve/&quot;&gt;same ankle&lt;/a&gt; as in 2003, and will be limping for 4 weeks. Good thing we didn't toss out the crutches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she'll miss the World Cup final in Berlin next weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was open house at Christopher's kindergarten. The theme was Color in Kindergarten, and they had numerous projects and games with colors and painting, including an auction of several paintings done by the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teachers had obviously dropped hints to the kids to get their parents to buy paintings. Christopher has been telling us for a week he wanted us to buy his group's painting. Since it's all for a good cause, we were ready to make our bid. The auction started at 1 Euro, and by the time we got up to 25 Euros the competition had been scared off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anyone for 26? Going once, going twice...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this point Christopher shouted &quot;Twenty-six!&quot;, taking the bid from his own mother much to the delight of the crowd and the auctioneer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there's a law about minors and valid contracts, but we weren't going to be fussy, and we paid the 26 Euros. We now have this wonderful masterpiece in our front hall, &quot;The Puzzle&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

He's already planning on fishing from the dock, playing tricks on his Uncle Steve, roasting marshmallows, and getting presents from the Lego Store at Mall of America. He's also looking forward to swimming in the lake, but he has a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can't be naked in America.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assured him that applies only outside. As long as he goes inside to change into his swimsuit, he's OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white one is mine, the black one is MamaMaus'. Christopher went empty today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the complaining I did, the MacBook arrived on the exact day Apple estimated delivery. It doesn't whine, it doesn't moo, and it's not too hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MamaMaus' employer is rolling out Blackberries throughout Europe. She's been used to replicating Lotus Notes on her notebook. Her first comment: &quot;This is easy. You mean I don't have to sync it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be sitting in the &quot;north curve&quot; just behind the right post of the right-hand goal (if you're watching on TV). Christopher might be holding up his American flag. Wave if you see us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; We're back. Italy won and we had a good look at the second goal on our end. Here are a couple of pictures&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes good things do come to those who wait. Last week MamaMaus was offered comp VIP tickets for the World Cup match Saudi Arabia - Ukraine in Hamburg. We got free food and drink, the weather was comfortable (after a thunderstorm cooled things off just before kick-off), there were a lot of goals, and we had a good time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seats were good too, just behind the Ukraine bench. We were in the same row as Uwe Seeler, and we could see FIFA President Blatter a few rows below. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Football with champagne and hors d'oeuvres. And Budweiser. There were several levels of VIP as far as I could tell. We were at 2nd or 3rd level.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Heroes and Villains</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/06/16/heroes-and-villains</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The thing that's so cool about the World Cup, and soccer in general, is that it's so blatantly emotional and subjective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the past couple of days. There have been 3 games (Germany - Poland, England - Trinidad and Tobago, Sweden - Paraguay) where the plot line has been basically the same. The favorite struggles to score against a defensive underdog and can only win by scoring very late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/matchreport/0,,1797918,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Guardian Unlimited Football | World Cup 2006 | Heartbreak for Poles as Neuville grabs last-gasp winner&quot;&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; were persistent and courageous, and the result was a just reward for tenaciousness and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2057125,00.html&quot; title=&quot;England Struggle to 2-0 Win Against Trinidad and Tobago | Match Reports | Deutsche Welle | 15.06.2006&quot;&gt;villains&lt;/a&gt; were confused and inept, and the result was simply a great stroke of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/iht/2006/06/16/sports/IHT-16websweden.html&quot; title=&quot;Sweden 1, Paraguay 0: Big-Name Attack Struggles but Survives on Late Strike - New York Times&quot;&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; was so boring that I switched it off.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>USA - Czech Republic</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/06/12/usa-czech-republic/"/>
   <updated>2006-06-12T17:26:35+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/06/12/usa-czech-republic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, the real World Cup started at 6 pm today, but the USA is being outclassed by the Czech Republic. The US can control the ball, but it looks like they've made the mistake of bringing stiletto knives to an axe fight. They're trailing 2:0 at halftime. At least they've mastered the offside trap, which the Germans still need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germans have this thing about complicated football (er, soccer) pools, so you can see how badly I've predicted at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kicktipp.de/blogtipp/tippuebersicht&quot;&gt;Blogtipp&lt;/a&gt;. I did pick the Czech Republic to win the Cup, based on two simulations I read about. One was a video game, the other a beer competition in Stern. Good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best Internet live commentary, by the way, is at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; and not just because they &lt;a href=&quot;http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/minbymin/0,,1788207,00.html&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; my emails (scroll down to 83 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: 3:0. This has been a Cup without blowouts, until now. The US was energetic, but unimaginative. How did the US ever earn the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fifa.com/en/mens/statistics/index/0,2548,All-May-2006,00.html&quot;&gt;5th place FIFA ranking&lt;/a&gt;? In March against Germany, and again today, we've been outclassed. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;MamaMaus reports from Munich. She's at a 2 star hotel with 5 star World Cup rates this week for business meetings before the World Cup opener on Friday. The hotel was apparently was last redecorated for the previous big sports event in Munich, the 1972 Olympics. Her meeting for Thursday was cancelled, she booked a flight home so she can sleep in her own bed one night before returning for the opening match and the hotel lost in the '70s Friday night. She may have VIP tickets, but her hotel is lost in the twilight zone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Never Talk to Tele2</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/06/06/never-talk-to-tele2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I got a sale call from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tele2.de/&quot; title=&quot;TELE2 Deutschland&quot;&gt;Tele2&lt;/a&gt; offering some sort of pre-select phone package for local and long-distance calls. I politely said I wasn't interested and hung up. I never buy anything on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The telemarketer from Tele2 apparently disagreed, and submitted an order in my name anyway. A letter arrived a week later thanking me for my registration. I immediately faxed a cancelation to Tele2 Customer Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cancelation was ignored. This weekend T-Com informed me that all calls from our line would be routed through Tele2. I called T-Com this morning, and they seemed to be familiar with the scam. When I mentioned I was calling about a pre-select change, the rep replied &quot;You don't want it, right?&quot;. He assured me that the routing change would be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what advice I should give. I would never do business with Tele2, but even if you don't talk them, you might end up doing business with them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just returned from camping. The weather was perfect: mostly sunny, slightly breezy, dry, and warm enough for short sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it was only perfect for one hour as we were packing to leave. Otherwise, the weather was mostly miserable. Rain on Saturday, wind on Sunday, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wetter.com/v2/?SID=&amp;amp;LANG=DE&amp;amp;LOC=7003&amp;amp;LOCFROM=0202&amp;amp;type=WORLD&amp;amp;id=45769&amp;amp;size=&amp;amp;requested_values%5B%5D=temp_c&amp;amp;start_d=03&amp;amp;start_m=06&amp;amp;start_y=2006&amp;amp;end_d=05&amp;amp;end_m=06&amp;amp;end_y=2006&amp;amp;local_utc=local&amp;amp;x=33&amp;amp;y=3&quot;&gt;mostly cold&lt;/a&gt; for June (low was 5&amp;deg;C this morning). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made do the best we could. Here's the crew huddled in one of the tents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we visited the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erlebnisbahn-ratzeburg.de/&quot;&gt;Erlebnisbahnof Schmilau&lt;/a&gt;, an old railway station converted into a living musueum. We didn't feel up to a 2-hour trip with a handcar, but we did rent a &lt;a href=&quot;http://6teambike.com/&quot;&gt;6teambike&lt;/a&gt;, a bicycle built for six, for an hour-long round trip.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MB 13/1.83 CTO WHITE</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/06/02/mb-13183-cto-white</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html&quot;&gt;MB 13/1.83 CTO WHITE&lt;/a&gt; is the secret code for &quot;I've ordered myself a present&quot;, namely a new MacBook, with 0% financing so the Finance Minister won't notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battery on my 500 MHz PowerBook no longer charge, so it was time to do something. I work mostly at the kitchen table, but it's handy to sometimes work elsewhere. With no USB 2.0, Bluetooth, high-speed WiFi, or ethernet (broken), the PowerBook is not so practical anymore. Normally I wouldn't consider a new first-generation product, but the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook/specs.html&quot;&gt;specs&lt;/a&gt;, the timing, and the price are all right. I don't need to burn DVDs, nor do I need a lot of disk space. The CPU will probably run hot, but it can double as a foot warmer in winter. The screen is small, but I can plug in a monitor when I'm in the kitchen. I don't do games, so slow graphics don't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that when school starts I'll be spending many afternoons as Christopher's taxi driver, so it will be good to have something portable to work with when I'm waiting for my next fare.&lt;/p&gt;

We're heading to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ratzeburg.de/&quot;&gt;Ratzeburg&lt;/a&gt; and meeting up with his uncles and cousins for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost&quot;&gt;Pentecost&lt;/a&gt; (or is it &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitsun&quot;&gt;Whitsun&lt;/a&gt;) holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't been camping for a few years, so we've been hectically gathering supplies and wondering what we're missing. I'm sure we'll realize we've forgotten something essential once we are there. That's part of of the fun, and it's not like we're in the wilderness. The shops are open all day Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to complicate matters, MamaMaus comes home late from a business meeting tonight, so Christopher and I are packing everything into the Lupo this afternoon, and Mama will be joining us tomorrow in the A8 (did I mention she's now driving Audi after over a decade of BMW?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher is very excited. We're just hoping the weather will turn relatively dry.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Harry Potter and the Development of Christopher</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/05/19/harry-potter-and-the-development-of-christopher/"/>
   <updated>2006-05-19T20:37:19+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/05/19/harry-potter-and-the-development-of-christopher</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago we started reading Harry Potter to Christopher, evenings before he goes to sleep, usually a chapter or somewhat less per night. We've just finished Chamber of Secrets (the 2nd book). He's very excited about it. Sometimes he puts on a tie and a cape and goes around with a magic wand putting spells on things and people. He's also drawn some elaborate scenes from the books in Kindergarten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is Harry Potter appropriate for a six-year-old?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teachers and child care professionals we've told about it have had no misgivings, but most of the parents we've mentioned it to have questioned our judgement. Most of the parents, though, hadn't read the books, but had seen scenes from the movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher has seen ads for the movies on TV, and that's how he knew about Harry Potter in the first place. The movies are inappropriate for his age, of course, but we let him watch the DVDs only with our supervision and only for the scenes we have already read in the books. He's adept with the remote control, and accepts our restriction. &quot;Do you know where we stopped reading? Do I have to rewind now?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also trust that he's beyond the age for confusing fantasy and reality. &quot;I'm just playing&quot;, he says when he puts &quot;spells&quot; on us. &quot;There's no such thing as magic anymore.&quot;  He's been playing with Lego Bionicles for nearly a year, they also have a storyline of good versus evil. Good always wins, but evil never dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher comprehends an amazing amount from the books. We have to the chance when reading to make sure he understands. He always has questions, but almost always about what is about to happen next. &quot;We just have to keep reading.&quot; He doesn't understand everything, but the bit about Voldemort living without physical body is a tough concept for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that Harry Potter is an ideal hero for a young stutterer about to start school. Harry is different from everyone else, he's misunderstood, and he's someone special. He cannot control how others react to him, he can only deal with it the best he can, and do what's best for himself.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>23 mph</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/05/17/23-mph</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orangemedia.de/&quot;&gt;Orangemedia&lt;/a&gt;, our partner firm in Hamburg, recently moved to the Stresemannstrasse. Not only do they have no parking spots, but it is near one of the most famous radar cameras in the city. Of course on my first visit to the new office I got nabbed on the way home, doing 37 km/h in the 30 km/zone. So I get to contribute &amp;euro;15 to the Stresemannstrasse traffic reduction project, aka Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg Bu&amp;szlig;geldstelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure most Americans would find it funny to get a speeding ticket for 23 mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Let me add some background. The Stresemannstrasse is notorious as a narrow high traffic street in a residential area. Unfortunately it's the most direct route from downtown to the A7. In the '90s there were at least two kids killed by speeding trucks running red lights. After that it was made one lane with 30 km/h, but after von Beust took office it was restored to two lanes against the wishes of the residents. &lt;/p&gt;

She'll officially attend at least 3 matches, the opening match in Munich, a final round match in Hannover, and the final in Berlin. These are all business events, so no family members invited. For the match in Munich, her boss thoughtfully scheduled a couple of days of business meetings at the home office that week to make sure his people would be there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did have the opportunity to order tickets (at full price) for us through an internal lottery at the company. This was after the pairings were announced, so we picked the most attractive match in Hamburg, Italy-Czech Republic on June 22 in the final match for Group E. This is the US group, so hopefully they both will have lost to the Americans and will be fighting for second place :-). Alas, MamaMaus has a business trip that day, so Christopher and I will be attending alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher is actually looking forward to it, which is surprising since he had absolutely no interest in coming along &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/09/24/good-tickets/&quot;&gt;to HSV last fall&lt;/a&gt;. But he still thinks baseball is better than soccer, so he's looking more forward to watching baseball in the big stadium with his grandparents later this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't blog to be recognized, get credit for being first of whatever, nor to amuse anyone. I am too much of a bastard for that. This blog is here to satisfy my own needs and no one else's. I tend to give a shit too much so I am trying hard to be selfish in the sense 'I don't give a hoot if other folks in this elevator called Earth suffocates if I fart right here and right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Baseball in Hamburg</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since MamaMaus is on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aida.de/&quot;&gt;cruise ship&lt;/a&gt; somewhere between Venice and Dubrovnik this weekend (believe it or not, it's part of her job), Christopher and I decided to take in a baseball game in Hamburg, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stealers.de/lokhtml/lok-news.php&quot; title=&quot;HSV Stealers - Baseball im Hamburger Sport-Verein e.V.&quot;&gt;HSV Stealers&lt;/a&gt; against the Bonn Capitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've watched baseball before in Germany, namely The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildfarmers.de/&quot;&gt;Dohren Wild Farmers&lt;/a&gt;, a 2nd Bundesliga team, but there we were the only ones in the audience not related to a member of the team. Hamburg is in the first Bundesliga and there is a world of difference.  I actually had to pay for admission (Christopher was free), and there were at least 3 dozen spectators in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only made it through 7 innings of one game of a double-header. That took 2-1/2 hours, and the home team was losing 14-3. Near the end we started taking each other's picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Emery and Paola were married (in November 2002), her visitor's visa was no longer valid. 'Marriage invalidates a student or visitor's visa,' Emery said. 'So, if your application for permanent residency is delayed, you're in the worst kind of limbo.' Paola was advised not to leave the country until her permanent residency came through, or she might not be permitted to return. But the process that was supposed to take months dragged on for three years with no end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early this year, the couple sued the director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees citizenship and immigration services, in federal court, and won. Finally, they have their lives back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal bill was $4,435. The human cost was much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most Americans, unless they have family or friends who live in or travel to Europe or Canada, have never heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder_Surprise&quot;&gt;Kinder Surprise Eggs&lt;/a&gt; but when they are finally introduced to them they inevitably ask 'Why don't they sell them in the US?'. The short answer is because the FDA prohibits the sale of something inedible completely incased in something edible.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Acutally, I've never wondered about that. But click through to Dixie Peach, maybe Ferrero has found a way around the FDA...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, until last year, all the tennis shoes I've bought since moving to Germany have been white. And all were bought while on trips to the US, I guess because unconsciously I couldn't find any shoes here I liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago, just before leaving for Orlando, Mama tossed my last white tennis shoes in the trash. Not because they were white, but because (she claims) they were worn out. So now my tennis shoes are blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for something completely different. I need to find a new secret name for my wife. &quot;Mama&quot; doesn't seem to cut it... it certainly describes Christopher's relationship to her, but not mine. &quot;Voldemort&quot; (she who must not be named) is too sinister. &quot;Maus&quot;, her real nickname, is too cute (and is already &lt;a href=&quot;That Queer Expatriate: Caterpillar Footwear&quot;&gt;taken&lt;/a&gt;). She often uses a variation of &quot;Maus&quot; that refers to her employer, but mentioning her employer here is taboo. &lt;a href=&quot;http://claireseuroamerica.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Claire&lt;/a&gt; calls her spouse &quot;The German&quot;.

   <title>Don't Worry, Spend Money</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/04/24/dont-worry-spend-money/"/>
   <updated>2006-04-24T20:01:17+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/04/24/dont-worry-spend-money</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We just got a funny letter from our county's &lt;em&gt;Katasteramt&lt;/em&gt;, a word that at first glance looks like catheter but actually mean land-registry office. They just noticed that we built a carport that doesn't appear in their official plans, and could we please hire a surveyor to measure it (at our cost, of course), otherwise they would take the trouble to hire one for us (at our cost, of course). They didn't say which course of action would be more expensive. The funny part is that the carport has been up for over 8 years, so I guess they don't check their plans all that often. The other funny part is they sent us a photocopy of the survey of our street with all their notes, so we now know none of our neighbors bothered to hire a surveyor for their new buildings either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will hopefully be the last unexpected cost of building our house (finished in December 1995).  That's the bad news when building here, there are tons of unexpected costs that noone tells you about or you don't think about beforehand, up to 20% of the total price if you start adding it all up. The good news is that after the first couple of shocks, you stop thinking about it and don't care anymore. While we were building we no longer talked about money, we talked about units, back then each unit was 1000 DM. Everytime something came up for which we hadn't budgeted, we just laughed,  counted how many units it would cost and added the bill to the pile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't have any cash left because, as we learned immediately after signing the mortgage, the bank takes your money first. When you agree to put up 20% of the cost of building, financing 80%, the bank expects you to spend your 20% before they pay out a single penny. And the first bill comes right away when you sign the contract, namely the real estate transfer tax (&lt;em&gt;Grunderwerbsteuer&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry, spend money, be happy. Your budget will recover about a year after you move in.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Freetime 2.0</title>

   <updated>2006-04-23T19:19:17+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/04/23/freetime-20</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher is all set for a week of freetime, like he did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/04/06/practice-for-freetime/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott &amp;raquo; Blog Archive &amp;raquo; Practice for Freetime&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; with his Kindergarten group, ages 4 to 6. They'll again be at St. Peter Ording on the North Sea for 4 nights away from their parents. Since he's done this before, he's not apprehensive about it at all, and is almost looking forward to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trip like this is not a normal part of German kindergarten, but Christopher does not attend a normal kindergarten. Lisa at An American in Aachen has posted about her son's poor experience with German special education in &lt;a href=&quot;http://an-american-in-aachen.blogspot.com/2006/04/kids-who-fall-through-canyon-sized.html&quot; title=&quot;An American in Aachen: Kids who fall through the (canyon-sized) cracks...&quot;&gt;&quot;Kids who fall through the (canyon-sized) cracks...&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Our experience has been extremely positive, although there are some major differences in our situation. For one thing we are dealing with a charity-run kindergarten and not a public school. It's run by the local chapter of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lebenshilfe.de/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lebenshilfe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a very fine organization that primarily helps the &quot;intellectually disabled&quot; and their families. For another, we live in a fairly well-off suburban/rural county with more resources to devote to education than a typical city. And finally, Christopher was offered specific therapy for his speech problems, and in fact the state of Lower Saxony has made a priority of pre-school speech. Lisa's son suffers from dyslexia, and it sounds like Aachen has nothing specific to offer him other than the &lt;em&gt;Sonderschule&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now our adventure with the German school system is about to begin. As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/04/01/school-20/&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, our local &lt;em&gt;Sonderschule&lt;/em&gt; has determined that Christopher belongs in a regular school. Everything we have heard about our local elementary school has been very good, and our initial contacts have been positive, and they seem to be willing to work with us and with Christopher. We'll find out soon enough. Einschuling, the celebration of the first day of school, is on 2 September.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How She Does It</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.misbehaving.net/2006/04/sophie_vanderbr.html&quot; title=&quot;misbehaving.net: Sophie Vanderbroek&quot;&gt;working mother story&lt;/a&gt;, this time on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/104/vandebroek.html&quot; title=&quot;How She Does It&quot;&gt;Sophie Vandebroek&lt;/a&gt;, CTO of Xerox, whose husband died 10 years ago leaving her with three children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does she do it? By sticking to strict rules for travel, refusing relocations, and living simply. She hires someone to do laundry and grocery shopping, and doesn't sweat it if things don't go perfectly. &quot;So many things we worry about,&quot; she says, &quot;are not important.&quot; She keeps the family schedule uncluttered--only one sport or activity per kid per season--and chooses simple weekend activities and vacations, as well. She even keeps her hair short to make the morning routine quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, she instructs her assistant not to plan any meetings before 9 am or after 5:30 pm. When traveling, she avoids scheduling meetings before 10 am, so she can fly in and out the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she always has accepted new jobs, no matter what crisis was unfolding at home. &quot;The more senior jobs you get, the easier it is,&quot; she says. &quot;You get less control over how busy you are, but you get more over decisions about when you're busy and how you're going to do things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the secret, just keep getting promoted until you control your own schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At New York's Kennedy airport today, an individual later discovered to be a public school teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a slide rule, and a calculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a morning press conference, US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said he believes the man is a member of the notorious al-gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math's instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Al-gebra is a fearsome cult,&amp;rdquo; Gonzales said. &amp;ldquo;They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as 'unknowns', but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'there are 3 sides to every triangle'.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought that noone was reading your weblog, it turns that no, you're wrong. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wonkette.com/politics/intelligence/intelligence-agencies-to-pore-over-pictures-of-your-cat-168336.php&quot; title=&quot;Intelligence Agencies To Pore Over Pictures of Your Cat - Wonkette&quot;&gt;Wonkette&lt;/a&gt;, we now know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20060418-110124-3694r.htm&quot; title=&quot;CIA mines 'rich' content from blogs&amp;#160;-&amp;#160;Nation/Politics&amp;#160;-&amp;#160;The Washington Times, America's Newspaper&quot;&gt;someone is&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Bush and U.S. policy-makers are receiving more intelligence from open sources such as Internet blogs and foreign newspapers than they previously did, senior intelligence officials said. The new Open Source Center (OSC) at CIA headquarters recently stepped up data collection and analysis based on bloggers worldwide and is developing new methods to gauge the reliability of the content, said OSC Director Douglas J. Naquin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    &quot;A lot of blogs now have become very big on the Internet, and we're getting a lot of rich information on blogs that are telling us a lot about social perspectives and everything from what the general feeling is to ... people putting information on there that doesn't exist anywhere else,&quot; Mr. Naquin told The Washington Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Eliot A. Jardines, assistant deputy director of national intelligence for open source, said the amount of unclassified intelligence reaching Mr. Bush and senior policy-makers has increased as a result of the center's creation in November. &quot;We're certainly scoring a number of wins with our ultimate customer,&quot; said Mr. Jardines, who became the first high-level official in charge of the government's nonsecret intelligence in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    &quot;I can't get into detail of what, but I'll just say the amount of open source reporting that goes into the president's daily brief has gone up rather significantly,&quot; Mr. Jardines said. &quot;There has been a real interest at the highest levels of our government, and we've been able to consistently deliver products that are on par with the rest of the intelligence community.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A million monkeys banging on keyboards deliver intelligence &quot;on par with the rest of the intelligence community&quot;? That explains a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Steal Your Own Paper</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/04/18/steal-your-own-paper</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in college I had the perfect part-time job: union scale for no work. I worked the weekend graveyard shift in the radio room of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/&quot;&gt;StarTribune&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, monitoring police and fire radio. My job was to keep a log and to wake a photographer in case something particularly gruesome occurred (like 6 kids dying in a house fire, that made the front page). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the perks was being able to read the final edition of the next morning's paper as it literally rolled off the presses. No more, I guess. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2006/04/17/cant-see-the-forest-for-the-dead-trees/&quot; title=&quot;BuzzMachine &amp;raquo; Blog Archive &amp;raquo; Can&amp;rsquo;t see the forest for the dead trees&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis mentions&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/17/business/media/17carr.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;StarTribune no longer provides free newspapers to its newsroom&lt;/a&gt;, instead setting up vending boxes throughout the office. However, the revenue was somewhat less than expected. The circulation manager sent a memo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first week that the additional on-site racks were in service, 43 percent of the Star Tribunes removed from those racks were not paid for. For the second week the rate was 41 percent. This is called &amp;lsquo;pilferage&amp;rsquo; in our business; but put more plainly, it is theft, pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, the newsroom was the dirtiest and grimiest workplace where I've ever worked, nothing at all like the bright and shiny newsroom they showed on Lou Grant. And I never did figure out why our desk contained sheets and sheets of printed address labels for the law office of former Vice-President Walter Mondale. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Easter Monday</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Easter Monday is one of those holidays we've never gotten into. We usually end up doing some sort of home improvement project like painting or wallpapering. Today we sorted out outdated toys, a big chore since Christopher seems to have inherited my sense of organizations (stack and pile). Our Tagesmutter will be happy for the pile of outsorted toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'd be great to be able to sit in the garden, but the weather is a month behind schedule and we've got standing water on the lawn. No walking on the grass without rubber boots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher was home sick all last week, by Friday we were both tired of being stuck home together. He was healthy enough for the Easter fire Saturday night, but we didn't stay long. Yesterday we searched for Easter eggs in the mud and took Oma out for Easter dinner. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Weekend in Stralsund</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/04/02/weekend-in-stralsund</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We spent the weekend in Stralsund, at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hansedom.de/html/main.jsp&quot; title=&quot;Hansedom: Der Hansedom&quot;&gt;Hansedom&lt;/a&gt;, a spa and wellness park with adjoining hotel. The weekend was a my birthday present from my family, including a fitness test defining in numbers exactly how unfit I am. Christopher enjoyed the water park with 3 slides so much that we went twice. We were very happy with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dorintresorts.com/stralsund&quot; title=&quot;Verw&amp;ouml;hnhotels - Auswahl - DorintResorts Im HanseDom / Stralsund&quot;&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt; (price includes the water park and fitness center), and now that the Autobahn A20 is complete we can reach Stralsund in just 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the evening in the old city and harbor, admiring the view of the half-finished and controversial &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.r&amp;uuml;gen-br&amp;uuml;cke.de/&quot; title=&quot;Die Br&amp;uuml;cke &amp;uuml;ber den Strelasund zwischen der Ferieninsel R&amp;uuml;gen und Stralsund an der Ostsee&quot;&gt;R&amp;uuml;genbr&amp;uuml;cke&lt;/a&gt;, which we were sure my father, the retired highway engineer, would have very much enjoyed. Before heading home today we crossed over to R&amp;uuml;gen and checked out the resort town of Binz just long enough to buy and ice cream, take a quick walk on the beach, and be able to claim that we've been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the weather was even mostly pleasant, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/03/25/where-am-i-who-am-i/#comment-2536&quot;&gt;unlike what we had been warned&lt;/a&gt;. It was a good weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week Christopher &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/03/14/previews-of-coming-attractions/&quot;&gt;attended&lt;/a&gt; a local school for 3 days to evaluate his fitness to start first grade in the fall in light of his stuttering problem. Officially we had applied for the &quot;determinination of special educational need&quot;, but actually we wanted a detailed evaulation with an official rejection. Yesterday we a conference with the evaluator, and that's exactly what we got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academically he'll have no problems at all. He breezed through all the &quot;homework&quot; he was given, and by the second day was already bored. Psychologically we were told that he is self-confident, charming and somewaht extroverted, and that he talks constantly. None of this was news to us. In short, he has all the prerequisites to do well in a regular elementary school in spite of his stutter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll arrange a meeting this spring with his future teacher to explain Christopher's situation, but it looks like everything will be set when school starts on 2 September.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been pretty quiet here the past week. Mama was gone 5 days, including last weekend, Christopher had short days for school testing and a home day on Friday, and I've been up to my ears in work. (I installed a new mail server, but the old server died before the all the users were migrated. And that was just one of several problems.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But things are looking up. Spring is here, the snow is almost gone. Mama has a business-trip-free April. And the three of us are splitting next weekend to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dorintresorts.com/stralsund&quot;&gt;Stralsund&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure that clear thinking will resume shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still favor the traditional system where rich people run the country and convince the morons who live here that the voters are really the ones in charge.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victoria was a hoax UCLA co-ed, created by Cal's Rally Committee. For the previous week, &quot;she&quot; had been chatting with Gabe Pruitt, USC's starting guard, over AOL Instant Messenger. It got serious. Pruitt and several of his teammates made plans to go to Westwood after the game so that they could party with Victoria and her friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, at the game, when Pruitt was introduced in the starting lineup, the chants began: &quot;Victoria, Victoria.&quot; One of the fans held up a sign with her phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The look on Pruitt's face when he turned to the bench after the first Victoria chant was priceless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss went to Cal, I could imagine him participating in something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Previews of Coming Attractions</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher's first day of school may not be until September 2nd, but he'll get his first taste of school this week. As part of the process to determine whether he'll attend regular elementary school or a special ed school, he'll be evaluated for 3 days at the special ed school in Buchholz, this Friday, Monday and Tuesday. He'll be picked up by taxi the three days, and Christopher is as excited about that as he is about going to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already last Sunday (yes, Sunday!) we had a home visit from one of the evaluators. Her initial impression was that Christopher would be just fine at regular school, but that decision will be made by the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me as the stay-at-home parent this will be the first taste of the German school schedule, since Christopher will be home at 11:30 instead of the usual 3:15. There are no meals at school, unlike kindergarten where he gets breakfast and lunch. I wonder if they will give him homework as well.&lt;/p&gt;

The biopsy last week revealed a cancer very similar to that he had 15 (not 10) years ago which responded very well to chemotherapy. In fact, he was much more comfortable after just one treatment. They've done the first set at the University hospital, and the remaining sets he'll be able to do closer to home. I imagine he'll be wearing a cap quite a bit the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With phone calls to the States costing less than one cent per minute, I'm sure our international phone bill this month will skyrocket to at least 3 Euros. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Good-bye, Kirby</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/03/08/good-bye-kirby/"/>
   <updated>2006-03-08T05:37:18+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/03/08/good-bye-kirby</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I didn't mean for PapaScott to become the weblog of death and illness, but sometimes you don't pick your memes, but your memes pick you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I could explain anyone here in Germany how I feel about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/sports/baseball/07puckett.html?ex=1299387600&amp;amp;en=40679e20011901cc&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss&quot; title=&quot;Kirby Puckett, 45, Hall of Fame Outfielder, Dies - New York Times&quot;&gt;Kirby Puckett&lt;/a&gt;, and why I am mourning a retired sports star with a checkered private life who died young. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing you'd have to understand America and sports. Sport (namely soccer) in Germany is at best a 50-50 proposition. If HSV were to win the Bundesliga or even if Germany were to win the World Cup, at best 50% of the population would be happy about it, while the other 50% could care less or would even resent it. In the US sports is more 90-10. When your team wins, your entire community, or city or state, wins, any your sports heroes are heroes for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities in America are pretty much alike. Minneapolis is pretty much like Des Moines is pretty much like Omaha is pretty much like Kansas City. Sport is one way we can differentiate ourselves from one another. People in Kansas City may be pretty much like us, but their team wears a different color. On the other hand, people in New York or Los Angeles are &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; like us, and it feels especially good on the rare occasions when we can beat the Yankees or the Lakers. Our sports teams don't just bring us together, they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks to Kirby Puckett, we were champions, twice. He was the most popular person to ever live in Minnesota, period. He didn't look like an athlete (5&amp;#x2032;8&amp;#x2033; and built like a bowling ball; imagine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schalke04.de/525_asamoah/asamoah.php&quot;&gt;Gerhard Asamoah&lt;/a&gt; with a few more pounds), but he was so talented, and publically so joyful, so likeable, so happy to be where he was, he wasn't just one of us, he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; us. No man could live up to that myth, of course. After he was forced to retire he had a messy divorce, was charged with sexual harassment, became a recluse, and neglected his body to the point where he probably destroyed himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The myth has been gone for years, I didn't know the man at all, but I'm still mourning. I've tried, but I can't really explain it. Maybe others like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aarongleeman.com/2006_03_05_baseballblog_archive.html#114178742700427815&quot; title=&quot;AaronGleeman.com: Remembering Kirby&quot;&gt;Aaron Gleeman&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bat-girl.com/archives/001391.php&quot; title=&quot;Batgirl: Good-bye, Kirby Puckett&quot;&gt;Batgirl&lt;/a&gt; have explained it better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life sucks, and then it sucks some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't enough for my brother, who just turned 40, that he got divorced a couple years ago, lost his job last fall, and has a no-good girlfriend. He went into to the local hospital a Friday night with abdominal pains, which he's had the past 3 weeks but just couldn't stand any longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did a CT scan and determined he probably has a tumor, and he should be checked out by an oncology clinic. It's the weekend, though, so he can't make an appointment until Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday night the pain is so bad he goes in to the ER at 11 PM. And again at 5 AM. The second time they keep him, and as I type this he's on his way to University Hospital in an ambulance with flashing red lights, a 120 mile drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, he's beat cancer (of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.org/&quot;&gt;Lance Armstrong variety&lt;/a&gt;) once already, 10 years ago. Noone deserves to have to go through that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, this should scare off the no-good girlfriend for good. Or she'll turn out to be not so no-good after all, which would be even better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking that maybe I should send him a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cafepress.com/medtees/707993&quot;&gt;Got Morphine?&lt;/a&gt; t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Myth and Reality 2</title>

   <updated>2006-03-02T18:57:47+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/03/02/myth-and-reality-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, did you all do your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/02/28/myth-and-reality/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott &amp;raquo; Blog Archive &amp;raquo; Myth and Reality&quot;&gt;homework&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Newsweek article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11435567/site/newsweek/&quot; title=&quot;Myth and Reality - World Business- Newsweek International Editions - MSNBC.com&quot;&gt; Myth &amp;amp; Reality&lt;/a&gt; is in our experience mostly correct. Germany seems to go out of its way to make it difficult to be parents in a two-career household, and career women. Parents are allowed 3 years of parental leave, with employers bearing most of the costs... with the consequence that employers simply don't hire women unless they can afford for them to leave for 3 years. Second incomes are taxed at such a high rate that after taxes, transportation and child care, there is no financial incentive left to seek work. And Germany's half-day school system ensures that second earners can work at best part-time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/02/28/myth-and-reality/#comment-2421&quot;&gt;Duncan points out&lt;/a&gt; that my own family has profited from Germany's generous family benefits. Not exactly, we profited in spite of the &quot;benefits&quot;. My wife works for an American company, where it is encouraged to place women in positions of authority, even women with children. She also planned her leave carefully, taking only 1 year, and staying in close contact with her office. She's always been the main earner, and it would have been a disaster for us had her career stagnated. Luckily we were able to buck the system. Most of the college-educated mothers we know here have not, and are frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping women out of responsible positions for ancient notions of &quot;family values&quot; is a luxury. Over half of university graduates are women. How long can Germany afford to encourage them to stay home instead of work?&lt;/p&gt;

(It is) estimated that Heros had a market share of about 50 percent.&quot; So, if you run any type of retail establishment in Germany, as of today you have no way to get your money to the bank. That's why Mama is working late tonight (although I'm not sure what she can do, buy a fleet of armored cars on EBay?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Here's a good one: deposits that were picked up by Heros over the weekend are being held pending the bankruptcy settlement. So that money you thought was in the bank on Monday actually isn't. Even if your money wasn't embezzled, you still lose.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mabber Me</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/02/03/mabber-me/"/>
   <updated>2006-02-03T11:11:46+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/02/03/mabber-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mabber.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/mabber.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;mabber&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This week my employer&lt;a href=&quot;#interdings&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; launched the beta of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mabber.com/&quot;&gt;mabber&lt;/a&gt;, a web- and mobile-based instant messaging service. Big deal, you might think. There are already established IM services with web-based clients, and there are already universal web-based clients like &lt;a href=&quot;http://meebo.com/&quot;&gt;meebo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mabber is a big deal. It's do-it-all-in-one-place and do-it-anywhere instant messaging. Most &lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/006817.html&quot;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; have concentrated on the web-client, but that's not where the magic is going to be. (Quite frankly, I find the web-client very distracting, and when working I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adiumx.com/&quot;&gt;traditional client&lt;/a&gt; to connect to mabber. That works, too.) The big deal is going to be the mobile client. Mabber is going to be quicker, easier, and more interactive than SMS. And cheaper, too, even after we start charging for mobile access and even if you are on pay-per-slurp data plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since it runs on the XMPP/Jabber protocol, it can use existing interfaces to ICQ, MSN, AIM and Yahoo!, and of course other Jabber services like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/talk/&quot;&gt;Google Talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I haven't tried the mobile client yet (it won't load on my Blackberry). So I don't know if anything I'm saying about it is true. The key is going to be how easy it is. If it's a pain to install and contacts have to be added manually, it's not going to work. If it is truly easier to use than SMS, we'll have a killer app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of Google mabber is an invitation-only beta, but we're pretty &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@mabber.com&quot;&gt;loose&lt;/a&gt; with invitations. I'm only peripherally involved with the project, since it runs out of our second (count them, two!) data center in D&amp;uuml;sseldorf; my involvement is mainly 'keep everything else running so we can concentrate on mabber'. Of course there's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.mabber.com/&quot;&gt;mabber blog&lt;/a&gt;. And the whole service is run in both German and English, our first project that goes beyond German-speaking countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you can mabber me at shanson@mabber.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;interdings&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;Actually, mabber bears the imprint 'interdings GmbH' rather than nu2m. I'm sure there's some legal / corporate / tax reason for that. I do know that Nico was pleased as punch to land the domain interdings.de.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strike&gt;I wasn't clear enough. If you'd like an invitation, you don't have to beg. Just send a mail to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@mabber.com&quot;&gt;info -at- mabber -dot- com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strike&gt; You no longer need an invitation. As of 12 April &lt;a href=&quot;http://mabber.com&quot;&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; for mabber is open to all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://justcallmemausi.blogspot.com/2006/01/i-wish-i-didnt-have-to-go-out.html#c113811869764813765&quot; title=&quot;I wish I didn't have to go out&quot;&gt;Me:&lt;/a&gt; And I am so looking forward to that this fall! :-(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://justcallmemausi.blogspot.com/2006/01/i-wish-i-didnt-have-to-go-out.html#c113813966897030794&quot; title=&quot;I wish I didn't have to go out&quot;&gt;christina: &lt;/a&gt; Even worse if it's not a verl&amp;auml;ssliche Grundschule- then they can send them home any old time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I've complained before that the concept of substitute teachers is unknown in Germany. If a teacher is sick or doesn't show up for some reason, they send the kids home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense we're lucky, Jesteburg has a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gsjesteburg.de/konzept/aufsatz/en.html&quot;&gt;Volle Halbtagsschule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;full half-day school&quot; (the link is even in English), which means the children aren't just supervised during empty hours, but are guaranteed to have 5 hours of instruction with certified teachers each day. The concept was tested in Lower Saxony in the '90s, but was discontinued and replaced with the cheaper &lt;em&gt;verl&amp;auml;ssliche Grundschule&lt;/em&gt;. Our local school fought to keep their system and won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For first graders the school day is only 4 hours, though, mornings from 8 to 12. I'm not sure if anyone would want to employ a sys admin who has to be home by noon every day. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On weekends, Christopher likes to wake us up. He'll crawl under the covers between us, crouch together for a few seconds, then suddenly spring up, taking the covers with him, and shouting &quot;Surprise!&quot; Typical kid stuff. Last weekend he had a real surprise for us in bed. Out of the blue he said, &quot;When I grow, I won't stutter any more.&quot; It was the first time we heard him use the word stutter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day it got even better. Our &quot;homework&quot; assignment was to explain Christopher's stuttering and progress to a trusted adult. Christopher didn't need to participate in the conversation, but he needed to be present. The idea is to make him comfortable with discussing it openly, not to feel ashamed or embarrassed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were in a restaurant with his old &lt;em&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/em&gt;, and we started explained how his words sometimes hop before they some out and what he has learned to do when that starts to happen. Then Christopher chimed right in and started describing the different techniques he has learned. There is rubber-band speech, tractor speech and race-car speech. There is frog speech (a syllable hops three times) and snake speech, each in slow and fast variations. He demonstrated them all, and make us repeat after him. It's now easy if you've never practiced, and he delighted in pointing out our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our next appointment with the therapist we discovered how he had opened up. The two of them together had taken a large piece of paper and drawn a path of his progress the past 18 months, and his goal for this summer (which is to get thrown out the window on the last day... that's the tradition they have for the children that will be starting school). The path was full of twists and turns and had various triumphs and obstacles along the way. Christopher is very good at visualizing streets and maps, he can point out Australia and Florida on the globe. The point he seemed to pick up is that if you get stuck, it's OK to take a detour. You don't have to go forward all time... sometimes you have to back up and take another route.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Zimbra Collaboration Suite Beta 3</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/01/23/zimbra-collaboration-suite-beta-3/"/>
   <updated>2006-01-23T04:02:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/01/23/zimbra-collaboration-suite-beta-3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been looking for a workgroup system to replace our aging SLOX (SuSE Linux Open Exchange) server. My favorite candidate is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zimbra.com/&quot; title=&quot;Zimbra&amp;trade;&amp;#160;- Home&quot;&gt;Zimbra&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source and commercial system which features an innovative storage and clustering system on the back-end, and a slick AJAX browser interface on the front end. It's still in beta, though, and is only supported on Red Hat systems. And the performance of the betas I've tried has sucked rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new beta came out this month, with news open-source builds for non-Red Hat distributions. I tried a Red Hat build first, for Fedora Core 4. The performance still sucked. Just for fun, I tried out the SuSE 10 build in a VMWare system. To my surprise, the installation was smoother and the performnace was better than under a real (non-VMWare) Fedora Core on the same machine. So now I'm confused...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to further complicate things I see that there is now a live-demo CD of Open Exchange (the successor to SLOX) available, so I'll have to look at that as well. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bathroom Walls</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/01/20/bathroom-walls/"/>
   <updated>2006-01-20T19:09:23+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/01/20/bathroom-walls</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Jean-Remy von Matt is head of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jvm.de/&quot;&gt;Jung von Matt&lt;/a&gt; ad agency which concieved the &quot;Du bist Deutschland&quot; campaign. A lot of German bloggers have expressed the opinion that the campaign is baloney, and so it's no surprise that Herr von Matt &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2458&quot; title=&quot;Klow&amp;auml;nde des Internets [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot;&gt;doesn't like weblogs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weblogs, the bathroom walls of the internet. What gives every PC user the right to excrete* their opinions? Most bloggers simply excrete. This new low point in the building of opinions is clear when one searches for 'Du bist Deutschland' at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com&quot;&gt;www.technorati.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nico Lumma is only too happy to oblige big media types, so just for Herr von Matt he presents the site &lt;a href=&quot;http://klowaende.de/&quot;&gt;klowaende.de&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogg.de/&quot;&gt;blogg.de&lt;/a&gt; with a bathroom wall skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Translator's note: the German original uses the verb 'absondern', which is a new word for me. It means to secrete, excrete or lactate, but also means to separate. It may have a slang meaning which I'm totally missing.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Oh What A Beautiful Morning!</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/01/19/oh-what-a-beautiful-morning/"/>
   <updated>2006-01-19T21:59:58+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/01/19/oh-what-a-beautiful-morning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today got off to a wonderful start. At 4:30 Christopher announced he wasn't feeling good and crawled into our bed (exceeding the capacity of exactly 2 adults). An hour later he said he had to throw up, then did just that (after going into the bathroom, thankfully). So he stayed home from Kindergarten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I flipped open my PowerBook, it couldn't get a WLAN connection. The access point had gone completely dark. Bricked. That certainly puts a cramp in the home office. Luckily I thought of sharing the WLAN connection on the Mac Mini. That works just fine, so we don't need a new access point immediately. Just soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the pump on the washing machine (manufactured in 1990) is refusing to work at an increasing frequency. Unfortunately the Mac Mini can't substitute for that, even Firewire can't keep up with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all this before 7 am! A full day before it was even light out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Wikipedia Outlawed</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The newest trend in Germany seems to be to ban parts of the internet. After &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.werbeblogger.de/index.php/2006/01/04/the_case_heidi_and_guenther_k&quot;&gt;Heidi Klum's father&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogherald.com/2006/01/03/blogger-threatened-to-be-sued-by-sozialgericht-bremen-for-appearing-in-google/&quot; title=&quot;more blog news more often&quot;&gt;Sozialgericht Bremen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.margaret-marks.com/Transblawg/archives/001769.html&quot; title=&quot;German Wikipedia blocked by court order/Amtsrichter sperrt Wikipedia&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin is trying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/politik/0,1518,396056,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Amtsgericht schlie&amp;szlig;t wikipedia.de - Netzwelt - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten&quot;&gt;ban Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, since Wikipedia is hosted in the US, the German courts don't have any jurisdiction. They did manage to put a temporary restraining order on German domain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.de/&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia&quot;&gt;www.wikipedia.de&lt;/a&gt; to prevent it from redirecting to &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptseite&quot; title=&quot;Hauptseite - Wikipedia&quot;&gt;de.wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silly fools. Don't they realize that if Wikipedia is outlawed, only outlaws will have Wikipedia?&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2006/01/16/kindergarten-cop</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back before the fall election I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/06/02/experience-not-required/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott &amp;raquo; Blog Archive &amp;raquo; Experience Not Required&quot;&gt;wondered&lt;/a&gt; whether Angela Merkel had the right stuff and experience to lead a national government, since she had never acutally led a government of any type, only a party. Turns out that instead of a government she got a grand coalition, and her experience herding the Kindergarten boys Stoiber, Koch and Wulff was perhaps the perfect training not only for shepherding junior coalition partners, but for foreign policy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First she &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4537674.stm&quot; title=&quot;BBC NEWS | World | Europe | Angela Merkel's 'EU triumph'&quot;&gt;soothed&lt;/a&gt; the Polish beast with a few billion euros to save the EU budget summit. Then she &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1855733,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Bush and Merkel Hail New Chapter in US-German Relations | Germany | Deutsche Welle | 13.01.2006&quot;&gt;manages&lt;/a&gt; to satisfy domestic opinion and get on George W's good side during her first visit to Washington (the trick: announce in advance that we don't like Guantanamo, but say it very softly, and don't press the point). And today she &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1858256,00.html&quot;&gt;tells Putin&lt;/a&gt; that even though she speaks Russian, she's not his buddy like Schr&amp;ouml;der was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was interesting that George W. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060113-1.html&quot;&gt;remarked&lt;/a&gt; that it was &quot;uplifting to talk to somebody who knows the difference between just talking about tyranny and living in freedom and actually done it&quot;. I know serving as a minister in the Kohl cabinet was tough, but I wouldn't go quite that far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Hermann, our new family member for the next 10 days. Christopher brought him home from Kindergarten, and he seems to be a sourdough of some sort. If we treat him right, he will give birth to 3 Hermann-children, and we can bake a cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, though, he has to be cared for quite carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1. Hermann needs rest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 2-4. Hermann needs exercise. Stir once each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 5. Hermann is hungry! Feed him with 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar and 1 cup milk. He then needs a bigger bowl, otherwise he will run away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 6-9. Hermann needs time to digest. He needs a daily walk. Stir once each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 10. Feed again with 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is then ready to give birth to 3 children (1 cup each, to be given to good friends), and with the rest we can bake a cake (recipe to follow, or just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=86155837&amp;amp;size=l&quot; title=&quot;Photo Sharing&quot;&gt;click&lt;/a&gt; on the photo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher has already memorized the instructions and is making sure we follow them to the letter. Today is Day 1, and despite the rest Hermann seems to have a bad case of gas. We've had to open the cover several times.&lt;/p&gt;

We don't watch much TV, but apparently this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cokefridge.de/&quot;&gt;Coca-Cola's main advertising slogan&lt;/a&gt; in Germany for the tournament. Mama couldn't explain it either, she just shrugged and said &quot;It's supposed to rhyme&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what slogan are they using in the rest of the world, &quot;It's your Ausw&amp;auml;rtsspiel&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

example ceramic bearings), development and processing of specific&lt;br /&gt;
ceramic powders to the pressing and firing of ceramical parts (like&lt;br /&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/23/outage-at-bloggde/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott &amp;raquo; Blog Archive &amp;raquo; Outage at blogg.de&quot;&gt;outage at work&lt;/a&gt; just before Christmas turned out to be a software problem in legacy code on one of our minor sites. It cropped up a couple of more times last week, and ended up costing me 12 hours during a holiday week when I was supposedly on vacation, mostly because I at first misdiagnosed it as a hardware problem. Once I had it isolated, I simply shut the site down and went back on vacation. This week a programmer was able to spot the bug within minutes, and the bad site went back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a learning experience. When the router is not working, it's probably wrong to assume that the router is broken. Legacy code is a time bomb waiting to explode. And the biggest threat to your network is probably behind your firewall, not in front of it. I &quot;knew&quot; all that already, but now having lived it, I now really &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Could You Pass the Test?</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. How many times can a senator be re-elected?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. In what month is the new President inaugurated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. What country did the US fight during the revolutionary war?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out, you might not be a citizen, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elmada.com/000698.html&quot; title=&quot;Failed Citizen&quot;&gt;even if you think you are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/006705.html&quot; title=&quot;Politische Klimakatastrophe&quot;&gt;Could You Pass the German Citizenship Test?&lt;/a&gt; It applies only if you are Muslim, and live in the state of Baden-W&amp;uuml;rttemberg. But then your opinions had better be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/01/04/a0154.nf/text.ges,1&quot;&gt;politically correct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;23. You've heard of the attacks on September 11, 2001 in New York and on March 11, 2004 in Madrid. In your opinion, were the perpetrators terrorists or freedom fighters? Explain your answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;24. The newspapers sometimes report about cases of daughters or wives being killed by family members to &quot;protect the family honor&quot;. What is your opinion of such actions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;29. Imagine that your adult son tells your that he is homosexual and that he would like to live together with another man. How would you react?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I prefer the US test. At least it applies to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

He sure had it good. Static IP address? Direct Internet connection? My first memories of running an Internet server was a mail server running UUCP over a 36K analog modem. My firm at the time was just over 50 km away from Hamburg, our access point, so we were paying expensive Deutsche Telekom long distance rates to get our mail and update our website. Good thing spam hadn't been invented yet. That was at least a step up from the CompuServe address we had been using until then. Oh yes, those were the days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first web server I had that I could put my hands on was at my next company at the turn of the century and the peak of the bubble. That 400 MHz Pentium was among inventory sold to employees as the company headed to bankruptcy, so I bought it and it's now the firewall and router in my basement.  &lt;/p&gt;

I haven't looked all that closely at it, but all the plugins I use still work and posting with MarsEdit is quite a bit faster. However, my two main pet peeves with Wordpress remain. First, there is no export function (so if you want to move your Wordpress blog to another system, prepare to learn a lot of SQL). Second, if you want to move a site to a new URL (if you want to test a new version, for example) you have to edit the database manually (otherwise the admin pages all redirect to the old URL). &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've been busy this week, with Christmas, Christopher's birthday, and his Grandmother visiting for 2 weeks. We spent New Years Eve at home and managed to hit a number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://german.about.com/library/blsilvester.htm&quot;&gt;German New Year's Customs&lt;/a&gt;, eating raclette (with enough leftovers for a repeat performance tonight), drinking &lt;em&gt;Feuerzangenbowle&lt;/em&gt;, and watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2133551&quot;&gt;&quot;Dinner For One&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (twice). We skipped the &lt;em&gt;Bleigiessen&lt;/em&gt; and the jelly doughnuts. Christopher and I instead napped for a bit before midnight to rest up for the fireworks. Sounds like our evening was pretty much like at &lt;a href=&quot;http://justcallmemausi.blogspot.com/2005/12/einen-guten-rutsch-in-das-neue-jahr.html&quot;&gt;Christina's&lt;/a&gt;, where you can read what the New Year's greeting &quot;Guten Rutsch&quot; really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, tomorrow is the start of a normal work and kindergarten week. Mama even gets to fly to Munich overnight to start the year. Grandma will be here all week, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our house we leave milk and cookies for Santa (or, as he's called in Germany, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dict.leo.org/?search=weihnachtsmann&quot;&gt;Christmas Man&lt;/a&gt;) on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/25/earlier-and-earlier/&quot;&gt;sled&lt;/a&gt;. He comes at dusk on Christmas Eve, while we are attending the children's church service. We leave the back door open for Santa, since our chimney is sealed off. He leaves his present on the sled, and also delivers packages from Grandma and eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all Christmas traditions we just made up. We suspect that this will be the last year Santa makes such a grand performance, since next year Christopher will be a sophisticated 1st grader and may have his doubts about the Christmas Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the photo now online, I see we had heavy winds in our living room, some of the candles are leaning quite badly.&lt;/p&gt;

All interfaces on our router would freeze immediately upon restart, and it took me a while to figure out the cause (it wasn't the router, so I wasted a couple of hours working on that). Everything now seems to be back up. The hard part will be figuring out why it happened and keeping it from happening again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher is excited that he only has to sleep two more times until Christmas Eve. Mama and I both agree that we'd rather have another week.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/19/night-train</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week I had the opportunity to fly to Cologne for our company Christmas party, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2353&quot; title=&quot;Weihnachtsfeier im K&amp;ouml;lner Darkroom [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot;&gt;dinner in a dark restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. The experience reminded me how glad I am that my job involves no travel. Giving up 12 hours for perhaps 90 useful minutes of face time doesn't seem to me to be a good bargain. That my boss Nico rather mournfully explained that he has taken some 80 flights this year didn't change my opinion of business travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this week Mama has really drawn the short straw. She has planned for weeks to spend an entire day with Christopher in kindergarten this week. At work she has visitors tomorrow, and a day-and-a-half of meetings in D&amp;uuml;sseldorf Wednesday and Thursday. She was able to cancel out of Thursday, but has to stay in D&amp;uuml;sseldorf until 9 pm Wednesday. There are no flights to Hamburg that late. In order to keep her promise to Christopher, she's taking the train back to Hamburg that evening, and will get home at 2 am so she can take him to kindergarten in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I do not envy business travelers at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/13/midterms</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last summer Christopher was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/06/13/oral-exams/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott &amp;raquo; Blog Archive &amp;raquo; Oral Exams&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; for the first six months of speech therapy kindergarten this school year. Last week was a further &quot;exam&quot; for the 2nd six months, as mandated by the state. That's understandable, since the therapy is expensive and completely subsidized (with no means test... we pay nothing, regardless of income). In practice it makes absolutely no sense to change kindergartens in mid-year, so we were really hoping for approval. We got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got a written report on Christopher's progress. We already know how he's doing, of course, but it's nice to have something formal to show to school officials, since the registration process for first grade has already begun. Our goal is to have Christopher attend the local grade school rather than a separate speech program. Since he is coming from a special ed program, he'll be tested whether he is fit for first grade. We will be part of the decision process, but the decision is ultimately made by the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now that the written report that Christopher has a &quot;moderate stutter, for which he actively employs breathing techniques and which has not hindered his intellectual or emotional development&quot; and the opinion of the state expert who would &quot;absolutely recommend&quot; that Christopher attend regular school. So that's two points in our favor. The next step is an exam for the county in January.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>VPN Part 2</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/07/vpn-part-2/"/>
   <updated>2005-12-07T21:53:01+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/07/vpn-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papatech.de/articles/2005/12/04/vpn-part-1&quot; title=&quot;VPN Part 1&quot;&gt;as I was saying&lt;/a&gt;, I was looking for a simple and workable VPN solution. &lt;a href=&quot;http://openvpn.net/&quot;&gt;OpenVPN&lt;/a&gt; seems to fill the bill. Here are the points that impressed me the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It runs on any Unix-like system or even Windows. The server is not tied to a particular operating system or Linux distribution. I was able to switch back and forth between FreeBSD and SuSE Linux servers with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The connection can run on a single UDP port. It can been tunneled through a firewall with ease, and several clients can run behind a single firewall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software installation on the client is extremely simple. The configuration is a text file, but one only has to edit a couple of lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentication and encryption is done with standard OpenSSL certificates. If you can set up certificates for a web sever, you can set up certificates for OpenVPN. They even include a simple structure for setting up your own certificate authority (or you can use TinyCA or the native OpenSSL scripts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networking is set up on the server side, and the routing information is pushed to the client. DHCP options like DNS and default domains can also be pushed to the client. Even for a site-to-site VPN, the configuration is all on the server side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://openvpn.net/howto.html&quot;&gt;howto&lt;/a&gt; was extremely helpful for setting up the server, and answered all the questions that I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running an OpenVPN client (using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tunnelblick.net/&quot; title=&quot;Tunnelblick - GUI for OpenVPN on the Mac&quot;&gt;Tunnelblick&lt;/a&gt;, a primitive GUI) for nearly a week now, and I'm already convinced. I don't want to go back to using SSH-tunnels. For OS X, you'll probably want a &lt;a href=&quot;http://njr.sabi.net/2005/08/04/overriding-dns-for-domains-in-os-x-tiger/&quot;&gt;script to adjust your DNS&lt;/a&gt; when connected, and you probably don't want to downgrade privileges to nobody. Linux worked well on the command line. I wasn't as impressed with the Windows client, but I don't use Windows much at all, so maybe I was missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not as simple as PPTP for clients, of course, since PPTP is built into Windows and OS X. But for users with more than basic needs, it's worth switching to OpenVPN. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Funny, when I first tried to publish the VPN post yesterday, I kept getting the strange error 'Precondition Failed'. PapaTech is hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;http://textdrive.com/&quot;&gt;TextDrive&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out they do some very aggresive filtering with mod_security, including the names of certain Unix commands like 'ssh', 'wget', and 'echo' which can be used in HTTP requests to run commands on unsecure servers. The side-effect is it's not possible to mention 'ssh' (without quotes)  on a site hosted at TextDrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, at TextDrive you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://kb.textdrive.com/article/disabling-mod_security&quot; title=&quot;TextDrive Knowledge Base: Disabling mod_security&quot;&gt;disable mod_security in your .htaccess file&lt;/a&gt;, or even modify the stock ruleset, but it doesn't work if you proxy lighttpd in front of their Apache, like PapaTech does.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>VPN Part 1</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/04/vpn-part-1/"/>
   <updated>2005-12-04T22:12:24+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/12/04/vpn-part-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've always been somewhat intimitated by VPNs. I've never really used them myself, being content with openssh-tunnels for my work. At my old company Netlife I inherited an IPSEC site-to-site VPN to a branch office, but I never had to touch it until we shut the office down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPN was on my initial to-do list at nu2m, and I was happy to find the open-source firewall &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.m0n0.ch/wall/&quot;&gt;m0n0wall&lt;/a&gt; with PPTP and IPSEC VPNs included onboard. We don't need VPN for our remote offices, as our provider organizes their DSL lines behind our firewall (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci1149279,00.html&quot; title=&quot;virtual routing and forwarding - a Whatis.com definition - see also: VRF, VPN routing and forwarding&quot;&gt;VRF&lt;/a&gt;, virtual routing and forwarding). PPTP works fine for individual users, they just need a username and a password, and a client is included in both Windows and OS X. I can assign them IPs and control where they can go in m0n0wall. By default the clients direct all traffic to the internet through the VPN, which is fine for occasional users. Heavy user have to set up their own routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPTP on m0n0wall has its drawbacks, though. The Berlin office had a Windows VPN server of its own, and we were never able to connect to it after they were behind the firewall. M0n0 insisted on grabbing all PPTP traffic for itself. (The workaround was to set up logins for Berlin on our VPN server.)  And we were never able to run more than 1 PPTP client behind the firewall at one time, something do with the the magic of GRE packets. As for IPSEC, I was never able to get it to work. I could connect, but I couldn't reach any hosts beyond the firewall. I suspect that with 2 firewall hosts and the VRF, our network is like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stetson.edu/~vfischer/Shrekonionlayerspage.htm&quot;&gt;Shrek's onion&lt;/a&gt;. It has too many layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have a partner that needs several clients to connect to our LAN simultaneously. PPTP doesn't cut it, because their firewall allows only 1 PPTP client at a time. So I'm going to have to overcome my intimidation and come up with a way to slice the onion. I think I've found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://openvpn.net/&quot;&gt;ginsu knife&lt;/a&gt; to do it. More on that later...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether insurance will cover the loss. A neighbor of ours works for Becker, he'll be busy the next few weeks tallying the damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/04/03/cat-content/&quot;&gt;Nena&lt;/a&gt; it looks like the Nikolaus came early!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I'm sure she brought the present herself and left it at the front door. It's been there all night, since none of us felt like picking it up last night, so it must be frozen solid by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to separate the exciting stuff from the boring stuff, I've moved all my tech-related posts to a separate weblog, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papatech.de/&quot;&gt;PapaTech&lt;/a&gt; (running on Typo under Rails). You can decide for yourself whether you find the expat/personal stuff at PapaScott to be exciting, or the hip/technical stuff at PapaTech, or neither (in which case, why are you even reading this?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try to automatically put summaries of the PapaTech posts at PapaScott, so if things break, that means it's not working yet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today on the way to judo Christopher started singing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiohamburg.de/&quot;&gt;Radio Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; jingle... and we weren't even listening to Radio Hamburg. He then said he wanted to be a radio announcer, and proceeded to give a traffic report. On the Autobahn 7 traffic was being held up by hamsters on the roadway, and the police were asking motorists to avoid running over the hamsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then said it was just a joke, and that there weren't really any hamsters on the autobahn. Too bad that radio announcing seems to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/003521.shtml&quot; title=&quot;Random radio by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com&quot;&gt;dying profession&lt;/a&gt;. I don't even listen to Radio Hamburg, although Mama sometimes turns it on. The parody this morning of Angela Merkel singing Dancing Queen on her first day in office was kind of cute, though.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We don't seem to have made an official announcement, but I can say that the 'back soon' sign at &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogstats.de/&quot;&gt;blogstats.de&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a message of disaster or impending doom. We reorganized the database, and it took longer than we thought. The database is done, the code just has to be adjusted, and I'm sure the blogstats site will be back up first thing in the morning, if not sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, obviously it's taking the coders longer than we thought to adapt to the new database setup. Data is being collected, we use the same data source at &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogg.de/&quot;&gt;blogg.de&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm sure (I hope) blogstats will be back up shortly. &lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as I posted the update, the page was reactivated. Well, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://typo.papascott.de/&quot;&gt;PapaScott on Rails&lt;/a&gt;. An experiment. About time I start checking out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; fad...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, getting Rails and FastCGI to work at my hoster wasn't all that tough. And as for &lt;a href=&quot;http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/&quot;&gt;typo&lt;/a&gt;, there's a few issues to deal with after converting the WordPress database, but I could make it work if I wanted to. And maybe I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I've taken down the test Typo blog, but I'm now using it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papatech.de/&quot;&gt;PapaTech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Things An American Can't Do In Germany: Get a Official ID Card</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/11/04/things-an-american-cant-do-in-germany-get-a-official-id-card</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/perso.jpg&quot; height=&quot;141&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; hspace=&quot;4&quot; vspace=&quot;4&quot; alt=&quot;Personalausweis&quot; title=&quot;Personalausweis&quot; /&gt; When you move to Germany, one of the things you have to get over is registering your address with the authorities, the &lt;em&gt;Einwohnermeldeamt&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, it's evil, but probably less evil than (like in the States) having your credit information available for anyone to buy. And there once you've opened a checking account, obtained a telephone, applied for a driver's license, registered to vote and filed a tax return, anyone who wants to is going to have your address anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress. Everyone here has to register their current address. But only German citizens get a plastic card that documents that, namely a &lt;em&gt;Personalausweis&lt;/em&gt; or ID card. It's pretty handy, in fact you can travel throughout most of Europe with it instead of a passport, and it is accepted as identification for just about anything for which you need to identify yourself, and it's pretty much assumed that everyone has one. That favorite American ID card, the driver's license, won't work here since German DLs never expire and don't include an address. Strangely enough, the auto registration does include a current address, but no picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But foreigners can't get a &lt;em&gt;Personalausweis&lt;/em&gt;. You need to rely on your passport and the paper receipt from the &lt;em&gt;Einwohnermeldeamt&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://justcallmemausi.blogspot.com/2005/10/and-i-didnt-even-whine-that-much.html&quot; title=&quot;Mausi: and I didn't even whine that much!&quot;&gt;Technically&lt;/a&gt; you are required to carry identification with you at all times. In 15 years, though, I've never been asked by the police for identification. Actually, I hardly ever carry my passport with me since I'm afraid I'd &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/04/30/lost-passport/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Lost Passport&quot;&gt;lose&lt;/a&gt; it. I do have a photocopy of the important pages in my billfold, and I've been told that that will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I've been asked to show my passport and registration when I least expect it, when performing suspicious and sensitive activities such as changing telephone providers, renewing my cell phone, or renting a video. Then it's a pain not to have a &lt;em&gt;Personalausweis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Here are a couple of 'before' pictures that show how high the roses were. They grow like weeds, so in a year or two they'll be that high again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Things An American Can't Do In Germany: Open An Account with Fidelity</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/11/03/things-an-american-cant-do-in-germany-open-an-account-with-fidelity/"/>
   <updated>2005-11-03T07:59:52+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/11/03/things-an-american-cant-do-in-germany-open-an-account-with-fidelity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've had an ongoing problem with our finances the past few years. Our lifestyle just hasn't been keeping pace with our (or, more correctly, &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;) income. We can't manage to spend the money that comes in during a normal month, much less keep up with the bonuses and stock options that seem to regularly turn up. Our bank has been of some help, but it hasn't been enough. So this summer when yet another bonus arrived, we decided to enlist the services of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fidelity.de/&quot;&gt;German branch of Fidelity Investments&lt;/a&gt; for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had had an account with Fidelity several years ago. One very handy thing about it was that Fidelity accepted US checks without charging any fee. At the time we still had an American bank account to pay off our last American debts, and had had some bad experiences with wire transfers. One time a thousand dollar transfer to Minnesota was lost for over 6 months; it turned out it had gotten stuck in St. Louis and noone noticed. Our Fidelity account had been closed for awhile, since we had closed all unnecessary accounts in 1999 in preparation for Mama's year-long unpaid maternity leave, so we had to reapply for an account. So we filled out application and had our identities certified by the local post office (which took over half an hour, since we had a novice clerk and I had to explain where to find the necessary data in my foreign passport). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later we received a letter rejecting our account. Fidelity Deutschland cannot do business with &quot;US persons&quot;, namely me. In fact, they said they should have never opened the original accounts (which they still had on file). Back then they didn't use PostIdent, they just took our money. Sure enough, on the last page of the Terms and Conditions was a clause regarding not opening accounts for &quot;US Persons&quot;. They suggested I open an account with Fidelity USA. However, to open an account with Fidelity USA you need an US address. So I guess expats can't do business with Fidelity, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the end Mama opened an account in her name only. It's her money anyway. The funny thing is, now they had two applications on file for us, and they ended up opening 2 accounts, one for each of us, and each with an automatic monthly investment. That was going a bit too far in solving our financial problem, and we just this week got that straightened out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Not Heart Jabberd</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/10/24/i-not-heart-jabberd/"/>
   <updated>2005-10-24T07:55:34+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/10/24/i-not-heart-jabberd</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I started last winter at nu2m, our web sites ran on One Big Server For Everything (OBSFE). It's very difficult to upgrade or do maintenance on an OBSFE, since when it breaks, everything breaks, and people tend to get upset when that happens. So my job the past few months has been to network, cluster, cajole developers to get their apps to work in a cluster, and delete all references to 'localhost' from all configuration files. (In a cluster, localhost is not what you think it is, it's a black hole, so just forget it exists.) Late last week I was finally done. Nothing more was running on the OBSFE, all websites and databases were ported, and I was free to format and reinstall the OSBFE to become an upstanding member of our cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for one thing. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/&quot;&gt;jabberd&lt;/a&gt; server. Our company depends on jabber for internal communication, and we had a jabberd on the OBSFE tied to an external IP address. Fine, I thought, just move the whole thing to a new server, put the address there, and it should work. It did, but only half way. Clients could connect, but servers could not and all transports (connections to AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo!, etc.) were broken as well. OK, back to the drawing board. I ended up setting up everything from scratch, taking a day and a half for a job I thought would take a couple of hours (and I'm not done yet), and I came to hate the beast that is jabberd. Note that the following comments are completely subjective, and may have no basis in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The jabberd server consists only of a jabber server, which is fine if you only want to talk to yourself and other jabber servers. The transports to other services are what make jabber really useful and interesting, and they are all separate little projects. Good luck finding current and working versions for them. And don't confuse &lt;a href=&quot;http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/&quot;&gt;jabberd&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/2/&quot;&gt;jabberd2&lt;/a&gt;. They are completely separate projects and have nothing to do with one another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The host setup is somewhat arcane. Jabberd works fine out of the box if you have a single box with a public IP open to everyone. Now most of us in the real world have firewalls and NAT to protect our servers, with private IPs on the servers themselves, and divide the services for a domain among several servers. Through trial and error I found a setup that worked (main hostname uses a private name, public hostnames set up as additional hosts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The latest jabberd is 1.4.4, which contains major changes to the previous 1.4.3.1. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/doc/adminguide&quot;&gt;published installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; no longer apply, and all previous transports will not compile correctly. The workaround is to complile the transports against the old versions and copy the .so files into the new version. This information seems only to be available in the mailing list archive, but is essential especially for &lt;a href=&quot;http://aim-transport.jabberstudio.org/&quot;&gt;AIM and ICQ&lt;/a&gt; to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MSN transport requires a curl library with SSL certificates. The SuSE curl packages don't include the certificates, so the transport fails with strange error messages. The are also 2 different packages you can use, a msn-transport (which we have) and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://msn-transport.jabberstudio.org/&quot;&gt;pymsn&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn't find a homepage or any current information for msn-transport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current &lt;a href=&quot;http://yahoo-transport-2.jabberstudio.org/&quot;&gt;Yahoo! transport&lt;/a&gt; contains the wrong hostname to connect to Yahoo! You have to know this, search the mailing lists for the proper hostname, and correct the configuration by hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a day and a half I'm to the point where everything seems to work from the outside and with any domain I point to the server (without using any external IPs, yay!). Now I just have to get it working for the internal network. Then I can finally get rid of the monster OBSFE!&lt;/p&gt;

It included this strange quote from a &quot;high school student&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I want something I pay for it myself. It's a question of honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article tries to make the point that the &quot;German mentality doesn't get into debt&quot;, but at the end notes that consumer bankruptcies are on the rise. They must be getting into debt somehow, probably with overdraft lines of credit at their banks and purchases from catalog merchants like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.otto.de/&quot;&gt;Otto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quelle.de/&quot;&gt;Quelle&lt;/a&gt;. Bank cards are also widely accepted, and are cheaper than credit cards for both the merchant and the consumer. They also tie in nicely with your overdraft protection. So why pay extra to get and use a credit card?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to use our credit cards a lot, but only to collect frequent flyer miles from Lufthansa.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/10/18/high-school</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I graduated in 1980. Jimmy Carter was still President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hometown is exactly 1 mile square. If in summer you stood in the middle of any street, you could see cornfields at both ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In band I played bass clarinet. Nowadays I wish I had learned bass guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was active in speech, debate and theatre. Our best play was &quot;Diary of Anne Frank&quot;. I also enjoyed doing lights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until my junior year I took the maximum number of classes possible. I then needed only one credit to graduate, and slacked off my senior year. The system was rigged; it was impossible to earn enough credits to graduate as a junior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was an AFS exchange student to Brazil the summer after my junior year. My wife was an exchange student with AFS in Minnesota. We met because we were both wearing an AFS sweatshirt at a church youth function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played tennis, but not very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had computer classes. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ldt.stanford.edu/ldt1999/Students/kemery/esc/otCompanyFrame.htm&quot; title=&quot;Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium&quot;&gt;MECC&lt;/a&gt;, even our small high school had timeshare access to a mainframe in Minneapolis. At first we typed in BASIC programs on punch cards and ran them over an acoustic couple. Later we got an Apple II where we could work locally and play Breakout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hometown lies on the 45th Parallel, exactly halfway between the North Pole and the Equator. It is also nearly equidistant from Minneapolis, Fargo and Sioux Falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my experience in Brazil, I wanted to study International Relations. I went to the University of Minnesota rather than a rural public or Lutheran college because they offered Portuguese as a foreign language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 88 students in my graduating class. Three classmates died before we graduated, one from leukemia, two in car crashes. I'm rather certain that affects me even today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a car crash myself while driving to my wife's prom. I never made it; the car was totaled, I needed stitches. She found a new date that very evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our 25th class reunion was this summer. It was two weeks after our vacation in Minnesota, so I missed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I was rooting against (the White Sox) the entire time. In fact, with the Twins out of it, my entire postseason viewing experience has essentially boiled down to rooting against the White Sox and Yankees. But hey, Chicago is four wins away from their first championship since 1917, the Twins stink, and I'm jealous. Feel free to gloat all you want, because I'm sure I'd be doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Homework Finished</title>

   <updated>2005-10-14T17:31:14+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/10/14/homework-finished</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who helped with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/10/13/homework/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Homework&quot;&gt;homework&lt;/a&gt; from yesterday. You all answered as expected and helped prove the point that our therapist was trying to make to us. A year ago our answer would have been the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural for us to associate stuttering with stress or fear. We've all had experiences where we have reacted perhaps by stuttering, or perhaps by hesitating or shuddering. Therefore, when we hear someone stutter, we project that experience onto them and immediately think of stress and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important for Christopher to know and understand. He cannot control how people will react to his stutter, and he will need to have the self-confidence to deal with the various reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is now believed that the primary cause of stuttering is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stutteringhelp.org/Default.aspx?tabid=36&quot; title=&quot;Genetic Causes&quot;&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt;. A Speech1 gene has been isolated, and it is even believed that the tendency for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stammering.org/genetic_basis.html&quot; title=&quot;The genetic basis of persistence and recovery in stuttering - British Stammering Association&quot;&gt;persistance and recovery for stutterers&lt;/a&gt; is based on genetics, although one cannot yet predict whether a given person will recover. However, early treatment is important. If stuttering persists into puberty, it will most likely persist through adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuttering is absolutely not related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stutteringhelp.org/Default.aspx?tabid=54&quot; title=&quot;Bilingual Child&quot;&gt;bilingualism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inactualfact.com/?p=155&quot;&gt;inactualfact&lt;/a&gt; wonders today why all English-language movies and TV series shown here are dubbed into German. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/08/13/ginger-rennt/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Ginger Rennt&quot;&gt;used to be bothered&lt;/a&gt; by this, but I'm not anymore, probably because most movies I watch these days are on DVD with an English soundtrack. Anybody want a useless Fargo DVD with German soundtrack only? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does bother me is that for many movies the title is completely changed in German. How is anyone supposed to know that North By Northwest in German is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=papascott-21%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.de/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00005A3G5%2526tag=papascott-21%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00005A3G5%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot;&gt;&quot;The Invisible Third&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, or that Animal House is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=papascott-21%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.de/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B00005S6SL%2526tag=papascott-21%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/B00005S6SL%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002&quot;&gt;&quot;I Think a Horse Kicked Me&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, just to name two examples. You'd think for Animal House they'd at least come up with something with food fights or cucumbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why everything is dubbed, I imagine it's because it's always been done and now the German audience expects it. Or maybe because the Nazis wanted everything in German. Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know there's some serious action going on under the covers when politicians hide from the press. That's currently the case here, where 3 weeks after the election the Union and SPD are now meeting secretly &quot;under 8 eyes&quot; to hammer out the framework of a grand coalition. There's still some squawking coming from the understudies, but the main players are &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4325600.stm&quot;&gt;keeping their mouths shut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press thinks it knows what the cabinet could look like... Merkel as Chancellor, SPD with 8 ministries. Whether Schr√∂der can get over his ego to be Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister remains to be seen (my guess is no). But once they start talking to the press again, we'll know they're done. Maybe today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2005/10/on_becoming_a_p.html&quot; title=&quot;ProfessorBainbridge.com: On Becoming a Problem Child&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://instapundit.com/archives/026033.php&quot;&gt;(via instapundit)&lt;/a&gt; made me think immediately of parties and weblogs in Germany:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have the distinct impression that the Democratic Party sees the liberal blogosphere as being inside the tent, while the Republican Party views the conservative blogosphere as being somewhere between an irrelevance and a minor nuisance. Maybe this is true, at least in part, because many prominent 'conservative' bloggers (Andrew Sullivan, Glenn Reynolds, Stephen Green, and Eugene Volokh spring to mind) are not exactly stalwart Republican party loyalists but rather libertarians (or whatever) who put routinely put their principles ahead of party interests. Alternatively, maybe the Democrats have just decided to follow Lyndon Johnson's advice about keeping your critics inside the tent peeing out rather than outside the tent peeing in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Germany here is a couple of light-years behind the US, but it's interesting that while the SPD thinks politics on the internet means &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roteblogs.de/&quot;&gt;writing weblogs&lt;/a&gt;, the CDU thinks it means &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netzeitung.de/internet/358197.html&quot;&gt;sending spam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a big step for him, and very timely. His speech therapist has suggested that the time is right for us as parents to become directly involved with his therapy, for us to start attending some sessions and actively participate. We know that she's told him that &quot;Mama and Papa want to help&quot;. It's a wonderful sign that he trusts us and himself enough to ask directly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Drupal and me</title>

   <updated>2005-10-03T19:18:34+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/10/03/drupal-and-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend I've been working with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/&quot; title=&quot;drupal open-source content management platform&quot;&gt;Drupal CMS platform&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://naturheilzentrumdrochtersen.de/&quot; title=&quot;Naturheilzentrum Drochtersen - Kirsten Kruse und Roland Petersen&quot;&gt;Naturheilzentrum Drochtersen&lt;/a&gt; website that I set up for my brother- and sister-in-law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at a number of packages. I've been away from Movable Type too long to be able to shoehorn it into a traditional CMS. The page feature in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; was not sophisticated enough for the 4 layers of menus and approx. 50 pages. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joomla.org/&quot;&gt;Mambo/Joomla&lt;/a&gt; seemed too inflexible for the given layout and menu struction. With Drupal the first hurdle is the documentation; I was unable to find a simple howto to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got into it, I found that Drupal could do 90% of what I needed, which is as good as anyone could hope for. I'm going to have to fiddle with the menu code get the highlighting right, but the functions are &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupaldocs.org/api/4.6/group/themeable&quot;&gt;'themeable'&lt;/a&gt; and there's a well-documented (although somewhat convoluted) &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupaldocs.org/&quot; title=&quot;API reference | drupaldocs.org&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One stumbling block is that the layout for the website and the admin interface are the same, so I had to do a lot a CSS fiddling to import an existing layout without breaking the admin interface. A nice feature is the wide choice of theme engines; simple tags were not enough for me, however with &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/phptemplate&quot;&gt;PHPTemplate&lt;/a&gt; I was able to implement what I needed in PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://naturheilzentrumdrochtersen.de/&quot; title=&quot;Naturheilzentrum Drochtersen - Kirsten Kruse und Roland Petersen&quot;&gt;live site&lt;/a&gt; still contains static pages from City Desk, but once the menus are tamed I'll be able to put the Drupal site online.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/09/29/big-big-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seeing how my &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/&quot; title=&quot;Lummaland - das Weblog&quot;&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; and some colleagues current are &lt;a href=&quot;http://umzug.lumma.de/&quot; title=&quot;Umzugsblog&quot;&gt;moving&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ichbinharmlos.de/blog/&quot; title=&quot;bloggbox %u2014 fab1An&quot;&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; Cologne (&lt;a href=&quot;http://couchblog.de/webpropaganda/&quot; title=&quot;Webpropaganda&quot;&gt;or&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://ameisendorf.de/&quot; title=&quot;ameisendorf.de&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;), I can't but think back on our big move...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 1987, and we were happy young urban professionals in South Minneapolis. We owned a townhouse, my wife had a good job, and I was in grad school. Then the Twins won the World Series, and everything changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had nothing to do with the Twins, of course. But as the playoffs started that fall, my wife's boss announced he was selling the business and moving to Arizona, taking his supervisor and several low-level employees with him. My wife's position would remain with the new owner, she was in effect sold with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the same time, I realized that I didn't really want to be an economics professor when I grew up, dropped out of grad school, and started working in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things did not work out with my wife's new boss. All her friends were in Arizona, happy in the land of sun and fun. We were unhappy and jealous. Her old boss didn't have a job for her, but he would be expanding real soon and she could perhaps work a few months for an acquaintance of his until he was ready for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our young urban townhouse was just a bit too urban. We were on the fringe of a drug neighborhood, and while police raids with bulldozers on crack houses are exciting to watch, they don't do much for property values. Having financed 95% of the purchase price, the townhouse was now worth much less than what we owed. We couldn't afford to sell, even more so with our student loan and credit card debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we wanted to leave, but we didn't have jobs and couldn't sell our house. So what did we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left, in May 1989. We left the house with my brother, packed 3 cats and everything we owned into a U-Haul, and drove to Wickenburg, Arizona, a desert nest on the road from Phoenix to Las Vegas where we could work for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job with the old boss never materialized, we ended up losing the townhouse (we sent the bank the keys and let them foreclose), and we had arrived in Arizona just in time for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_Loan_crisis&quot;&gt;Savings and Loan bust&lt;/a&gt; and recession. So moving to Arizona was the dumbest thing we could have done, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong, it was the smartest. In Arizona we made the connection that brought us to Germany. In August 1990 we once again packed everything we owned, this time into a shipping container, and we and the 3 cats boarded a plane for Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a Social Liberal (85% permissive) and an Economic Conservative (66% permissive) You are best described as a: &lt;b&gt;Libertarian&lt;/b&gt;.  You exhibit a very well-developed sense of Right and Wrong and believe in economic fairness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It turned out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/08/09/bad-tickets/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott &amp;raquo; Blog Archive &amp;raquo; Bad Tickets&quot;&gt;luxury lounge HSV tickets&lt;/a&gt; for the match against Bayern weren't so bad after all. We did have seats outside, so we didn't have to stay in the lounge. And the home team &lt;a href=&quot;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/soccer/wires/09/24/2080.ap.eu.spt.soc.german.roundup/index.html&quot; title=&quot;SI.com - Hamburg ends Bayern's record streak with 2-0 win&quot;&gt;ended up winning&lt;/a&gt;, beating Bayern for the first time since 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my first HSV match &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/25/monkey-noises/&quot;&gt;since 1990&lt;/a&gt;. I was very impressed by the atmosphere in the AOL Arena this time, and I'll probably go again (even without the luxury business lounge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's tickets were a gift for Mama's nephew, a huge Bayern fan (who was of course deeply disappointed by the result). Christopher and I were supposed to chaperone, but when Christopher turned out not to be interested, we had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=2107&quot; title=&quot;HSV ol√© [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot;&gt;ticket left over&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://frederikesophie.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=226&quot; title=&quot;HSV-Mampf [Frederike Sophie]&quot;&gt;Rike&lt;/a&gt; seemed to enjoy the buffet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I Want to be a Strong Knight!</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/09/21/i-want-to-be-a-strong-knight</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/45382175/&quot; title=&quot;I want to be a strong knight!&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/24/45382175_691863020e.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;IMG_0414&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher drew this castle for his speech therapist to show how he feels about stuttering. He wants to be a strong knight! He wants to be able to defeat the words that sometimes come at him like cannonballs being shot in the heat of battle. He wants to be a strong fighter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He never speaks this directly to us, or if he does, we're simply too close to him to pick up the message. He and I did have a good laugh the other day. I was reading to him and stumbled over some long German word. I made a funny noise and tried to start over, but he started laughing and I just had to join in. He knew how I felt, and he knew I that knew how he feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our role in his therapy is to let him be strong as much as we can, to create situations where he can feel strong and to try to avoid situations where he feels weak and becomes discouraged. One thing we are trying is sport. The kindergarten suggested that we enroll him in some local afternoon activity to give him contact with other kids, kids not part of the sheltered kindergarten. We thought about art, or music, or a group sport like soccer. But once we heard that he wants to be a strong knight, we decided to follow through on the fighting theme and to try judo. There's a&lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.blau-weiss-buchholz.de/sportarten/judo.html&quot;&gt; group in Buchholz&lt;/a&gt; for 4-6 year olds on Wednesdays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher was skeptical at first, but now after 4 weeks he's agreed that it's fun to run around on the mats, and to throw and to be thrown. It also helped that we told him that judo is a good sport for astronauts, since that's his current 'what I want to be when I grow up'. We're sure it will help him deal with those verbal cannonballs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

This morning his speech therapist suggested that shaving cream would be the perfect material for a snowplow to, well, plow, so of course he had to try that out this evening &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/sets/985240/show/&quot;&gt;(slideshow)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was something surreal about Gerhard Schr&amp;ouml;der's appearence on national television last night. Although his party was second in the polls, Schr&amp;ouml;der saw the victory quite clearly as his own. And anyone who saw matters differently, an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both SPD and Union lost several percent compared to 2002, neither Red/Green nor Block/Yellow has a majority. The big winners are the neo-liberal FDP (over 10%) and the neo-socialist Left/PDS (over 8%). The most likely result is a grand coalition of Union and SPD, a coalition of losers. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we visited a new McCafe in Elmshorn, northwest of Hamburg. It's a coffee bar inside a regular McDonald's restaurant, and the idea is relatively new in Germany, although it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050724/COLUMNISTS02/507240442/1035&quot; title=&quot;Broad Ripple McCafe making a fast-food exit&quot;&gt;apparently hasn't gone over well in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Here they seem to be redoing the entire restaurant rather than creating a separate coffee area. In Elmshorn you sit on leather seats whether you are eating a Big Mac or drinking a Latte.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The head of Der Spiegel's Berlin bureau sums up Germany's budget dilemma in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,374770,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Wall Street Journal: Say it Slowly: 'Zukunftsangst' - International - SPIEGEL ONLINE - News&quot;&gt;Wall Street Journal: Say it Slowly: 'Zukunftsangst'&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A glance at the state's finances shows how dramatic the situation is: Of 190 billion euros in tax revenues, 80 billion is passed on to the cash-strapped state pension system, 30 billion goes to the unemployed, and another 40 billion belongs to the banks, just to service debt. The rest is not even enough to pay the bureaucracy and to build roads. Ever-new credits are constantly needed so that Germany at least has the appearance of a prosperous country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the politicians never put it this directly, and the press only very rarely. It reminds me of the quietest room in hell. Everyone stands in a vat of raw sewage up to the lower lip, and the only sound is a mass whisper. &quot;Don't make waves. Don't make waves....&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/006327.html&quot; title=&quot;vowe dot net :: Haben Sie Angst?&quot;&gt;(via vowe)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They began jumping not long after the first plane hit the North Tower, not long after the fire started. They kept jumping until the tower fell. They jumped through windows already broken and then, later, through windows they broke themselves. They jumped to escape the smoke and the fire; they jumped when the ceilings fell and the floors collapsed; they jumped just to breathe once more before they died. They jumped continually, from all four sides of the building, and from all floors above and around the building's fatal wound. They jumped from the offices of Marsh &amp;amp; McLennan, the insurance company; from the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond-trading company; from Windows on the World, the restaurant on the 106th and 107th floors - the top. For more than an hour and a half, they streamed from the building, one after another, consecutively rather than en masse, as if each individual required the sight of another individual jumping before mustering the courage to jump himself or herself. One photograph, taken at a distance, shows people jumping in perfect sequence, like parachutists, forming an arc composed of three plummeting people, evenly spaced. Indeed, there were reports that some tried parachuting, before the force generated by their fall ripped the drapes, the tablecloths, the desperately gathered fabric, from their hands. They were all, obviously, very much alive on their way down, and their way down lasted an approximate count of ten seconds. They were all, obviously, not just killed when they landed but destroyed, in body though not, one prays, in soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I can read the entire article without breaking down. I hope that's because I've become harder and not because I've forgotten the day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One disadvantage of living so far from kindergarten in Winsen is the long bus ride. Christopher is first on his route, so while kindergarten starts at 8:30, last year he would be picked up at 7:15. And Christopher is absolutely not a morning person. Good thing that breakfast is served in kindergarten, so he could sleep until 5 to seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year a new out-of-the-way stop was added to his route, and the driver asked if he could come at 7:00 the first day. That was fine with us for one day, except it turned out not to be just one day, but every day, dragging Christopher out of bed at 6:40. We finally asked the kindergarten Tuesday evening if they could rearrange things. They didn't know Christopher was being picked up even earlier than before, but noticed that he was more tired than usual. The next day they had a new plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are now basically sending a bus just for Christopher. The other stops for the bus are right in Winsen, so Christopher now rides nonstop from Jesteburg to Winsen. He rode the new bus for the first time yesterday  afternoon, arriving 15 minutes earlier than usual. I asked the driver when she wanted to pick Christopher up this morning, and she asked if 7:30 would be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:30. An extra half-hour of sleep. We're in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Could This Happen in New Orleans?</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/09/04/how-could-this-happen-in-new-orleans/"/>
   <updated>2005-09-04T06:41:08+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/09/04/how-could-this-happen-in-new-orleans</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People in here Germany (she for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/&quot;&gt;vowe&lt;/a&gt; for the past few days) how the chaos in New Orleans can happen in a highly-developed first-world country? One answer is that New Orleans was not in real good shape even before Katrina. At &lt;a href=&quot;http://11d.typepad.com/blog/2005/09/things_get_wors.html&quot; title=&quot;11D: Things Get Worse&quot;&gt;11D&lt;/a&gt; I saw a quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.city-journal.org/html/eon_08_31_05ng.html&quot; title=&quot;Will New Orleans Recover? by Nicole Gelinas&quot;&gt;Nicole Gelinas of City Journal&lt;/a&gt; (a conservative urban planning journal) that seems to sum things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the locals and outsiders who try to help New Orleans in the weeks and months to come will do so with no local institutional infrastructure to back them up. New Orleans has no real competent government or civil infrastructure&amp;mdash;and no aggressive media or organized citizens&amp;rsquo; groups to prod public officials in the right direction during what will be, in the best-case scenario, a painstaking path to normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that even on a normal day, New Orleans is a sad city. Sure, tourists think New Orleans is fun: you can drink and hop from strip club to strip club all night on Bourbon Street, and gamble all your money away at Harrah&amp;rsquo;s. But the city&amp;rsquo;s decline over the past three decades has left it impoverished and lacking the resources to build its economy from within. New Orleans can&amp;rsquo;t take care of itself even when it is not 80 percent underwater; what is it going to do now, as waters continue to cripple it, and thousands of looters systematically destroy what Katrina left unscathed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no personal experience with New Orleans, I've never been there, but it's no coincidence that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092654/&quot; title=&quot;The Big Easy (1987)&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091637/&quot; title=&quot;No Mercy (1986)&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088272/&quot; title=&quot;Tightrope (1984)&quot;&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt; that came to my mind set in New Orleans all involve corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

I couldn't plug it into my old PowerBook, so I had to get a Mac Mini &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyberport.de/webshop/?DEEP=1005-129&quot;&gt;(1.42 GHz / Combo Drive)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously 'santana' (as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlbpa/players/6441&quot;&gt;Johan&lt;/a&gt;) will be a nice companion to the 500 MHz PowerBook &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1638&amp;amp;tag=papascott-21&amp;amp;creative=6742&amp;amp;path=ASIN%2F0393324818&quot;&gt;'moneyball'&lt;/a&gt;. It has some amenities that moneyball lacks, and is small enough to move around the house if I want to use it upstairs. Managing music will be easier with a single machine for both Slimserver and iTunes (syncing an iPod via 802.11b is a pain). And thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redstonesoftware.com/vnc.html&quot; title=&quot;VNC&quot;&gt;OSXvnc&lt;/a&gt; I don't even have to sit in front of santana to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up santana was pretty boring. Just plug in a mouse and keyboard (PC keyboard works just fine) and it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fred Krause Miles Per Gallon is defined as the mileage obtained by a vehicle traveling 85 miles per hour with the air conditioner set on 'MAX.' My Camaro got nearly 35 FKMPG. My Blazer? Closer to 20. An even more useful measure is MPD (miles ger dollar), which turns it all into dollars. Until recently, I was getting a fairly solid 10 MPD, but the uptick in gas prices has wrecked that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/21/used-car/&quot;&gt;Lupo&lt;/a&gt; gets 5 l/100 km at 0.99&amp;euro; per l of biodiesel, which at $1.20 per Euro works out to exactly 10 MPD. So I can't complain!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/08/10/moving-blog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My boss will be moving to Cologne this fall, and since he sees weblogs as the solution to all of life's problems, he has started a &lt;a href=&quot;http://umzug.lumma.de/&quot; title=&quot;Umzugsblog&quot;&gt;moving blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving is somewhat like sex... Americans do it better and more often. I've moved 12 times in my adult life, including cross-country and trans-continental, and 8 times since getting married (we can attest that moving is a good stress test for any relationship, although not nearly as good as building a house together). Moving is somewhat easier in the States since American apartments tend to include amenities like closets, floor covering, light fixtures and a kitchen, and are usually available (and can be vacated) at short notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer a specific question: &lt;a href=&quot;http://umzug.lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=20&quot; title=&quot;Praktische &amp;Uuml;berlegungen&quot;&gt;how long can one live without a kitchen?&lt;/a&gt; Answer: 10 weeks. Due to the physical constraints of the space-time continuum, when we moved to Germany we brought 4 suitcases and 3 cats with us on the plane and our furniture arrived 10 weeks later. We first moved temporarily into a unrenovated 6th-floor apartment in downtown Kiel, our first experience without the aforementioned amenities of closets, floor covering, light fixtures and a kitchen. We begged, borrowed, and bought from 2nd hand shops, and somehow survived until the container with our furniture arrived and found a permanent apartment in Hamburg. We'd never want to do it again, but if we had to we'd skip the shipping container and instead set up a credit line at Ikea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time we didn't yet have a child, which I imagine would increase the number of problems by at least a power of 2.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife's company has been sponsoring the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsv.de/&quot;&gt;local soccer team&lt;/a&gt; for I don't know how many years now, and today for the first time she brought home match tickets. But somehow I don't think the tickets are very good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the match is against &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fcbayern.t-com.de/de/index.php&quot; title=&quot;FC Bayern M&amp;uuml;nchen&quot;&gt;Bayern M&amp;uuml;nchen&lt;/a&gt;, a team they haven't beaten in years and a match they are sure to lose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for another thing, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsv.de/index.php?id=8817&quot; title=&quot;Hamburger SV: Business-Seats West&quot;&gt;seats are behind glass&lt;/a&gt; and pretty far from the playing field. I'm sure we won't be able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsv.de/index.php?id=12814&quot;&gt;see or hear well&lt;/a&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the tickets didn't cost us anything, so I guess we should be happy that we'll be going to a game at all. At least they are for a league match and not for some &lt;a href=&quot;http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/&quot;&gt;meaningless international tournament&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign season started while we were away, and this billboard now stands in front of our local supermarket. &quot;We stand for the courage to wage peace. But what do the others stand for?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not exactly sure which war the SPD is claiming to have prevented. If they mean Iraq, that certainly didn't work, and sticking one's head in the sand and pretending a problem doesn't exist doesn't exactly require courage. What they really mean is &quot;We stood up to Bush&quot;, implying that Angela Merkel wouldn't have. It's a whiff of anti-Americanism, and it will be interesting to see if the SPD takes it any further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other interesting thing is the ruling party chose not to use a photo of their candidate, even though Gerhard Schr√∂der is personally more popular than Merkel. Which party is the challenger here? Then again, it's a strange election, where neither party wants to be the incumbant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of a series of &quot;What do the others stand for?&quot; slogans... other issues the SPD &quot;stands for&quot; include &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-wendler/31724237/in/pool-wahl05/&quot;&gt;job protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ix/31256013/in/pool-wahl05/&quot;&gt;reform&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-wendler/31131636/in/pool-wahl05/&quot;&gt;modern family policy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebastian-wendler/31130961/in/pool-wahl05/&quot;&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>Vacation Impressions</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/08/05/vacation-impressions/"/>
   <updated>2005-08-05T12:38:19+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/08/05/vacation-impressions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I skipped blogging while we were in Minnesota, I'll list my impressions here (and keep adding new points as I think of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you travel to the Midwest in July, you have to expect storms. Thunderstorms cancelled our flight from Chicago to Minneapolis, so we spent an unexpected 6 hours at O'Hare. A couple days later, a windstorm knocked out power to the cabin for 11 hours, which made cooking for guests, well, interesting. It takes a long time to boil water on a gas grill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My wife thinks Minnesotans are boring because they always talk about the weather, but Minnesota weather &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a lot more interesting than German weather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were too far from the Interstate for GSM reception, so our cell phones were basically useless. On the other hand, the town did have broadband, and we could sniff out some WiFi connections to read mail when we felt like it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small town radio sucks, since the programming is now beamed in from afar and the only local content are the commercials. We could only receive 1 TV station, so we didn't watch much TV either. We brought a stack of DVDs expecting to be bored, but we didn't watch a single one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We didn't bring up politics, but everyone we talked to who did seemed to be against the war and knew someone stationed with a National Guard unit in Iraq.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I managed to mostly stick to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/07/08/change-for-the-better/&quot;&gt;diet and exercise plan&lt;/a&gt; and lost 3 kg while we were there. I still have a couple dozen kilos to lose, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christopher got to fish and drive the boat, which he's been looking forward to since Christmas. He even got to ride a few times on a 4-wheeled ATV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We saw one of these &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2005/08/02/like_coke_machine_for_dvds/&quot; title=&quot;Like Coke machine for DVDs - The Boston Globe - Boston.com - Personal Tech - Business&quot;&gt;Redbox DVD kiosks&lt;/a&gt; at a local McDonald's. We didn't realize Redbox was owned by McD. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intuitive.com/blog/the_next_evolutionary_step_in_dvd_rentals_redbox.html&quot; title=&quot;'The next evolutionary step in DVD rentals: Redbox' from The Intuitive Life Business Blog&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lufthansa check-in desk at O'Hare was a catastrophe. But the Lufthansa pilot invited Christopher into the cockpit in Frankfurt, which more than made up for the inconvenience in Chicago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

And when it doesn't refill itself the first night, it's because the jar has &quot;lost its powers&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

This time it was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netzwelt.de/news/71901_1-kolumne-stoppt-die-blogexhibitionisten.html&quot; title=&quot;Kolumne: Stoppt die Blog-Exhibitionisten!&quot;&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netzwelt.de/&quot; title=&quot;netzwelt.de - Computernews, Testberichte, Software und MP3 Downloads&quot;&gt;netzwelt.de&lt;/a&gt; that asserted that most weblogs are crap, although there are a few good ones. So what? That's true of anything, even online columns. Of course, crap is in the eyes of the beholder, and one person's crap is another person's treasure. The column mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://umstandsmoden.blogg.de/&quot; title=&quot;Umstandsmode, Schwangerschaft, Geburt und Stillen, Baby und Kind ...&quot;&gt;maternity wear&lt;/a&gt; as a topic that interests noone. But if you happen to be in the fashion industry or are perhaps pregnant, the tips could be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So was the netzwelt article itself crap? I thought it might have been funny, except Germans don't do &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1873&quot; title=&quot;UEK-Fanclub [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot;&gt;irony&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was Christopher's last kindergarten day for the year. It was a bit sad since the two leaders of his clique won't be coming back, and it was also the last day for his favorite &lt;i&gt;Zivi&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dict.cc/?s=Zivildienstleistender&quot; title=&quot;conscientious objector performing community service&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Zivildienstleistender&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Today was the end-of-year fest, and now he has 3-1/2 weeks off. Next year his group will have 8 instead of 9 kids, and the funding for kindergarten will be reduced proportionally (thanks to Christian Wulff's social budget cuts in Niedersachsen... funny how he dropped out of the news after new elections were proposed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Christopher can look forward to flying to see Grandma and Grandpa, and going fishing in Grandpa's boat. Mama and Papa are looking forward to that too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We'll be flying to Minnesota next week and spending two weeks on Lake Minnewaska at my parents' lake house near &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starbuckmn.org/&quot; title=&quot;Starbuck Minnesota USA - City and Chamber of Commerce&quot;&gt;Starbuck&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starbucks.com/&quot;&gt;coffee shop chain&lt;/a&gt;). I just realized that they no longer have a telephone at the lake, since they have a cell phone. And I doubt that Starbuck (without the final s) has WiFi. I guess that means that posting to PapaScott will be fairly light while we are there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we won't be getting any pesky emails from our respective employers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We spent the weekend (precisely 27 hours, to be exact) in Berlin, finally using that luxury hotel gift certificate that I had received for my birthday. We did a lot of touristy things, but not at real fast pace as we had a 5-year-old in tow. The highlight on Saturday was coffee with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/&quot;&gt;J&amp;ouml;rg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gabi-kantel.de/&quot;&gt;Gabi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://zebu.server-wg.de/&quot;&gt;Zebu&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a walk through  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baulueckenmanagement/en/informationen/neukoelln/index.shtml&quot;&gt;Neuk&amp;ouml;lln&lt;/a&gt;, where in the modern city there are still many signs of the old Bohemian village (as well as a couple of nice playgrounds for Christopher). On Sunday morning we queued up to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/info/050vberl.html&quot;&gt;Dome atop the Reichstag building&lt;/a&gt;. We had imagined a closed dome that was part of the session hall, but it fact it's a separate open-air structure, and we spent over an hour there enjoying the breeze and the view. We then took a cruise in the sunshine on the Spree river and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Change for the Better</title>

   <updated>2005-07-08T01:04:46+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/07/08/change-for-the-better</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The good news is: I don't have &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2&quot;&gt;Diabetes mellitus type 2&lt;/a&gt;. The flip side is: I'm well on my way to getting it unless I change my lifestyle, fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister-in-law is a &lt;i&gt;Heilpraktikerin&lt;/i&gt; (alternative practitioner) together with her husband, and I've been helping them with their website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naturheilzentrumdrochtersen.de/&quot;&gt;Naturheilzentrum Drochtersen&lt;/a&gt;. She's started offering a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stoffwechselprogramm.com/&quot; title=&quot;gesund &amp;amp; aktiv - Pers&amp;ouml;nliches Stoffwechselprogramm&quot;&gt;weight-loss program&lt;/a&gt; based on optimizing metabolism, and suggested we both start the program together. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index&quot;&gt;Body Mass Index&lt;/a&gt; is 35, so I could use such a program quite badly (I'm 174 cm tall, I'll let you do the math).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is a comprehensive blood analysis, so she stopped by a couple weeks ago and took our weights and a dozen vials of blood. Among the blood tests was glucose, and mine was at 129 mg/dl, over the healthy maximum. A big yellow flashing warning signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure I didn't really already have diabetes, I went in yesterday for a sugar load test. Drink a cup of sugar water on an empty stomach and check the glucose after 1 and 2 hours. My glucose was way too high after 1 hour, but was OK again after 2 hours. My pancreas is still working, but it's under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have a list of about 40 foods I am allowed to eat, all with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index&quot;&gt;glycemic indices&lt;/a&gt; of 50 or less. I need to eat at least 750 g of vegetables and drink 3.5 l of water per day. I need to plan at least 4 hours between meals, and eat no carbohydrates on an empty stomach. I need to take vitamins and spoonful of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linseed_oil&quot;&gt;linseed oil&lt;/a&gt; daily. And I need to exercise. I've invested in a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karstadt.de/produktAnzeigen.do?pfad=2973+748244+748245+748269&amp;amp;pid=2556242&quot; title=&quot;Asics Gel Foundation Plus&quot;&gt;running shoes&lt;/a&gt;, and I've started using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the initial blood test I've lost nearly 2 kg, so it looks like I'm on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I watched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4639781.stm&quot; title=&quot;BBC NEWS | Europe | Germany heads for early elections&quot;&gt;confidence vote in the Bundestag&lt;/a&gt; this morning, hoping to watch a historical event. I haven't watched a government slowly disintegrate since Nixon resigned, and this being Germany the unraveling of the Red/Green coalition is taking place in painfully slow motion. But the debate and the vote were short and disappointing. It was almost like business as usual, and it had the feel of a planned and staged event. Probably because it was, except for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,363215,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Historische Bundestagssitzung: Aggressiver Wahlkampfauftakt am V-Tag - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten&quot;&gt;Werner Schulz's speech&lt;/a&gt; describing the process as the farce that it was.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/06/30/chaos-management</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week we're painting and laying flooring upstairs or, more correctly, having it done. However, the carpenter is behind, he's only half done, and is flying off on vacation next week. Currently all rooms upstairs are impassable, except (thank God!) the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cleaning lady also comes on Thursday. (Notice how we outsource much of our work.) With the work upstairs today, she can only do the downstairs and the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Christopher woke up today with fever and a cough, so we kept him at home with me. We're staying downstairs with Christopher's Playmobil figures, the carpenter is upstairs, and the cleaning lady is pulling weeds outside. House cleaning is postponed until next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally one would go to work to escape such chaos, but since I work from home, there is no escape, even if Christopher weren't sick.&lt;/p&gt;

Ever since Christopher discovered the online games, it's even more popular than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.superrtl.de/&quot;&gt;Super RTL&lt;/a&gt; (children's TV channel half-owned by Disney and scourge of responsible German parents). His current favorite is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playmobil.de/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/de/-/DEM/PM_ViewAbout-Start;sid=fddynYMWMftylMGqlWCxEt_DDX3t4I9T_Ys=?PM_Template=Static%2fgames%2fScreenshots%2fGame13_redjack%2eisml&amp;amp;PHL=RED%20JACK%20-%20DER%20SCHRECKEN%20DER%20L%FCFTE&amp;amp;PLS=0&quot; title=&quot;Red Jack - Der Schrecken der L&amp;uuml;fte&quot;&gt;Red Jack&lt;/a&gt;, in which you aim a cannonball-riding pirate to land in a rowboat. I think that might be teaching Christopher about geometry and physics, but Mama doubts that a 5-year-old can understand much about angles and acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent a summer in Brazil as an exchange student, but was only 16 and missed out on some of the finer points. &lt;a href=&quot;http://accordionguy.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/6/20/957748.html&quot; title=&quot;The Adventures of Accordion Guy in the 21st Century :: Joey deVilla's Weblog :: The Girls from Ipanema are Not Impressed&quot;&gt;Brazilian women on American men&lt;/a&gt;: in short, too shy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask Brazilian women what they think about American men, and most respond precisely the same way: with gales of laughter. Then they tell disturbingly similar tales of men who fear making advances lest they be accused of date rape and who coldly calculate how many days they need to wait between meeting a woman and asking her to dinner...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women pointed out, American men have other good qualities - their faithfulness, for example. Brazilian women often say that Brazilian men are safados - shameless - and love to chase the fairer sex. Americans actually mean what they say (at least more often than Brazilians do). And they are sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So whom would they rather date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Brazilians,' said Ms. Franca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Brazilians,' said Ms. Vianna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I've been gone too long to know any of them, except for a kid I used to babysit (he's now 35, a teacher and father of two).  The Economist this week noted that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/world/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4085684&quot; title=&quot;The war on terror | That not-winning feeling | Economist.com&quot;&gt;opinion in the US is shifting&lt;/a&gt; against the war.

   <title>Terminal Panic</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/06/14/terminal-panic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The airport F&amp;uuml;hlsb&amp;uuml;ttel in Hamburg used to have Terminals 1 (charter), 2 and 3. Then they built a new Terminal 4. The ancient Terminal 2 was torn down to build a second new terminal. The entire airport was renamed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hamburg-airport.de/&quot;&gt;Hamburg Airport&lt;/a&gt;. Terminal 3 was then closed to be rebuilt into a shopping center. Last month the new terminal on the site of Terminal 2 was named Terminal 1, the old Terminal 1 was closed, and Terminal 4 was renamed Terminal 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, from which terminal does tomorrow's 9:55 flight to Munich take off?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Oral Exams</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/06/13/oral-exams</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly a year ago Christopher &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/06/17/expert-opinion/&quot;&gt;met with the state speech expert&lt;/a&gt; to be approved for his speech therapy kindergarten for one year. Today was the follow-up meeting to be approved for an additional six months. While we had been assured by the kindergarten that an extension would be no problem, since the extension would be mostly based on their written report, we were nonetheless nervous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We needn't have worried. While he has made excellent progress the past year, his stutter is still very pronounced, especially in stress situations. However, he's smart, outgoing and self-confident, and he usually does not become flustered by his stutter, but just keeps on talking. Self-confidence is 90% of the battle. The expert approved the extension, and was already giving us advice for school next year, recommending a regular 1st grade class (with therapy on the side) rather than a special ed group, specifically because Christopher is so sure of himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting along with us, one of the mothers told us this was just like waiting for oral exams for the &lt;em&gt;Abitur&lt;/em&gt;. That didn't seem that far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Rose From Christopher</title>

   <updated>2005-06-12T05:36:56+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/06/12/a-rose-from-christopher</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rosen-direct.de/shop/catalog/images/jubile_du_prince_de_monaco.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;jubile_du_prince_de_monaco.jpg&quot; src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/jubile_du_prince_de_monaco.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This year I thought I had the problem of Mama's birthday present licked. I'd let Christopher take care of it! I had asked him early in the week what we should get, and he immediately answered &quot;A rose&quot;. The perfect answer, since Mama loves her garden and she would love any present that came from Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when it came time to go to the garden shop on Thursday to pick one out, Christopher participated only unwillingly (he was sulking because I wouldn't let him play on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playmobil.de/&quot;&gt;Playmobil web site&lt;/a&gt; until after supper). However, with the promise of an ice cream bar, he did come along and immediately picked out a classical &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rosen-direct.de/shop/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/449&quot;&gt;Jubilee du Prince de Monaco&lt;/a&gt; rose bush. However, that didn't end his sulk. I hid the rose in our back yard and waited for Mama's birthday on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday morning, it was wet and windy outside and Christopher couldn't be dragged away from his knight and dragon playthings. I had hoped that we would give Mama her rose together, but he just blurted out &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and headed back to his room. I was left alone to head out in the rain to get the rose and explain to Mama the story.  She seemed to enjoy it, but it wasn't quite the effect I had hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile today we have the family birthday (Mama and two nephews) celebration. We were planning an American-style barbecue, however we have a streak of attracting rain showers every time we plan to barbecue. So instead of cooking on the patio we will be shivering in the carport. Again.&lt;/p&gt;

Things work smoothly and technology is generally advanced. That's to be expected in the richest nation on earth. What's not expected is the number of areas where US technology compares woefully to poor, benighted Britain: the structure of mobile telephony, the comparative underdevelopment of digital television, the absence of digital radio and congestion charging are the four things that spring immediately to mind.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; In the middle of the sixth inning Tuesday night... the (black) cat bolted from its underground quarters, crossed in front of the Cubs' dugout and leapt into the third-base box seats before security guards could corral it...

&lt;p&gt;This is almost as weird as current German politics. Maybe Schr&amp;ouml;der should start releasing black cats from the Kanzleramt.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if you can't read German, her picture in the sandbox leads the story on the web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the story was rather sensationalist, how a unregulated Tagesmutter in Munich used sleeping pills to control the toddlers in her care. Heidi was presented as what a Tagesmutter should be, as well a spokesperson for her professional organization. The film team spent several hours with her, so maybe they will use the material for a future report. Today she was shown for one minute, at the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story, however, ended on a sexist note, as the reporter noted how many working women depend on Tagesm&amp;uuml;tter... as if fathers had no interest in day care at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/06/02/experience-not-required</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about Angela Merkel, newly annointed CDU/CSU Chancellor candidate, that I haven't seen anyone mention is that she's never before been actually elected to anything. I don't mean her seat in the Bundestag, I mean to an office where she actually leads a campaign and runs a government, for instance as a mayor or state premier. Leading German politicians have generally cut their teeth at the state level. In fact, I couldn't think of German chancellor candidate who didn't have such experience... I had to turn to Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first guess was &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Jochen_Vogel&quot;&gt;Hans-Jochen Vogel&lt;/a&gt; in 1983, but I was wrong. I knew he had been mayor of Munich, but he was also mayor of Berlin... only for 6 months, but Berlin is a state so that counts. The last chancellor candidate without any experience running a state was &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Barzel&quot;&gt;Rainer Barzel&lt;/a&gt;, who lost to Willy Brandt in 1972. The only German Chancellor who, like Merkel, had never been mayor or state premier was&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Erhard&quot;&gt;Ludwig Erhard&lt;/a&gt;, not a particularly good Chancellor who lasted just 3 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merkel has done well leading the CDU, taming Stoiber and Koch, but does she actually have the experience to run an election and lead a country?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized after we parted ways that we didn't take any pictures of one another, so you'll just have to take our words for it that we had a good time. We still have no idea, though, why there is a Southern-style riverboat in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I don't have to drive in, since my boss bravely volunteered to turned things back on. I just have to make sure everything works. But I'd rather be grilling.&lt;/p&gt;

It presents a lot of detail without being overwhelming. It's intended to &quot;inform rather than persuade&quot;, but it's hard to disagree with the conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has happened &amp;mdash; a slow slide from coherent, consistent standards for interrogation and treatment of prisoners to a sometimes ad-hoc, occasionally brutal search for information at all costs &amp;mdash; should warrant public outcry. That it has not suggests either that this shift doesn't interest us because it affects outsiders, or that we no longer consider torture or near-torture to be beyond the bounds of civil conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I paraphrase: &quot;In my 1 year blogging career I've never seen so many political blog postings. I would find it almost revolutionary if this would continue. It would be fantistic if we could get a little bit away from our we-can't-do-anything-about-it-anyway mentality and blog a little bit about politics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, a revolution? In Germany? Nah, it will never happen...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karl talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://chicagokarl.de/2005/05/18/pfingstbaumpflanzen&quot; title=&quot;pfingstbaumpflanzen&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pfingstbaumpflanzen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or planting trees for Pentecost. In his village the young men bring trees to the young women, drinking Schnapps along the way. Here the young men bring trees to every house, and sing in exchange for schnapps. This year they came to us quite late, after 9 pm, and were by then quite woozey. I was afraid we'd have to have to call a street sweeper (but we did finish off a bottle of dogrose schnapps we'd had open for a while).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/06/12/pentecost/&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/05/30/pentecost-singers/&quot;&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/10/31/sweet-or-sour/&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; how here on Pentecost Sunday the children come and sings (boys and girls separately) in exhange for candy or money. They start when the kids are in school, so Christopher has to wait a couple of years yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These traditions for Pentecost seem to be dying out, since none of the other towns in our area do anything at all. (Grandparents might prefer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/papascott/14505342/&quot;&gt;this picture&lt;/a&gt; which shows less tree and more Christopher.)&lt;/p&gt;

It's more of a middle-class, middle-aged conformist. You could also say suburban, except Germany doesn't have suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal definition is &quot;that what we once ridiculed, but what we have now become&quot;, which I usually think of when I'm mowing the lawn, even though I'm allergic to grass clippings and don't really care how the lawn looks.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nazi Spam</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/05/15/nazi-spam</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a frustrating week, I was going to completely ignore work this weekend, but today's return of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atsnn.com/story/58333.html&quot;&gt;zombie Nazi spambots&lt;/a&gt; demanded attention. Many Germans are understandably disturbed by neo-Nazi mails sent by the latest variant of the Sober virus. Users who don't bat an eye at porn, drug or gambling spam are bothered by these mails, which apparently are related to the election in Nordrhein-Westfalen next Sunday (the wave of Nazi spam last summer was a week before the European Parliament elections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our domains is apparently misconfiured, so mails to non-existent addresses is sent to postmaster (i.e. me) instead of being bounced. So I quickly acquired several hundred examples of the latest Nazi spam in my inbox. After finding 26 &quot;Subject:&quot; lines on my own, I found the same ones in a list of &lt;a title=&quot;http://mailscanner.prolocation.net/german.cf&quot; href=&quot;http://mailscanner.prolocation.net/german.cf&quot;&gt;spamassassin rules for Nazi spam&lt;/a&gt;, plus 4 subjects in English that I hadn't seen. If you have postfix, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heise.de/newsticker/foren/go.shtml?read=1&amp;amp;msg_id=7992046&amp;amp;forum_id=78695&quot;&gt;filter Nazi spam with header_checks&lt;/a&gt;, which is even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't intend to celebrate my mother-in-law's 75th birthday on Mother's Days and the anniversary of VE Day. It just happened that way. As a surprise for her, we scanned in some of her old pictures and made a presentation. This picture is my favorite, and seems appropriate for all 3 occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is her confirmation picture at age 14, spring 1944. A year later her way of life would be destroyed: the war would be lost, her family would lose their house and mill (east of Frankfurt-Oder) and be expelled, and she would leave her family and flee alone to an uncle in bombed-out Hamburg rather than remain as a teenage girl among Russian occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture shows the strength and determination that got her through and enabled her to start her life anew after losing everything. I've never heard her talk with remorse or regret about all that she and her family lost with the war. Her old life was gone, and wishing it would come back would not make the present day any better. Was the end of the war a defeat or a liberation? I think she would say it was both, but more importantly it was a new beginning. She raised a very impressive family, a family which I'm very proud and happy to have married into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today she mentioned that the picture was in fact taken in Poland. All nearby German photographers had been called into the military, so her class travelled as a group across to border to a Polish photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/05/06/locked-in</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Holiday weekends like Ascension are great for sysadmins. We can try out system changes without bothering anyone's work, and if something breaks we have a couple of days to get things going again. So I took the opportunity yesterday to update a system, and of course it didn't come back up. We don't have any serial consoles set up yet, so I drove in to see what had gone wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our provider is located in an industrial part of Hamburg. They have a parking lot in back, but it's locked up outside of office hours. So I parked on the street, poked the system to get it back up, and went out the back door to drive back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the door locked behind me, I realized that it was the wrong door. I was locked in the parking lot, a very well walled and gated parking lot. There was no way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were short stretches where there was no wall, but a 3.5 m grated metal fence, with grates at the top slanted to the outside to discourage climbing. One stretch along the back was along a canal (fact: Hamburg has more canals than either Venice or Amsterdam), so I would have landed in the water. The other stretch was along the neighboring lot, with a potential landing on concrete. Not being particularly athletic, I wasn't sure whether I would be able to control my landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before risking my bones and ankles, I decided to make one more round and check all the doors leading out. Luckily, I found an unlocked door to another lobby, and was able to escape to freedom without breaking bones or setting off alarms. But 20 minutes of being locked in a parking lot was enough excitement for one day, and was a career risk of being a sysadmin that I had never before considered.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mixing Tiger and m0n0wall</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/05/06/mixing-tiger-and-m0n0wall/"/>
   <updated>2005-05-06T06:20:01+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/05/06/mixing-tiger-and-m0n0wall</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't really depend on my Powerbook for work, since I can get a browser and an ssh window in just about any operating system, so I was adventurous and installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt; when it arrived last weekend. Quick review: everything seems faster, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/&quot;&gt;Spotlight&lt;/a&gt; is weird, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; is lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I've run into an obscure and annoying bug. At work we run &lt;a href=&quot;http://m0n0.ch/wall/&quot;&gt;m0n0wall&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny firewall based on FreeBSD (and which I can heartily recommend). The only access is via a web front-end (mini\_httpd with php).  I found that accessing the m0n0wall with Firefox under Tiger causes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.firewalls.m0n0wall/16455&quot; title=&quot;gmane.comp.security.firewalls.m0n0wall&quot;&gt;mini\_httpd in m0n0wall to crash&lt;/a&gt;. The firewall is still running, you just can't view or change settings. It took me 3 or 4 crashes to associate them with Tiger, but then I was able to reproduce the behavior, and it was confirmed by another member of the mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mini\_httpd might be sensitive; there was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.firewalls.m0n0wall/7298&quot;&gt;previous bug reported&lt;/a&gt; involving crashes on m0n0wall. And Tiger seems to have some &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/networks/0,39020345,39197135,00.htm&quot; title=&quot;Networking firms lash out at Tiger - ZDNet UK News&quot;&gt;networking issues&lt;/a&gt;. But for now you'll want to avoid accessing m0n0wall with Firefox under Tiger, and if you administer a remote m0n0wall you might want to consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xs4all.nl/~fredmol/m0n0/&quot;&gt;the modified m0n0wall image with ssh&lt;/a&gt; so you can restart mini_httpd without physically rebooting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is Ascension, which in Germany is Father's Day &lt;em&gt;(Vatertag)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oeskovic.com/?p=476&quot; title=&quot;Daily Dose of Dave - And on Thurs-day he ascended into heaven&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; has some observations on the German tradition of over-indulging on the day devoted to German fathers. Yes, they really do go for walks pulling wooden wagons filled with alcoholic beverages. By the afternoon they usually look pretty beat up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did see one group pulling a wagon this afternoon that looked very fit, even at 5 pm. They were all women. An &lt;em&gt;Antifa&lt;/em&gt; demonstration perhaps (as in anti-father instead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa&quot;&gt;anti-fascist&lt;/a&gt;)? &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bargaining with the Tooth Fairy</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have the feeling Christopher is going to be a union negotiator when he grows up. He always tries to get as much as he can, and then just a little bit more. Can I habe a cookie? Two cookies? Five? Every time you draw a line in the sand, he tries to step over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's now trying the same tactic with the tooth fairy. Yes, we tried to tell him that there is no tooth fairy in Germany, but one of his friends told him about it. So last night he took his tooth box to bed in hopes of getting a present from the tooth fairy. Alas, neither of the fairy's assistants noticed, so he woke up very disappointed. So tonight the assistants are ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, Christopher wants to have his tooth and eat it too, so to speak. He doesn't want the tooth fairy to take his tooth... he just wants the money! We tried to explain that's not how the tooth fairy usually works, but he insisted... so we said that maybe if we leave a note for the tooth fairy to not take the tooth away, he might be able to keep it and still get a present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing Christopher, the tooth fairy had better insist on a receipt, otherwise he'll probably keep trying to cash in using the same tooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you think of Dave's tone, I've found him to be right more often than not.

&lt;p&gt;Christopher lost his first tooth this morning. He was a bit frightened at first, but some ice cream took care of that. In Germany, by the way,  you save your baby teeth in a little box &lt;em&gt;(Zahndose)&lt;/em&gt; instead of selling them to the tooth fairy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/04/30/multilateral-lasagne</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few years ago a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buitoni.com/&quot;&gt;certain brand&lt;/a&gt; of lasagne noodles had a package in 12 languages, including the recipe for (wouldn't you know it) lasagne. The French recipe was very general; there were no measurements, just make a batch of &lt;a href=&quot;http://frenchfood.about.com/od/frenchcuisinebasics/a/bechamel.htm&quot;&gt;Bechamel&lt;/a&gt; sauce, then a batch of red meat sauce, etc. The German version was somewhat longer and gave exact instructions: 750 ml milk, 50 g flour, 50 g butter for the Bechamel, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The English instructions were more to the point: take one can of Bechamel sauce, one can of meat sauce...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the German version became our favorite lasagne recipe, but they've stopped putting it on the package. We (or at least I) keep forgetting the proportions for the Bechamel sauce. Tonight we got it right, so I'm posting this to make sure we can always &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=bechamel+site%3Apapascott.de&quot;&gt;find it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd have a good one too, from a few years ago, but I didn't know it was lost. A couple days after returning from a trip to the States, I couldn't locate my passport. It couldn't be that far away, I obviously had it in my hand when I entered the country. I assumed I had misplaced it when unpacking, and that it would eventually show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of weeks, it hadn't shown up, and I submitted an application for a replacement to the consulate. They called me to say that they had my old passport, so I wouldn't need a new one. Someone had found it at the airport parking lot and had put in a mailbox, and the post sent it to the consulate. Which goes to show that sometimes when something is missing, maybe you really have lost it.&lt;/p&gt;

You'd rather not have to find the previous snapshot, convert the subsequent bin logs to SQL, edit a 200 MB file to delete the bad SQL statements, pipe those commands to the mysql client to update the snapshot, re-edit the SQL every time it gets stuck on a temporary table, and hope that everything turns out OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chances are good that everything will turn out OK, but you really don't want to have to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When talking about childhood with Germans, one of the differences one discovers is that they all grew up reading Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck comic books, and we didn't. We Americans outgrew Mickey and Donald by the time we were 6, but the Germans... they kept reading, even into adulthood, and even now ask for the English word for &lt;em&gt;Entenhausen&lt;/em&gt;, the town where Donald and Co. live. (What, it has a name?) My wife still talks today about smuggling Mickey Mouse comics to her cousins in East Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, a big reason for the German fans was the German translator &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Fuchs&quot; title=&quot;Erika Fuchs - Wikipedia&quot;&gt;Erika Fuchs&lt;/a&gt;, who lent the mouse and the duck a literary tongue not found in the original and who helped invent a grammatical form named after her, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikativ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Erikativ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, using a verb to express an action in a comic, as in *sigh*, a precursor of emoticons used today in chat and SMS.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erika Fuchs died this week aged 98. I'm too old to start reading comic books, so I guess I'll never catch on. (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://beissholz.de/pivot/artikel-992.html&quot; title=&quot;Erika Fuchs gestorben :o(&quot;&gt;beissholz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2005/04/25.html#trauerInEntenhausenDieDeutscheStimmeDonaldsIstVerstummt&quot;&gt;swr&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stat.allofmp3.com/ratings/charts.shtml?action=AMERalbums&quot;&gt;top 10 albums in the US&lt;/a&gt;, only 4 appear in the German Top 50 at all (2 in the high 40s, just barely making it). So I guess German music really is making a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;

But since we've never been to Paris, it would be somehow unfair to go to Paris without my wife, wouldn't it? (Although the first vision I have of going to Paris with my wife is losing her like in &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0095174&quot;&gt;Frantic&lt;/a&gt;... would I go jumping on roofs like Harrison Ford to look for her?

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I suspect our first trip to Paris will not be a romantic second honeymoon, but rather a visit with Christopher to see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disneylandparis.com/&quot;&gt;mouse&lt;/a&gt; at Disneyland Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The files stored on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/01/18/linux-mini/&quot;&gt;NSLU2&lt;/a&gt; running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/Unslung/HomePage&quot;&gt;Unslung&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slimdevices.com/su_downloads.html&quot;&gt;SlimServer&lt;/a&gt; (open-source, in Perl) is probably too hefty to run on Unslung; I've got it on a FreeBSD box which mounts the NSLU2 via NFS. The SlimServer can stream to software players as well as the Squeezebox and can serve several devices simultaneously. It seems much easier than having iTunes libraries on each PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was made aware of the Squeezebox by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/12/USB-DAC&quot;&gt;a post by Tim Bray&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago. Unlike him, we're no audiophiles... our existing setup is a 15-year-old mini stereo, but we can move the Squeezebox to whatever system we may upgrade to. It's not cheap at $300 (plus postage and customs), but seems to be much more convenient than the stacks of CDs we have accumulated. My initial impression is very positive, and even Mama the Technophobe agrees that it might be a nice thing to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One warning... the Slim Devices order page said the unit would be shipped in 5 to 7 days. That must be a typo, they must mean hours instead of days. My order was shipped the same day, and arrived from California within 48 hours of my order.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Darth Benedict</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Living on the northern Protestant end of a country long divided by the 30 Years' War, the election of the Pope, even a German Pope, is news that seems very far away. They do put on a good show and tell a good story, but as an outsider the Catholic church (without meaning to insult my Catholic friends) seems be a schizophrenic death cult. On the other hand, I wasn't born Catholic, and if I were, I have no idea whether I would reject the church or accept and try to live with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the German TV coverage of the election of Pope Benedict XVI didn't enlighten me much (except that the previous &quot;German&quot; Pope Hadrian VI was really Dutch). Cardinal Ratzinger has been in Rome for over 20 years, so he's not really in touch with the German church or the German people. His pronouncements on abortion (as Germany was rewriting its abortion laws a few years ago) and homosexuality seem to come from a different planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that English-language commentators are mentioning his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1572667,00.html&quot;&gt;membership in the Hitler Youth&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think anyone who did not live as a teenager in a wartime dictatorship is in any position to judge whether that was right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

I've &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/04/11/explaining-the-unexplainable/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott: Explaining the Unexplainable&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt; that Bergen-Belsen is perhaps the eeriest place I've ever been. There are no original buildings from the camp. They were all burned, and there are no replicas. There is a small museum, and various memorials, but most of the grounds consist of heather-covered mounds. Dozens of mounds. Each is a mass grave representing thousands of dead.  The stillness is overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

But a side comment is interesting. &quot;Rivals continue to chuckle about the customer reaction when, initially, Wal-Mart offered services such as grocery bagging. It turned out that Germans didn't want strangers handling their groceries. And when clerks followed orders to smile at shoppers, male customers took it as a come-on.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ministryofpropaganda.co.uk/2005propaganda/20050404-inspiration.shtml&quot; title=&quot;Ministry of Propaganda - 04/Apr/2005: I Need Inspiration&quot;&gt;(via Ministry of Propaganda)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Practice for Freetime</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow Christopher's Kindergarten group will be staying there overnight. It's a warm-up for their trip at the end of April, what they call &lt;em&gt;Freizeit&lt;/em&gt;, or Freetime, when the group will spend a week at St. Peter Ording on the North Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, in 3 weeks Christopher will be away from home for 5 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We weren't sure what to think when we first heard the idea. Four- and five-year-olds, away from home for a week? Isn't that a bit young to be away from one's parents for so long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's exactly the point, to give the kids a sense a sense of accomplishment, to present this with a real problem, a difficult task, and all the tools they need solve it. These are all kids with real handicaps or problems of one sort or another, and self-confidence is a vital ingredient to help them deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, tomorrow is the warm-up. They go swimming in the afternoon, go out to eat in the evening (Christopher is ordering fish sticks), and return to their classroom to sleep. We parents are supposed to bring them breakfast the next morning (we are to bring sliced cheese), then bring the kids home since experience shows that they will be too excited (and too tired) for kindergarten that day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are we going to do without Christopher tomorrow evening?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hourly labour costs in the present wave of accession countries were, on average, one-seventh of the west German level in 2003... The incentive for migration then is huge, as is that for moving production in the opposite direction... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, such migration is economically useless: it reduces output in the country of origin and lowers it in the recipient. Only if countries have flexible labour markets can migration be beneficial. Israel, the US and today's UK come to mind. Germany is in the opposite category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now for the first time, Christopher brought the disease home along with the checklist. He's sick with stomach flu. Probably only a one-day affair, but I was supposed to meet the Telekom at our ISP this morning. Hopefully my colleague didn't mind too much the wake-up call to fill in for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, when you add an alias to a network interface and then &amp;lt;a title=&quot;Making a Virtual Alias show up with &quot;ifconfig&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://portal.suse.com/sdb/en/2005/02/dcon_alias_labels.html&quot;&amp;gt;all of your aliases disappear from ifconfig, you shouldn't panic and assume that you've destroyed your network configuration.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone who ever saw a Twins baseball game in Minnesota would recognize the voice of Bob Casey, the Twins PA announcer since before I was born, who turned a no smoking announcement into a work of art, and bellowed the name of every player, home or visitor, as if he were a superstar (even if he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/stories/462/5315530.html&quot;&gt;got some of the names wrong&lt;/a&gt;). He &lt;a title=&quot;Yahoo!

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The totals on the board are correct&quot; is what he said immediately after the final out, &lt;a title=&quot;Patrick Reusse: No joy in baseball now that Casey's gone&quot; href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/stories/508/5315506.html&quot;&gt;even when they weren't&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard to imagine what a Twins game will be like without him. &lt;a href=&quot;http://davespicks.com/archive/2005/03/28.html&quot;&gt;(Dave's Picks)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how well this is known outside Germany, but the number one beer sold in Germany is no longer a national premium brand like Warsteiner, Bitburger or Krombacher, but the discount brand &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oettinger-bier.de/&quot;&gt;Oettinger&lt;/a&gt;. Spiegel Online calls it &lt;a title=&quot;Brauereien: Ein Bier f&amp;uuml;r Hartz IV&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,348108,00.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ein Bier f&amp;uuml;r Hartz IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, after Schr&amp;ouml;der's social reform package, since Oettinger usually sells at half the price of national brands. They cut costs by not advertising, selling only in stores (no bars or restaurants), and distributing themselves instead of through wholesalers. Interestingly, it's not sold at discount chains like Aldi... the profit margin there is too low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sold on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.autopackage.org/&quot;&gt;Autopackage&lt;/a&gt; system, but I agree with their analysis of the problems with &lt;a href=&quot;http://bylands.dur.ac.uk/%7Emh/autopackage.org/faq.html#2_1&quot;&gt;kitchen-sink Linux distributions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bylands.dur.ac.uk/%7Emh/autopackage.org/faq.html#4_1&quot;&gt;extreme software modularity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
One issue that is not mentioned is that Autopackage encourages&lt;br /&gt;
installation of untested configurations; this is not too surprising&lt;br /&gt;
given that everybody else does, too, and the open source world has&lt;br /&gt;
largely abandoned testing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I glanced at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.n24.de/&quot;&gt;N24&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon, and they were scrolling headlines from Kyrgyzstan while showing pictures of Peter Harry Carstensen. My first thought was that mobs had stormed the &lt;em&gt;Landtag&lt;/em&gt; in Kiel and had forced the the CDU leader into exile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given everything that's happened in Schleswig-Holstein the past few weeks, the thought isn't really that far fetched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem for me, of course, is that the technology has advanced 4-5 years since I swore it off. That's a lot of time on the web.... &quot;I'm pretty smart, but this shit is hard.&quot;... I think a lot of people who've been doing &quot;web stuff&quot; long enough think that web developers are the same as the &quot;HTML monkeys&quot; we use to refer to back in the day. That couldn't be farther from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True. That's why I switched from web development to systems administration. Cross-system &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/a&gt; compatibility is a lot easier to deal with than cross-system browser (in)compatibility. (Not to mention that I have no design sense at all.) I'll let the experts like &lt;a href=&quot;http://couchblog.de/webpropaganda/&quot;&gt;couch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ichbinharmlos.de/blog/&quot;&gt;fab1An&lt;/a&gt; make the sites look good. I'll stick to keeping them running.&lt;/p&gt;

That policy, considering the ease with which drugs and terrorists can enter the country from Mexico, is a big sham. And as Nicole points out, people are indignant enough to not travel or work in the US at allow. That's tourist money, business, talent and knowledge that is permanently lost to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, according to the Times, 80 migrants per year are found dead on the US side of the fence at the Mexican border. Less than 200 Germans were killed during &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_wall#The_years_of_the_Wall&quot;&gt;the entire history of the Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Germany politics, it almost seems that nothing happens without first being approved in advanced by a party committee, and it's almost a relief when something spontaneous and unexpected occurs. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/02/21/schleswigholstein-counts-the-votes/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott: Schleswig-Holstein Counts the Votes&quot;&gt;minority Red-Green government in Schleswig-Holstein&lt;/a&gt; was signed, sealed, but in the end not delivered. One member of the supposed coalition abstained in four secret ballots, und thus &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=26&amp;amp;story_id=18197&quot; title=&quot;Expatica - Schleswig-Holstein premier&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
quits after Kiel vote debacle&quot;&gt;Premier Heidi Simonis fell one vote short&lt;/a&gt;  of forming a government and subsequently resigned after nearly 12 years in office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schleswig-Holstein is a small fish in national politics, but symbolically this is a huge blow for Chancellor Schr&amp;ouml;der and the SPD. If you can't get your own back-benchers to support a long-standing state premier, how can you be expected to run the largest country in the EU? And how can you expect to keep ruling Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany's largest and last remaining Red-Green state which holds elections in May (the polls are neck and neck).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simonis, Germany's first and only female premier, always spoke her mind and I'll miss her for that (and her hats). Maybe Schr&amp;ouml;der will find a place for her in his Home for Wayward SPD Premiers (er, I mean his cabinet).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about going to CeBIT yesterday &lt;a title=&quot;Meet &amp;amp; Greet auf der CeBIT [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot; href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1410&quot;&gt;to meet Nico and Heiko&lt;/a&gt;, but I didn't have a babysitter (or a suit), and besides, I can meet Nico and Heiko in Hamburg anytime I want (at least when I have a babysitter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing, since on the train back to Hamburg Nico had a &lt;a title=&quot;Ende einer Dienstfahrt [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot; href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1412&quot;&gt;small disagreement&lt;/a&gt; with the conductor about his ticket, refused to pay full price, and ended up being handed over to federal agents at the next station. There were &lt;a title=&quot;C. Panzer und W. Laux by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/002929.shtml&quot;&gt;witnesses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories are in German, but the short moral is that if you upgrade your BahnCard, the Deutsche Bahn may consider tickets booked with your old BahnCard to be invalid. Or not. You might be better off driving. Or flying.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>First Level Support</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/03/09/first-level-support/"/>
   <updated>2005-03-09T22:11:41+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/03/09/first-level-support</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the, er, joys of my new job is administering a spanking new &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1361&quot; title=&quot;Citrix [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot;&gt;Citrix server&lt;/a&gt; on Windows Server 2003, as well as the accounts of those who use it. This is a new experience for me, since before I was strictly a network admin, which meant 1) no Windows and 2) no users. In the jargon of the trade, I performed second, not first, level support. Now at nu2m I am first, second, last, and all levels of support in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was with some trepidition that I approached my leading problem this morning, namely that the Citrix users in Cologne weren't able to find their local printers. I tried to approach the problem technically, logging in on a test account, but alas I was able to print find my local printer, so I couldn't reproduce the problem. I checked the account permissions, and they were all set up to automatically use local printers. Checking the printer directory, a printer was in fact set up for one of the users but not the other (who had been logged in for over a week). After over an hour I still couldn't tell what was wrong with them that wasn't wrong with me, so I had them give me a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was not technical at all. I talked the first user through trying out Wordpad, and the problem was just that the sever had selected the PDF Writer as her default printer, and she wasn't aware that her real printer was there waiting to be selected. For the other user, the printer appeared after she logged out and logged back on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I could have read FAQs and Googled and tested all day long... there was no way I could have solved the problem by myself until I actually talked to the users myself. It doesn't matter that the solution was hand-holding over the phone instead of a clever admin trick. The problem was solved, the users could now do their work. And that's what my job is, enabling people to work &lt;strike&gt;(so I don't have to)&lt;/strike&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don't worry about &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1361&quot; title=&quot;Citrix [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot;&gt;Nico's sreeenshot&lt;/a&gt;, I've set our firewall so that he can't do any more blogging or surfing under Citrix.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher's Story: On our way back from my first day of ski school, I stopped for a few moments to play in a hill of snow. When I looked up, Mama and Papa were gone! They must have gone back to the cabin without me! I knew that our cabin was just up the hill, so that's where I went, but I couldn't find Mama or Papa's footprints in the snow. Then I couldn't remember which of the cabins was ours... and I started to cry. Then a nice man came out of one of the houses to help me. He called his neighbor to ask if she knew a little boy, and then he took me to her house. There in the street was my Papa! I ran to him, and he thanked the nice man many times. We then called Mama, and when she came we all promised that next time we lost each other, we would go back to where we had last seen one another and wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papa's Story: On our way back from Christopher's first day of ski school, we went inside to check his registration. When I went back outside to check on Christopher, he was gone. He had been playing on a pile of snow in the hotel parking lot.  Within a few steps was the hotel, a restaurant, a construction site, and the ski hill. He was nowhere to be found. We put out an announcement in the restaurant (&quot;Christopher, your parents are looking for you, please come to the cashier!&quot;) and in the hotel. 30 minutes had passed, and we were starting to panic. Our cabin was just a 5 minute walk... maybe Christopher had gone home. We decided that I would go to the cabin while Mama waited in the parking lot where we had last seen him. As I got to the door, the lady next door asked if I was looking for a little boy. Her neighbor had called saying he had found him, and they were coming right over. At that moment a man with Christopher turned into our street. Everything was alright! I thanked the man many times, then ran with Christopher inside to call Mama with the news. When she came we all promised that next time we lost each other, we would go back to where we had last seen one another and wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has now become Christopher's favorite bedtime story, even more popular than the &quot;day Christopher was born&quot; story.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2005/02/21/five-questions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/2005/02/20&quot; title=&quot;Andrea's Weblog: Sunday, February 20, 2005&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; passed the Five Questions meme on to me. Good thing I've been paying attention, I had my answers ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Total amount of music files on your computer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;moneyball:~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music shanson$ du -sh&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
6.5G&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The last CD you bought was:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Depends on what you mean by CD...&lt;br /&gt;
The last physical CD I bought was Christmas music for Christopher: &quot;Weihnachten im Kindergarten&quot; by Rolf Zuckowski. The last album I bought at iTunes Music Store was &quot;Gold Medal&quot; by The Donnas last November. The last album I bought at allofmp3.com was &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; by The Bangles last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What is the song you last listened to before reading this message?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;My Love Will Not Let You Down&quot; by Bruce Springsteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Write down 5 songs you often listen to or that mean a lot to you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;The River&quot; by Bruce Springsteen&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Best Friend's Girl&quot; by The Cars&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;When U Were Mine&quot; by Prince&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Mach Die Augen Zu&quot; by Die &amp;Auml;rzte&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Nur Getr&amp;auml;umt&quot; by Nena  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all &quot;I've lost my love and now I've lost my mind&quot; songs, except for Nena. And &quot;Downbound Train&quot; would a more fitting Springsteen song, but I like &quot;The River&quot; better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Who are you going to pass this stick to? (3 persons) and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don't know yet... most everyone I read has already done this.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That's what I get for going to bed early. The official count came out at midnight, and the CDU-FDP have fallen short of a majority by 70 votes. Of the 69 seats in the state parliament, they have 34 to 33 for SPD-Green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2 remaining seats belong the SSW, the Danish minority party exempt from the 5% clause. They won't join a coalition, but would tolerate a minority government. The SSW supports a Scandinavian model for economic and education policies, and are more likely to support a SPD government.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife's home state Schleswig-Holstein held elections today, and it looks like &lt;a title=&quot;BBC NEWS | Europe | German poll setback for Schroeder&quot; href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4281751.stm&quot;&gt;Red-Green has been defeated&lt;/a&gt;. The polls showed the SPD 3% ahead of the CDU, but the latest count shows the CDU 2% ahead. Was there really a 5% swing at the last minute, or were the polls wishful thinking from the media?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting that education was a major issue in the campaign, with the CDU for the traditional 3-tiered secondary school system, and the SPD for a unified system more like that in the US. Apparently the German voters are more comfortable with the old system, and I doubt that a change in school system will be a campaign issue this year or next.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Funny, ever since I went to work for a blogging company, I don't really have time to pay attention to my own blog. But I did some tweaking today. I put in new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twin-music.com/azlyrics/g_file/songs/gogo/head.html&quot;&gt;song lyrics&lt;/a&gt; in the header, and put back the  &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Heros without Glory&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/18/heros-without-glory/&quot;&gt;photo of the DDR uprising girl&lt;/a&gt;. And I adjusted the blogroll to show only a random category instead of the whole thing, plus the expat weblogs (since that's probably the most unique group I belong to). Randomizing the blogroll will probably mess with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com/&quot;&gt;Technorati's&lt;/a&gt; mind when counting my outgoing links, though. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now Christopher totally enthralled by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3831500053&quot;&gt;Lauras Stern&lt;/a&gt; series of books (available in English as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/188844424X&quot;&gt;Laura's Star&lt;/a&gt;), in which Laura finds and mends a fallen star.

quite willing to embellish which ever brand of bias we prescribe too... It¬ís too much fun to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/span&gt; George Bush, and it remains to be too much of a blog traffic &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;magnet&lt;/span&gt; to just give up. The same holds true with bashing Hillary. It is, therefore, no surprise that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;dis&lt;/span&gt;information is the literature of choice in the 21st century, as it was in the 20th, and the 19th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good hint for mysql is to make sure that the mysql user has write privileges in its data directory. That's such a basic mistake that you don't even think it could go wrong, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;

We concieved Christopher just after I started, and my work at there was our sole support from his birth to his first birthday. I'm still grateful that. But today I'm happy to put the uncertainty behind me, sad to leave the few good friends and colleagues who remain, and frustrated that the circumstances made it impossible to make a clean break.  The bankruptcy administrator is telling us he has several serious takeover offers. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I can devote my full attention to Nico and my new colleagues at nu2m.de, who've all been very understanding that I couldn't jump completely on board right away. Thanks, I'm 100% here now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Assigning meaningful yet witty hostnames is an important task for every systems administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I recently took over a pair of webservers named &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Muntz&quot;&gt;nelson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhouse&quot;&gt;milhouse&lt;/a&gt;, I immediately thought of Watergate-era US politicians, since I knew my new boss had studied politics at Berkeley. Only later did I realize that it was actually Matt Groening who was thinking of politicans when he was naming characters for The Simpsons. (The companion servers itchy and scratchy should have been a dead giveaway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad, since the firewalls protecting nelson and milhouse would have been perfectly named &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_Seven&quot;&gt;haldeman and erlichman&lt;/a&gt;. haldeman in front, he's the heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about my previous employer going bankrupt is that for January we will get paid on time for the first time in months. The government guarantees three months pay in event of insolvency, so it is routine for the court-appointed administrator to get a bank credit for paying salaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The not-so-funny thing is that the bankruptcy process has delayed my departure, as releases from employment contracts need to be approved by the administrator, and he wasn't signing any releases at first. He's now releasing people not going to the competition, so I should be clear now. My boss and I have agreed on a release date of mid February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news for my co-workers is that the administrator is confident that a serious buyer will be found, one interested in keeping the present customers, projects and developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, at my new job &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=1220&quot;&gt;Nico has my new office ready&lt;/a&gt; :-).&lt;/p&gt;

It's not just that she doesn't think she is an appropriate spokesperson for her business or that she seems to be &quot;just as blond as she looks&quot;. It's mostly because her male colleagues can't think straight anymore because their tongues are hanging out at the prospect of meeting a real, live supermodel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you care to meet Heidi Klum, she'll be doing promotion at the&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also funny that the referee Hoyzer hat a thing about Hamburg; 3 of the 5 supposedly fixed matches went against either HSV or FC St. Pauli. I'm kind of waiting for the revelation that in the cup match against Paderborn, Hoyzer had actually bet on HSV, but they still lost.&lt;/p&gt;

The newspaper is, and I want to be kind here, absolute and utter crap.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except of course that The Sun puts its girls on Page 3, while Bild puts them on the front page under the fold. Bild has a deal with McDonald's where you can buy the newspaper in the restaurant, with the latest edition displayed at the entrance. As customers leave the restaurant, they see the back of the paper, and are thus treated to an upside-down Bild-Girl behind glass.&lt;/p&gt;

Not that's going to prevent much of anything. If comment spam is anything like email spam, we're going to see four waves, each exponentially bigger than the one before: the originators, the copy-cats, the script-kiddies and then the robots. Only the first wave is smart. The rest will never notice that comment spam is no longer doing them any good, and won't bother to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what actual good does being indexed by Google do me anyway, other than sending me copy-cats, script-kiddies and robots to click on my Google ads?&lt;/p&gt;

Then again, didn't these Americans wonder what the toilet-bowl shaped brush next to the toilet was for? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for Sitzpinkeln itself, if you're man enough to stand up, you're man enough to clean up... otherwise you should remain seated. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've made it through the holidays. The American visitors are now home, the birthday boy is now 5, the goose leftovers are gone, and the last fireworks were fired last night. We just need a few days now to rest up, and we're ready to start work again. Except we don't have a few days. We both go back to work tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/21/new-media-management/&quot;&gt;new job at nu2m&lt;/a&gt; starts on February 1, except I've started a few projects already. One advantage is that I can work from home, mostly because Nico is short on office space. I'm at the old job this month yet, wrapping things up.&lt;/p&gt;

When we turned it on this morning, the display showed mostly black and the images are abstract  blobs of light. So to the repair shop it will go. If the guarantee doesn't cover it, it won't pay to fix it, since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001IR9M8&quot; title=&quot;Canon PowerShot A75&quot;&gt;the current model&lt;/a&gt; costs just half what we paid for the A70.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I try not to post about world events unless I have something unique to say. Indeed there is nothing one can say, words cannot describe the devestation caused by today's &lt;a title=&quot;Loic Le Meur Blog: Earthquake and tidal waves kill more than 3000 people in SE Asia&quot; href=&quot;http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/12/earthquake_and_.html&quot;&gt;tidal wave in Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;, killing thousands. The earthquake that caused the tsunami is described as the largest (8.9 magnitude) in more than 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next largest earthquake, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drgeorgepc.com/Earthquake1964Alaska.html&quot;&gt;1964 in Alaska&lt;/a&gt; (9.2 magnitude), caused 131 deaths and is a part of my family history. The resulting tidal wave caused death and destruction &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drgeorgepc.com/Tsunami1964Calif.html&quot;&gt;as far south as California&lt;/a&gt;. Hardest hit in California was Crescent City (11 dead). My father worked in Crescent City at the time for the state Department of Highways, surveying US Highway 101. He remembers that it was a series of 4 waves, and it was the last of them that devastated the town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we heard of todays quake, my father said that there must have been some kind of warning... even in 1964 they knew hours in advance of the approaching wave. Then we saw the report on SPON that &lt;a title=&quot;Experten-Kritik: Warnsystem h√§tte viele Opfer vermeiden k√∂nnen - Panorama - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,334503,00.html&quot;&gt;there is no tsunami warning system in southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;. And it was clear that the tens of thousands who died today had no warning at all. &lt;a title=&quot;Instapundit.com - WHY THE TSUNAMI DEATH TOLL IS SO HIGH&quot; href=&quot;http://instapundit.com/archives/020070.php&quot;&gt;Indeed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We can understand the anticipation on the day when Santa arrives (at our house, he arrives while we are at church and leaves his package on Christopher's sled on the patio) and the presents will be opened. We can sleep late the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. This morning Christopher was up at 5:30 to play with his new toys. The first thing he did was kiss each one, so I guess he likes them. The highlight is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://store.playmobilusa.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/PM_DisplayProductInformation-Start;sid=fczBM3YGcUPBIjfLe63NFbg0OnNIO01W6-U=?ProductSKU=3185&amp;amp;CategoryName=US_storefront&amp;amp;PLS=0#&quot;&gt;Playmobil Airplane&lt;/a&gt;, which even the adults think is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Interesting Times</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/22/interesting-times/"/>
   <updated>2004-12-22T07:53:17+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/22/interesting-times</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote before about how life was handing us a &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Truly, Deeply, Madly&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/09/truly-deeply-madly/&quot;&gt;new twist of fate&lt;/a&gt;. I can now explain all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I had decided to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/15/half-time/&quot;&gt;stick it out&lt;/a&gt; at my old company. I reduced to 20 hours to give myself a little free time, but we remaining 3 admins had settled into a routine, and we had a new boss who respected us and our work, even if he didn't understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then colleague number 1 told us she was pregnant. She would be going on leave next May, probably for the full 3 years allowed by law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colleague number 2 then told us that he had a job offer from our former boss. He has to give 6 months notice, but would try to negotiate a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on November 30 our new boss told us that he, and several other project leaders, had resigned. They no longer believed in the future of the company. This was all the more troubling because they, like me, have quarterly contracts, so they were giving 4 months notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two weeks after signing my part-time contract, it was starting to look like a set of shackles. Downsizing the IT infrastructure of a company that was suddenly half the size of 6 months ago is certainly an interesting task, but interesting in the sense of the Chinese curse &quot;May you live in interesting times&quot;. It's certainly a task I did not want to do by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on the evening of the 30th, while I was contemplating the interesting times that lay ahead, Nico called me to say he had an admin position available, and whether I would be interested. We met on the following D√∂nerstag (er, Thursday), our discussion was very good, and that's when I wrote about twists of fate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Life and Hard Times</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/15/my-life-and-hard-times/"/>
   <updated>2004-12-15T05:11:58+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/15/my-life-and-hard-times</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;December seems like a drag stip that ends in a brick wall, and we're speeding along in a hot rod without any brakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Christopher, there is the anticipation of the double super-duper holiday of Christmas and birthday, and of course he is strung as high as a kite. Perspective parents should think of this, and would be best advised to avoid having any sex in late March at all to prevent giving birth to children in late December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama is suffering from overdoses of work, travel, stess, and combinations thereof. When she is home, she tends to go to bed before Christopher, even when she is putting Christopher to bed. This is especially annoying when she disappears to bed without telling us. (My solution was to send Christopher to bed with her, and for me to sleep on the couch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents are arriving on Friday, which is special and wonderful, of course, since it will be their first Christmas with us in Germany. But there are preparations to be made... for example, my father requires an oxygen concentrator at night, and I spent weeks unsuccessfully trying to arrange for one. (The solution, by the way, to organizing medical equipment for foreign guests is that you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt;... the arrangements need to be made in their home country for insurance and prescription reasons.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, after I had decided to stick it out part-time at work until things either work out or go bankrupt, I had a job opportunity literally fall into my lap, and I've decided to accept. I haven't signed anything yet (although we did virtually shake hands via instant messenger), so I won't give out any details now. But I've informed my present employer, and if I can find victims, er, delegate my responsibilites I should be able to start the new job on February 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But given everything else going on here at home, my excitement about the new job has gotten somewhat lost in the shuffle. (And, yes, the job offer was the twist of fate that inspired the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/09/truly-deeply-madly/&quot;&gt;Truly, Deeply, Madly&lt;/a&gt; post, for those commenters who tried to guess.)&lt;/p&gt;

We don't have an FCC in Germany, but we do have the &lt;em&gt;Bild Zeitung&lt;/em&gt; to watch over morals in the media and society... and we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bildblog.de/&quot;&gt;BildBlog&lt;/a&gt; to watch over the &lt;em&gt;Bild Zeiting&lt;/em&gt;.

   <title>MDAC Insanity</title>

   <updated>2004-12-12T19:00:44+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/12/mdac-insanity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do people get serious work done with Windows? I have no idea...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife wanted to update the route planning software (i.e. how many km from A to B, so she can fill out her mileage log) on her Windows XP notebook. Her company sells an atlas with software included, but she couldn't get the program to run. &quot;Not enough licenses, try again later.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart husband decides to save time and spend ¬Ä20 to get her a &lt;a title=&quot;G DATA Software: PowerRoute 2004&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gdata.de/trade/productview/388/4/&quot;&gt;real routing program&lt;/a&gt;. Mistake. It's the same program with a different name. &quot;Not enough licenses, try again later.&quot; The problem is mentioned in the Install FAQ: Make sure you are running as Administrator. Of course I was already running as Administrator, so that's no help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this had been my notebook, at this point I would have installed Service Pack 2 and made sure everything was up to date. However, it's not my notebook, it's only got SP1, and the last thing I want to do is break anything; access to her company WAN is essential to her work. The setup program seems unable to detect that  &lt;abbr title=&quot;Microsoft Data Access Components&quot;&gt;MDAC&lt;/abbr&gt; (included with Windows) is installed, so I make sure I have the latest version and patches, and for the Jet Database Engine as well. The updates install successfully, but no luck. &quot;Not enough licenses, try again later.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after a couple hours of Googling, I find a &lt;a title=&quot;Frequently asked questions about MDAC 2.6 Setup&quot; href=&quot;http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=842193&quot;&gt;FAQ at Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; that covers rolling back MDAC to the original version installed with Windows (&quot;dasetup.exe /u&quot;). Never mind that it doesn't cover XP or the version of MDAC that we have. I'm desperate, and I try it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works. Both setup programs no longer complain that MDAC is missing, and both programs are now installed and run flawlessly. I'm an experienced Sys Admin, and it only took me 6 hours to track down and correct a corrupted MDAC installation. I have no idea a normal Windows user is supposed fix something like this. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/&quot;&gt;Scoble&lt;/a&gt; can tell me. I know he follows linkbacks.... &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/&quot;&gt;Scoble?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gegen Die Wand&quot; (&quot;Head-On&quot;), about a young Turkish woman in Germany who escapes her strict Muslim home through a difficult marriage with an older man, won the best film award in the competition dubbed the &quot;European Oscars&quot; on Saturday... The European Film Awards sealed the remarkable success of &quot;Gegen Die Wand&quot;, which overcame a scandal over its star's porn movie past to score a German box-office success and win major prizes including the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. As well as best film, Turkish-German Fatih Akin collected the best director award for &quot;Gegen Die Wand&quot; in the People's Choice category on Saturday.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akin lives and works in Hamburg-Altona, and much of the film was shot there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since we first met, we have been very successful making sudden, impulsive decisions and letting fate take us where it may. Pledging to marry while on separate continents, dropping out of grad school, leaving Minneapolis without the promise of a job in Phoenix, leaving everything we owned to move to Germany, jumping head first into the IT boom in the late '90s, having our first child after 15 years of happy, peaceful marriage, jumping back into a career after a year of baby leave... these were all things we decided very quickly and suddenly to make happen or let happen to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're on the verge of another such impulsive decision or twist of fate. If you've read the weblog for  long, you might guess what it is.... more details once things are final. However, right now I'm just ecstatic to find that at my age, impulsive decisions can still happen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;The End: Hamburg 1943 by Hans Erich Nossack&quot; href=&quot;http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/16499.ctl&quot;&gt;The End: Hamburg 1943 by Hans Erich Nossack&lt;/a&gt; just published in English translation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One didn¬ít dare to inhale for fear of breathing it in. It was the sound&lt;br /&gt;
of eighteen hundred airplanes approaching Hamburg from the south at an&lt;br /&gt;
unimaginable height. We had already experienced two hundred or even&lt;br /&gt;
more air raids, among them some very heavy ones, but this was something&lt;br /&gt;
completely new. And yet there was an immediate recognition: this was&lt;br /&gt;
what everyone had been waiting for, what had hung for months like a&lt;br /&gt;
shadow over everything we did, making us weary. It was the end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novelist Hans Erich Nossack was forty-two when the Allied bombardments of German cities began, and he watched the destruction of Hamburg--the city where he was born and where he would later die--from across its Elbe River. He heard the whistle of the bombs and the singing of shrapnel; he watched his neighbors flee; he wondered if his home--and his manuscripts--would survive the devastation. The End is his terse, remarkable memoir of the annihilation of the city, written only three months after the bombing. A searing firsthand account of one of the most notorious events of World War II, The End is also a meditation on war and hope, history and its devastation. And it is the rare book, as W. G. Sebald noted, that describes the Allied bombing campaign from the German perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original is entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3518015230&quot;&gt;Der Untergang&lt;/a&gt; published by Suhrkamp.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Blogroll Timestamps with Perl and Bloglines</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/07/blogroll-timestamps-with-perl-and-bloglines/"/>
   <updated>2004-12-07T14:50:10+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/12/07/blogroll-timestamps-with-perl-and-bloglines</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was retrieving my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/10/23/bloglines-timestamps/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott: Bloglines Timestamps&quot;&gt;blogroll with timestamps from Bloglines&lt;/a&gt; using their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/services/api/&quot;&gt;web services API&lt;/a&gt;, but that both my scripts and their API were still buggy. Both are now mostly fixed, I can now get timestamps for 99.5% of my blogroll with the API. The necessary files are at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/papascott/bloglines/&quot; title=&quot;SourceForge.net CVS Repository - directory - cvs: papascott/bloglines&quot;&gt;personal CVS repository&lt;/a&gt;: a database schema (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/papascott/bloglines/schema.sql?rev=1.1&amp;amp;view=markup&quot;&gt;schema.sql&lt;/a&gt;), three Perl scripts that read the blogroll into the database (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/papascott/bloglines/bl.getblogroll.pl?rev=1.1.1.1&amp;amp;view=markup&quot;&gt;bl.getblogroll.pl&lt;/a&gt;), read the timestamps into the database (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/papascott/bloglines/bl.read.pl?rev=1.2&amp;amp;view=auto&quot;&gt;bl.read.pl&lt;/a&gt;), and write an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/bl.rss&quot;&gt;RSS file&lt;/a&gt; from the database (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/papascott/bloglines/bl.write.pl?rev=1.1.1.1&amp;amp;view=auto&quot;&gt;bl.write.pl&lt;/a&gt;), and finally a PHP script using MagpieRSS that reads the RSS file (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/papascott/bloglines/blogroll-simple.php?rev=1.1&amp;amp;view=auto&quot;&gt;blogroll-simple.php&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scripts are not specific to any weblog software. The Perl scripts require the modules &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/WebService-Bloglines/&quot;&gt;WebService::Bloglines&lt;/a&gt;, XML::Parser and LWP, among others. I run the Perl scripts every 15 minutes with cron (saving the results of bl.write.pl to a file), and include() the PHP script on my home page. That's all the documentation I'm going to give for now, but if you can understand it, feel free to play with the scripts and send me your improvements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Well, maybe a few notes are in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The Bloglines API gets all feeds whether they are marked as public or not. I put my private feeds into separate folders which are ignored by the notifier. My script then only gets those feeds which are in folders that are not ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The database field link_alias will override the weblog title in the RSS output, if present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The WebService::Bloglines method getitems() will die if the HTTP status is not 200. However, it is perfectly valid for a feed to return a status of 304 (i.e. no newer entries are available). Therefore I check the status of each feed with LWP first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Similarly, getitems() will also die if the input is not valid XML. This is the 0.5% when the script does not work (namely, for Aaron Swartz... his RSS is valid, but Bloglines appears to have truncated a field for his feed). So a blog is simply skipped if the XML is not valid.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/29/citizenship-and-dual-nationality</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I'm often asked about Christopher's citizenship status, here is a primer on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usembassy.de/germany/dual_nationality.html&quot; title=&quot;Citizenship and Dual Nationality - United States Mission to Germany&quot;&gt;Citizenship and Dual Nationality&lt;/a&gt; from the US Embassy. For Christopher: &quot;A child born to an American parent and a German parent acquires both American and German citizenship at birth, regardless of place of birth, if the parents satisfy the jus soli or jus sanguinis requirements of their respective countries...  Neither country requires a person born under these circumstances to choose between American and German citizenship, i.e., he/she may keep both citizenships his/her entire life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for his parents: &quot;Under German law, a person may not have more than one citizenship unless he/she was born with both... Thus, German law requires an American who becomes a German citizen through the &lt;em&gt;Einb&amp;uuml;rgerung&lt;/em&gt; process to formally renounce his/her American citizenship, and a German who becomes an American citizen to give up his/her German citizenship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/27/stillstand</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher's kindergarten group went ice skating on Thursday, and he was so excited by it that he just had to take Mama and Papa ice skating in Adendorf today. Never mind that we haven't skated in 15 years. That's the advantage of being a spoiled only child, you can create your own events, just like that. Of course Christopher can't skate, or rather, skates only as well as you'd expect a 4-year-old to do for his second time on skates. But he loved watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zamboni.com/&quot;&gt;Zamboni&lt;/a&gt; machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the rest of the afternoon was ruined by being stuck behind an accident on the Autobahn on the way home. German police tend to not let any traffic go by an accident site, they'd rather shut the Autobahn down completely. So we came to a complete stop, and counted 15 emergency vehicles that passed by us. We stayed put for 2 hours, then we were told to turn around and drive back to the last exit. That took half an hour to work out, since Autobahns are not designed for driving the wrong way, and then we had to find an alternate route home. So now we are all three tired and pissed off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago we once stood still for 3 hours behind an accident, but that time they let us pass rather than making us turn around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, Santa has a sidekick, the &lt;em&gt;Nikolaus&lt;/em&gt;, who comes ahead of time and cases the joint for the big guy. As Mama was unpacking the Christmas decorations this evening, Christopher said the &lt;em&gt;Nikolaus&lt;/em&gt; needs a horse and quickly drew and cut out this. And I had another one of those moments when realized my son is both more intelligent &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more creative than I.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Looking through one of my new Bloglines feeds, I saw this about &lt;a title=&quot;North Sea Diaries - Slumming it&quot; href=&quot;http://www.north-sea.net/archives/208&quot;&gt;Spanish soccer fans taunting black English players&lt;/a&gt; with monkey noises. That reminds me of my first sports experience in Hamburg. In the fall of 1990, I ventured alone to the Volksparkstadion to watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hsv.de/&quot;&gt;HSV&lt;/a&gt; play Frankfurt, and was disgusted at how the Hamburg fans grunted like monkeys every time the black Frankfurt striker touched the ball. I've never seen HSV since, and still hold a mild distain for HSV and their fans. But I only rarely make fun of children whose parents make them wear HSV gear. Only rarely. But more often when HSV is doing poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is, that black striker was Anthony Yeboah, who later in his career played for... you guessed it, HSV.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/23/wild-wild-east</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed talking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livejournal.com/users/dolboeb/&quot; title=&quot;Anton Nossik's LiveJournal Notes&quot;&gt;Anton Nossik&lt;/a&gt; last night after the discussion. (The LiveJournal link is his personal blog, professionally he has several Russian news sites including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mosnews.com/&quot; title=&quot;MOSNEWS.COM&quot;&gt;mosnews.com&lt;/a&gt; in English.) It was interesting to hear his main first impression of Germany: the &quot;friendly&quot; roads and drivers. The autobahns are certainly well built, and built for speed, but are German drivers really friendly? But then I remembered the t.A.T.u. album title &quot;200 km/h in the Wrong Lane&quot;... if that's a description of Russian driving, then German drivers must seem very friendly indeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told him I came from Minnesota, he immediately thought of the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt;, and asked if Minnesotans really use wood chippers that way (if you've never seen the movie, don't ask...). He also got the impression that Minnesota is colder than Moscow. Somehow I doubt that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he refuted one of my misconceptions about journalists. I had just maintained on the train ride to Cologne to Heiko and Gerd that the difference between journalists and bloggers is that blogger are can choose *not* to write, that they do not have a quota of minutes or column inches to fill. But Anton told me of a certain business dispute in Russia where both sides were paying him *not* to report the details, a form of reverse PR. He had no problems with that, since he wasn't intending to report on it anyway, but he was still disappointed when the dispute was settled.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pirates of the Internet</title>

   <updated>2004-11-23T13:50:25+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/23/pirates-of-the-internet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since we didn't actually talk that much about press freedom at the discussion, I didn't get a chance to use the line I came up with. So I'll have to give it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we're talking about press freedom in a place where it can really make a difference, we're talking about a place that doesn't have it yet. And a government interested in controlling the press is going to be controlling the internet was well. The internet runs over wires and cables, and a poor country is not going to have that many cables coming in. And big IT companies like Sun, Cisco and IBM are going to be more than happy to sell the the equipment and know-how to control everything going in and out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's no problem if you're going to be sending secret messages, you just use encryption and let the spooks spin their wheels. But weblogs are public messages, and once a weblog becomes bothersome, it's easy enough for a government to shut them down, or block them if they are hosted abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, a group of internet entrepreneurs that creatively and successfully work around such filters. If webloggers want to deliver a message to a place where the powers that be do not want that message to be heard, they have to start thinking like those entrepreneurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, webloggers have to start thinking like spammers, pornographers and file traders. That's the way to route around censorship.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Early Morning Cologne</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/23/early-morning-cologne/"/>
   <updated>2004-11-23T06:06:51+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/23/early-morning-cologne</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came to Cologne grateful for the invitation from the Deutsche Welle, but skeptical about the event. A discussion forum about blogging, organized for and by the mainstream media, &lt;em&gt;Das kann nicht gut gehen&lt;/em&gt;, that could never work. However, it turned out that DW let the bloggers run the show, and so it was an excellent blogger meeting with some foreign guests. And an open bar. Sure, there were some DW types standing around with &quot;look at those crazy kids&quot; expressions, but they let us have our fun. There were maybe one or two journalists in attendance, so it was by and large a blogger event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What DW offers and what makes the BOBS awards more valuable that I had expected are its language resources. Bloggers talk a lot about creating international cross contacts, but we're not really sure how to overcome the language barrier. Delivering messages in several languages is something DW does every day. By bringing together a jury to evaluate weblogs in 7 languages, they let us overcome that language barrier, at least for a moment. They are able to bring Mu Zimei to us, even though she has never before left China and speaks only Chinese. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury's decision will only be annonced in two weeks, but I'm sure they have picked as Best Blog of the Moment some weblog from a far corner of the world that &quot;we&quot; have never heard of, in a language &quot;we&quot; cannot understand, and that tells a story that is for &quot;us&quot; completely new and exciting. And that's why I do this weblog thing, to keep hearing new stories.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Press Salon</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/22/press-salon/"/>
   <updated>2004-11-22T18:31:52+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/22/press-salon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The discussion begins. Konstantin is expanding the topic... that's good, since bloggers are not journalists, so weblogs don't have much to do with *press* freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of *expression* is something that means something in Germany and the United States, but perhaps something different in other countries. Therefore it is good that DW has brought two guests from China and Russia (links to follow) who perhaps have a different experience with freedom of expression than the type weblogger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The event is taking place in German, therefore I'll be simultaneously listening, blogging and translating, and that somewhat slowly, and not very well. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mu Zimei (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edifyingspectacle.org/sexuality/blog/archives/laws_and_politicians_mostly_bad/mu_zimei_reviled_admired.php&quot;&gt;lucky google link&lt;/a&gt;) describes her experience with webloggingas a comet, spontaneous, bright, but falling fast. Not planned, not political, and a controversy for both Chinese society and the Chinese government. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.schockwellenreiter.de/6753&quot;&gt;(The Schockwellenreiter is fascinated.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anton Nossik: The Russian internet has a different history, elitist and acedemic. It was never meant to be a mass medium. The authorities are not interested in supressing speech, but what is heard, what information is actually disseminated. Laws are banning press coverage of terrorist acts, or even violence in general... will audiences turn instead to the internet? They are not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;ouml;rg Kantel: In comparison, in Germany things are relatively good... except maybe in Nordrhein Westfalen, where a state government has a regulation on paper about links to neo-Nazi sites. Can a mere link be illegal? Otherwise, there have been copyright and trademark conflicts (Novitel). Impressungspflicht (identifcation of publisher), does it apply to webloggers (who do not have a business address for their blog)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question from Konstantin: Do the technological possibilities of the internet fundamentally change freedom of speech? If there are millions of bloggers instead of a handful of broadcasters and publishers? Is blogging OK only as long as it remains under the radar, as long as noone listens? J&amp;ouml;rg says no... the internet can be a mass medium and a personal medium, at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heiko Hebig: What is the best and the worst thing to happen as the result of your weblog? Maybe something we can all think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Hanson: Do spammers have freedom of expression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mu Zimei: Charity blogs: a way for blogs to make a real difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And at this point the live blogging ended. More posts on the evening are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/23/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;She doesn't know it yet, but we are about to drag my mother-in-law kicking and screaming into the 21st century. We are getting her a cell phone. She's 70 years old and drives alone, sometimes at night. She needs a mobile phone in case of emergency. We'll convince her of that. But she's techno-phobic. She doesn't even like using a remote control for her TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a several old phones, so hardware is not a problem. I have a Motorola Timeport I picked up for &amp;euro;3 from work. It seems to be the cell phone we have that looks the most like a normal phone. The menus are way too complicated, though. I wish I could disable everything except the phone book. All she needs to do is to make and receive calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/005129.html&quot; title=&quot;vowe dot net :: Do not use mobile roaming in Germany&quot;&gt;vowe's advice&lt;/a&gt;, I bought a prepaid SIM from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tchibo.de/&quot;&gt;Tchibo&lt;/a&gt; for &amp;euro;20, including &amp;euro;10 credit good for one year. All domestic calls cost 35 cents per minute anytime. That's simple enough to remember, and Tchibo coffee shops are all over to buy more credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll give her the phone for &lt;em&gt;Nikolaus&lt;/em&gt; on December 6. We'll have to think of a way to put it in her shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I usually ignore award contests for weblogs, because 1) I believe that weblogs are an expressive medium solely motivated by personal satisfaction, and 2) I wouldn't win anyway. But I make exceptions for award contests that invite me to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Monday I'll be in Cologne attending a &quot;press salon&quot; held by &lt;a title=&quot;The BOBs - BEST OF THE BLOGS - Deutsche Welle International Weblog Awards 2004&quot; href=&quot;http://www.thebobs.de/bob.php?site=home&quot;&gt;The Deutsche Welle International Weblog Awards&lt;/a&gt; featuring a discussion on &quot;Weblogs and Freedom of the Press&quot; by Mu Zimei (China), J√∂rg Kantel (Germany) and Anton Nossik (Russia), and moderated by Konstantin Klein (Very Large Orange, and ex-German-expat). The salon will be &quot;blogged live&quot;, which is where I come in. I imagine they will dress me in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/12/a-guy-in-his-pajamas/&quot;&gt;pajamas&lt;/a&gt; and put me on display for the journalists in a golden cage hung from the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't see any mention of the event at DW's website, so you'll have to take &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.schockwellenreiter.de/6707&quot;&gt;J√∂rg's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldwideklein.de/index.php?/weblog/on-the-road-again/&quot;&gt;Konstantin's&lt;/a&gt; word for it that it is indeed taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Oldest German Blog?</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/16/oldest-german-blog/"/>
   <updated>2004-11-16T21:41:20+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/16/oldest-german-blog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm just wondering, what's the oldest active German weblog? How many German blogs that were early adopters of first wave of blogging services like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; (Aug 1999), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diaryland.com/&quot;&gt;Diaryland&lt;/a&gt; (Sept 1999), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;EditThisPage&lt;/a&gt; (Dec 1999) are still active? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm familiar with the EditThisPage crowd... &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; started in January 2000 and is still going strong. I think her husband &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spicynoodles.net/&quot;&gt;Andr&amp;eacute;&lt;/a&gt; (who worked for Userland at the time) was using Manila before EditThisPage went public, but now he now posts only once every other year, so I'm not sure he can be called active. Are there any other German '99ers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, I had forgotten &lt;a href=&quot;http://traumwind.de/blog/&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; was also among the very first ETPers. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://traumwind.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$1&quot;&gt;his first post&lt;/a&gt; was just a few days before Andrea's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PapaScott was an early adopter of EditThisPage, but I'm not German, so I don't qualify.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/11/16/rotten-compromise</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In describing the CDU/CSU health care &quot;plan&quot;, I love how &lt;a title=&quot;Reuters AlertNet - German opposition ends row, has health plan&quot; href=&quot;http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L15592860.htm&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; starts with the phrase &quot;Germany's squabbling conservative opposition&quot;. The proposal has nothing to do with reforming the health care system, and everything to do with distributing party influence and power of Merkel and Stoiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I'm all for a health financing system that does away with the payroll tax and distributes the costs to everyone, not just wage earners. But this plan keeps a 6.5% payroll tax, while individuals pay ¬Ä109 per month (but no more than 7% of income). So we keep the old bureaucracy, add a new one, and the difference gets paid with taxes. Nothing about cost reduction or efficiency. Everyone loses, except for high wage earners. Is this client politics, or what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nico thinks &lt;a title=&quot;Gesundheits'konzept' der Union: Geht's noch? [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot; href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=950&quot;&gt;income taxes are a bad way&lt;/a&gt; to finance health care; I disagree, but of course the tax system needs to fixed first, and needs to stop financing silly things like coal mining, wind energy, house buying, and commuting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a last bit of not-so-subtlety from Reuters &quot;The two parties (CDU and CSU) have historically worked together.&quot; That's like saying that the team management fully supports the coach. If you have to say it out loud, it means it might no longer be true.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven't complained about my job in a while, and after this I promise not to complain again for another 3 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week is the ominous &quot;6 weeks before the end of the quarter&quot; deadline when either I or my employer can give notice of termination. I've decided not to leave entirely, but rather to reduce to half time starting 1 December. I had been working 32 hours under &lt;em&gt;Kurzarbeit&lt;/em&gt; (short time), but that has now been cancelled, so if I stayed I had to either go back to full time or reduce my hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospects for free-lancing are not as rosy as I had hoped, and it looks like despite everything that the company will survive. The environment has stabilized, and my work is fun and interesting again.  So I'll stick around and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was just telling Christopher that Mama is so far away in Australia, that it's already morning there even though it's evening here. He then starts explaining to me that the earth is round, Australia is on the other side of the earth from Germany, and that the earth rotates while the sun stays still. That's why it's already morning in Australia. He rotates his fist as the earth while holding the &quot;sun&quot; in his other hand to demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once he was convinced that I understood, he went back to his dessert.&lt;/p&gt;

That's sweet coming from a politican who had his country perform an instant about-face on Iraq upon his election. If foreign issues are resolved more on the basis of party politics rather than national interest, how can te EU of 25 have any sort of coherent foreign policy at all? Right now the EU &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be able to agree that the Earth is round and rotates around the sun, but only if Italy abstains. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/041106120808.wl2psr92&quot; title=&quot;EUbusiness - EU can become global power in 20 years: Spanish PM&quot;&gt;(EUbusiness - EU can become global power in 20 years: Spanish PM)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The release candidates for the Mac have been somewhat stable, but are still worse than 0.9.x. And they stil render certain GIFs improperly, like PhotoMatt's header and the star images at Amazon, at least for me. And under Linux, Firefox chokes, and sometimes freezes, on mistyped hostnames with slow DNS lookups. Maybe it works better on Windows, but I fear the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=node/view/4891&quot;&gt;hype&lt;/a&gt; is going to backfire. It's not ready.&lt;/p&gt;

If it rains, we'll just ride the streetcar all afternoon. Then we do the whole thing again in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In an inspired moment of creative fiscal policy, Finance Minister Eichel yesterday (with the approval of his boss the Chancellor) proposed moving the German Unity Day holiday to always fall on Sunday. This year a number of paid holidays fall on the weekend, thus adding a couple of tenths to national GDP, so why not have have a holiday fall always on the weekend? Alas, the idea fell like a lead balloon full of rocks. Maybe Eichel should hire some of those Greek statisiticians to rewrite the German calendar. My idea: move Unity Day to the day after Ascension, a nominal work day when noone works anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

Maybe so, and the Union is all so easy to trick these days, but it still must be nice to have a chump like Eichel to always be the fall guy for you when things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember the Lisbon Agenda, in which the EU pledged to become the world's most competitive economy by 2010? OK, stop laughing. Germany has come up with a plan on how the agenda can be met, namely by lowering the goal, a tactic which seems to work for domestic financial problems. So instead of competing right away with the United States, the EU can start by competing with, say, Khazakstan or Bangladesh. I personally think a better solution would be for the EU to hire &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eubusiness.com/afp/041021090354.2ted4mo5&quot; title=&quot;EUbusiness - EU attacks Greece over dodgy data&quot;&gt;Greek statisticians&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I remember about living in Minnesota is that it was illegal to buy alcohol on election day. &lt;a title=&quot;Minnesota DPS: Alcohol Enforcement: Frequently Asked Questions&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dps.state.mn.us/alcgamb/alcenf/alcfaq.html#when_open&quot;&gt;Nice to see that has changed.&lt;/a&gt; Prost. (Old news, I see. The election day liquor ban was lifted in &lt;a title=&quot;Sacred Sundays open for business&quot; href=&quot;http://www.in-forum.com/specials/century/jan3/week36.html&quot;&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, there's an election going on today, but as I've written before, I'm not all that convinced it matters much who wins. However, at home we're concentrating more on the illness of Mama's 90-year-old aunt, who lives 90 minutes away in Schleswig-Holstein, but has no immediate family, leaving it to the niece and nephews to arrange all that needs arranging (at least until Mama leaves for Sydney on Thursday). My impression from home is that, when you're sick, elderly and publicly insured, the German medical system totally sucks. Totally.&lt;/p&gt;

And once again, they have won a reprieve, for at least a few weeks. The employees agreed to defer most of their October salaries until December, when a recapitalization is planned, a condition for new investors. In return, the company paid the rest of our September salaries today. The future of the company is no more secure than before, but at least there is a plan for pulling away from the brink, which is something to say for the new management.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why is it that any time Spiegel Online reports on a topic about which I have personal knowledge, they turn out to be completely full of shit? Latest case in point, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,324622,00.html&quot; title=&quot;US-Wahlen in Deutschland: Marschbefehl zur Urne - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot;&gt;Marching Orders to Vote&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Bush Administration is supposedly hindering civilian expats from voting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bullshit. Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fvap.gov/&quot;&gt;fvap.gov website&lt;/a&gt;, it was never easier for me to arrange for my American absentee ballot than it was this year. I never had any problems reaching the site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000001/2004/09/23.html#a6620&quot; title=&quot;Adam Curry's Weblog&quot;&gt;even in September&lt;/a&gt; when the story of problems first surfaced (i.e. Spiegel is a month late on this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Medienkritiker are &lt;a href=&quot;http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/spiegel_online__5.html&quot; title=&quot;Davids Medienkritik: SPIEGEL ONLINE: Marching Orders to Vote&quot;&gt;calling Spiegel on this&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally my blogoll working with timestamps from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/services/&quot; title=&quot;Bloglines | Bloglines Services&quot;&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt;, using their API. It would be nice if Bloglines had a lastItem function, where you could get the latest n items for any feed. But you can only get the unread items or all items after a certain date/time. You also cannot be sure that the timestamps are consistent. And you are not assured of getting correct XML.  And the WebServices::BlogLines perl modules barfs if no items are returned. But once you work around all that, it's pretty easy. I'll post perl code once I get it cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems the timestamps from Bloglines are buggy, they use a 12-hour close but don't include AM/PM. So all timestamps get interpreted as being before noon GMT.&lt;/p&gt;

the amount of press coverage the US election receives here. It may seem&lt;br /&gt;
obvious to my American readers that their election should be covered in&lt;br /&gt;
full detail all across the world, but it's not. You're not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; important.  But we care anyway... On October 18, Norway's online newspapers published 52 articles mentioning John Kerry. On the same day, they published 18 articles mentioning our own prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.&quot; It's just as bad in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

News - Opel management, workers set for head-on clash as work stoppages continue&quot; href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;amp;u=/afp/20041018/bs_afp/germany_us_auto_strike_041018235539&quot;&gt;the wildcat strikers at the Opel factory in Bochum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, my present job doesn't really have much of a future either, so what do I know?&lt;/p&gt;

And I also remember thinking back then that, from his timing of the war, President Bush was handing the fate of his re-election away from US voters and to the Iraqi people. If, say, in the summer of 2004 the occupation is going badly, the Iraqis do not feel liberated and 'better off than they were 4 years ago', if US soldiers are still killing and being killed, Iraq would then dominate the US election and Bush would be like LBJ in 1968, namely toast.... Or, as &lt;a title=&quot;BuzzMachine: Bye bye Bush?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_08.html#004514&quot;&gt;Buzz Machine&lt;/a&gt; commented: 'The war was a success. But the peace is hell.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like I was wrong about LBJ and toast, but the peace has turned out to be more hellish that I ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night we hosted a &lt;em&gt;Laternenumzug&lt;/em&gt; for Christopher's &lt;em&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/em&gt;, even though Christopher has now graduated to Kindergarten and no longer attends day care. We had about 16 parents and 8 children marching in the drizzle through the fields with paper lanterns. We set up hay bales and some Halloween decorations in the carport, and offered pretzels and warm drinks. The kids played in the back yard, pretending it was not dark. Most of Heidi's kids are younger than 3, so most of the guests headed home by 8 pm.  A hard core stayed a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It will go unnoticed outside of Germany, but yesterday Friedrich Merz &lt;a title=&quot;Bloomberg.com: German CDU's Merz Quits as Deputy Party Leader in Parliament&quot; href=&quot;http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000100&amp;amp;sid=a2rf3q1E8yKQ&amp;amp;refer=germany&quot;&gt;resigned all of his party leadership positions in the CDU&lt;/a&gt;. Merz was the CDU fiscal and economic policy expert, and developed the CDU 3-rate tax reform plan. He was shoved aside as party faction leader by Merkel after the 2002 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His departure is a sign of the increasing Stoiberization of the CDU, away from concrete policy and towards coddling client voters (commuter subsidy, home-owner subsidy) and emotional polarization (Bundeswehr as domestic police, petition on Turkey). If the Union fails to gain power in 2006, it will be symbolic of the Union's failure to take advantage of Schr&amp;ouml;der's mid-term weakness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merz had a unique media presence. He's short and slightly balding, and had a habit of slightly bowing his head and looking up at the camera. It made him look like an evil monk, something out of The Name of the Rose. It distracted from his usually &lt;a title=&quot;Sehr geehrte Frau Vorsitzende, liebe Angela, [Lummaland - das Weblog]&quot; href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=804&quot;&gt;clear and consistent positions&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;No, it won't come to that, but the campaign does evoke ugly emotions.

&lt;p&gt;I actually stayed up and watched most of this game on the mlb.com video stream. As an afternoon game, it started at 10:30 pm German time, and I thought it might be my last chance to see Johan Santana pitch this year. Turned out I was right. Santana wasn't at his best, having had only 3 days rest, but had a few great moments. I didn't make it until the end, though. I went to bed at 2:30, after 10 innings, so I didn't see the bitter end. Sierra's tying home run in the 8th was bitter enough.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Slash My Permalinks</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/10/08/slash-my-permalinks/"/>
   <updated>2004-10-08T18:10:34+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/10/08/slash-my-permalinks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the puzzles I needed to solve when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/10/06/new-motor/&quot;&gt;switching back to Movable Type&lt;/a&gt; was how to keep my permalinks. Actually, most of the permalink was easy, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/15/slugs&quot; title=&quot;Cruft-free URLs in Movable Type [dive into mark]&quot;&gt;Mark Pilgrim's cruft-free URLs&lt;/a&gt;. The problem was the slash at the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've forgotten where, but somewhere I read that cool links end with a slash, since the URI is then a directory and it doesn't matter what filetype (if there is indeed a file at all) contains the page, the URI won't change. However, MT doesn't differentiate between the permalink and the filename that it saves. If you try to set MTEntryPermalink to a directory, MT tries to write to the directory instead of a file, which of course fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach is to set MTEntryPermalink to blah-blah/index.html, and write a one-line &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html#plugins&quot; title=&quot;add_global_filter(slashify=&amp;gt;sub{my $s=$_[0];$s=~s!index.[\w]*$!!g;$s;});&quot;&gt;global filter plugin&lt;/a&gt; to delete the filename from every instance of MTEntryPermalink in all templates. I tried it, but it's a pain to add an attribute to all those instances, and the trackback data was still wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better approach is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dribin.org/dave/blog/archives/2003/09/24/permalink_urls/&quot; title=&quot;Dave Dribin's blog: Fixing Movable Type's Permalink URLs&quot;&gt;Dave Dribin's patch to MT.pm&lt;/a&gt; so you can set MTEntryPermalink to a directory, and have MT save the template to a file index.html (or index.whatever). That's what I'm doing now, but of course the problem with a patch is that it's a patch, and you have to remember to re-apply it when MT 4.0 or 3.2 or 3.112384 is released. But maybe the same thing can be accomplished with the new plugin architecture in MT3. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, I'm not a German blogger, just a blogger in Germany, but here's a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health insurance: fixed premiums &lt;em&gt;(Kopfpauschale)&lt;/em&gt; or universal insurance based on income &lt;em&gt;(B&amp;uuml;rgerversicherung)&lt;/em&gt;. All parties agree that the current system based on wages needs reform. However, merely extending the system to include more types of income is a half-hearted reform. Health care is too important to be a rich vs. poor issue. Everyone deserves the same care, all the time. Of course the costs need to be distributed fairly. The state already has an mechanism for distributing costs... the income tax system. The health care system needs to be decoupled from income, otherwise when we have a boom-and-bust economy, we'll also have boom-and-bust health care. I don't want my heath care to bust. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, we get paystubs, since being Germany, paychecks are direct deposited. But no paystubs either, meaning the money hasn't yet been transferred, and the money always takes 2 or 3 days to hit the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Alexanderplatz</title>

   <updated>2004-10-04T19:10:26+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/10/04/alexanderplatz</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/alex2004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our first afternoon in Berlin, we didn't hit any of the tourist spots. Instead we went to Alexanderplatz, one of the ugliest spots on the face of the earth. Alexanderplatz was an eyesore even in DDR times, being an epitome of socialist architecture. Nowadays it's not just an eyesore, but dirty, rundown, and under construction. The only redeeming feature is the funky world clock where you can read the time in such places as Pyongyang and Vladivostok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has a special place in our hearts. In April 1985 we were in Germany for our church wedding, and we spent a few days in Berlin to present ourselves to my in-laws, East and West. One afternoon we slipped over to the East by ourselves, and ended up on the patio of a high-rise hotel on Alexanderplatz, drinking beer in the sun at 60 DDR-Pf (about 10 US cents) per 0.5 liter and talking nonsense with some medical school dropout who wanted to somehow move west. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/opener.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;opener&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;This was our second or third day in East Berlin, and having exchanged for 25 East Marks each day, there was no way we could drink our way through our DDR currency. So we went shopping at the department store, and bought dishes. And a East German flag. And some beer openers, engraved with the price: EVP 0,15. I still have one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a high-rise hotel, although they don't seem to have a patio with a beer garden. But there's a self-service kiosk with tables outside across the street, next to the world clock. Beer is now ¬Ä2.20, plus deposit. We stopped for a half an hour, wondered where the past 20 years had gone, and watched the world go by. Noone stopped at our table wanting to move west.&lt;/p&gt;

On Saturday we took in some of the sights. At the Reichstag, the Volksfest for the national holiday on 3 October was already underway. There was a stage with Schlager music, booths with grilled and fried junk food, and lots of trinkets for sale. On the Reichstag lawn dozens of people were playing something that looked like a cross between bocce ball and ring toss. No security of any sort was noticeable. The sun was out,  weather was gorgeous, and I could think of no better atmosphere for a national holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, my post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/27/stars/&quot; title=&quot;PapaScott - Stars&quot;&gt;Stars&lt;/a&gt;  generated a number of mails from my non-virtual community, er, I mean from friends and relatives, with suggestions on where to find star stickers (with Christmas decorations) and wondering if I was really serious about reforming German education with sticky bits of glossy paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to clarify, the post was written with tongue in cheek. My experience with German education is zero, other than what is reported in the media, and all I really know is that children start first grade with a paper cone full of toys and candy, and come out 10 or 12 or 13 years later with an &lt;em&gt;Abitur&lt;/em&gt; or an apprenticeship. I have no idea what happens in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the writing in my weblog to experiment, to try new points of view, to strike poses, to distract myself from the real world. The viewpoints expressed here may have no basis in reality. I don't always tell the truth, but I never lie. The posts here are a mixture of fact, fiction and imagination, and the recipe is different every day. Enjoy the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think I have discovered a reason for the poor showing of Germany in recent international studies of education systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying to encourage Christopher to, ah, keep his bed dry at night, with only partial success thus far. Last week I had the idea to reward him with a gold star on his calendar for every successful night. Christopher thought it was a wonderful idea (especially after Mama said he could redeem 3 stars for a present).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, none of the stationery shops I checked in Hamburg carried gold star stickers. They had plain white square stickers, or colored dots, but no stars. How can a child feel rewarded at school, at church, or wherever without being able to earn gold stars for attendance, good homework, or whatever? Where is the motivation to succeed? Is the only motivation to avoid mistakes, to avoid red marks? Is there no positive reinforcement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I couldn't find any star stickers, I did find multi-colored star-shaped confetti. We have to supply our own glue, but it's working quite nicely. We've haven't had a damp night since we started awarding stars, and Mama already has to redeem her first present.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent the morning renting a tuxedo, something I do every 10 years or so. No, noone I know is getting married. Mama's firm sponsors a charity which is having a benefit gala in Berlin next weekend, and her boss has made it clear that it would be very good if she were to attend. So we get to go to Berlin and watch millionaires spend money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first attempt in Hamburg yesterday was a failure, as the shop was too small and didn't do alterations, which left us both in a sour mood. Last night I searched Google and found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guenstige-brautkleider.de/&quot; title=&quot;Brautmoden Haupt in Hamburg&quot;&gt;Brautmoden Haupt in Hamburg Barmbek&lt;/a&gt;. Frau Haupt had my size, was willing to cut several centimeters from the arms and legs, and had me set up in a half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adventure of the tuxedo is going to cost me in all 4 trips into the city (the failed trip yesterday, the successful trip today, the pick-up on Thursday, and the return next Monday), but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make to make my wife look good. As if I have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;State elections today in Brandenburg and Sachsen, and the media at home and abroad is bemoaning that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3669974.stm&quot; title=&quot;BBC NEWS | Europe&quot;&gt;German far right makes poll gains&lt;/a&gt;. While the results of the far-right (9% in Sachsen, 6% in Brandenburg) make nice headlines, they miss the point. The real story is the failure of both main parties to maintain their ground. In both Sachsen (CDU 41.9, SPD 9.5) and Brandenburg (SPD 32.1, CDU 19.4), the two &lt;em&gt;Volksparteien&lt;/em&gt; combined for barely over 50%. Neither Schr√∂der nor Merkel/Stoiber/Koch have the confidence of voters in the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big winners were the post-Communist PDS, finishing strong second in both contests. Does this foreshadow a return of the PDS to the Bundestag in 2006, tipping the result to deny victory to both SPD and Union?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the far right, they've always been utterly incompetent at parliamentary work, so expect the factions to self-destruct sooner than later. The worst thing is that this result entitles the fringe parties to increased state financing, which is based on voter counts. Not that the main parties would ever agree to reform their finances and eliminate such state subsidies. They themselves are too dependent on them.&lt;/p&gt;

Bild am Sonntag is reporting that a bill to be introduced in the Bundesrat would &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/news/2004/09/19/ladenschluss__aus/ladenschluss__aus.html&quot; title=&quot;Bild.T-Online.de - Nachrichten - 10 Bundesl√§nder machen mit: Ladenschluss- Revolution!&quot;&gt;transfer control of shop hours from the federal government to the states &lt;/a&gt;. Such a bill almost certainly pass the Bundestag as well, since both major parties support it. Ten of the 16 German &lt;em&gt;L√§nder&lt;/em&gt; would probably then do away with  restrictions on shop hours altogether Mon-Sat, while keeping the ban on Sundays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll believe it first when I see it, but labor unions certainly have less influence on state goverments than on the national Red/Green coalition, so it could actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've returned from our getaway on Tegernsee, which seems to be the Munich equivalent of the Alster, with the same high real estate prices, except that it's outside the city, not right in it. Very poor traffic planning, there were always traffic jams. Lots of private clinics though. It must be the dream of every German doctor to open a private clinic on Tegernsee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I've spent any time in Bavaria (outside of Munich, which according to the Munichers I know is not part of Bavaria at all, despite being the Bavarian capital). Maybe it's just the north German prejudices that I've picked up, but it didn't feel very German at all. It felt more like Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll quit now that I've insulted all of the German-speaking regions of Europe (including the Swiss, by not mentioning them).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is triple Mozilla witching day, with new releases of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; (browser) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/&quot;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt; (mail client) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; (kitchen sink) (which makes 9 downloads for those of us using Mac/Windows/Linux). Most interesting is  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unclespam.org/2004/09/mozilla-adds-rss-support-to-firefox.html&quot;&gt;the addition of RSS/Atom feed readers&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;strike&gt;all three&lt;/strike&gt; er, the first two products. At first glance the integration into Thunderbird mail folders seems more useful than Firefox dynamic bookmarks, but to each his own, and the more readers the merrier.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Schabat Schalom</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/14/schabat-schalom</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NDRInfo, our regional news radio station, runs a Jewish culture program on Fridays called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndrinfo.de/ndrinfo_pages_std/0,2758,SPM690,00.html&quot;&gt;Schabat Schalom&lt;/a&gt;. Last week (or was it the week before) they had a nice talk on bi- and multi-lingual puns. Plays on words always involve some sort of secret knowledge to get the joke, and if you have to explain yourself, the joke is lost. For example, I titled my last post on the Tower of Light tribute in NYC &lt;em&gt;Leuchtturm&lt;/em&gt; (&quot;lighthouse&quot;), which breaks down into &quot;light&quot; and &quot;tower&quot;. Only a non-native speaker of German would think of calling the tribute a &lt;em&gt;Leuchtturm&lt;/em&gt;, and now that I've explained it, the humor is gone...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the rabbi last week explained how &quot;sabos&quot; were the course wooden shoes of early industrial workers in France, and when they would protest their poor working conditions by stuffing their shoes into the machines, they were committing &quot;sabotage&quot;. In the same way, the sabbath forces our hectic way of life to come to a halt for at least one day a week, a form of &quot;Schabat-tage&quot;. And if you choose to celebrate the sabbath by buying expensive Italian olive-oil bread, you then have &quot;Ciabat-tage&quot;, which if you pronounce Italian poorly enough sounds nearly the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A French-English-Hebrew-Italian pun, told in German. I was impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Can you remember the day of the week of the important dates in your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was married on Tuesday. That's easy, it was the day after Labor Day. My son was born early on Monday morning, the night of a killer storm. We arrived in Germany to stay on Saturday afternoon; all the shops were closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twins won the '87 World Series on Sunday, but the 7th game of the World Series always falls on Sunday. The same for the last German World Cup victory. World Cup finals always fall on Sunday, both for men and for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes my memory plays tricks on me. I remember the Challenger exploding on Wednesday, and the Berlin Wall falling on Friday, but both are a day too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/12/the-day-the-earth-stood-still/&quot;&gt;9/11 was on Tuesday. I learned of the first crash at 3pm Hamburg time. The towers fell 90 minutes later as I was driving home from work, listening to NDRInfo. At home our satellite receiver was broken; we tried desparately to set up a tabletop antenna to watch ARD.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days I remember better than others.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/11/enough-for-now</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That's enough of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/bl.php&quot;&gt;Bloglines layout&lt;/a&gt; for now. It might come back some day, though. I find the layout very functional, and I may work out actual templates with a sidebar and more weblog-like features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick yesterday was to use wget to get the public copy of my blog from bloglines, insert a &amp;lt;base href...&amp;gt; in the html header so the relative links worked correctly, and add bl.php to the beginning of the DirectoryIndex line in my .htaccess to make it the default page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all powered by an hourly cron job, since bloglines reads my blog only once per hour. It's not a script, but a one-liner with sed. If I put the long bloglines URL into a tinyurl, it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/wget -O - 'http://tinyurl.com/5zekr' | sed -e 's/&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;base href=&quot;http:&amp;#92;/&amp;#92;/www.bloglines.com&amp;#92;/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;PapaScott/' &amp;gt; /usr/local/www/data/bl.php&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been one of those weeks, or actually, one of those two weeks (bi-weeks?). It's budget season for Mama, so she's had 6 day weeks and is gone more often than not, and is sometimes gone even when she's here. Meanwhile, while Christopher has surely gotten into the rhythm of his kindergarten schedule, I most certainly have not. When Mama is gone I've got 6 hours of non-stop Christopher, which is more exhausting (and infinitely more satisifying) than my 6 hours of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping I could at least be semi-productive during my extra hours with him, but it turns out my productivity when we are alone is actually zero. He's loud, assertive, and always wanting to communicate. That's very good for his speech development, but very bad for concentrating on anything else in his presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top things off, Christopher was home sick from kindergarten the past two days. Yesterday, Mama stayed home with him, and he slept with a fever most of the day. Today, I was home; he woke up at 6 am, at 8 am he declared himself for healthy and he has been moving at full speed ever since. Another non-productive day, although it's not like I'm missing anything at work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Diana from Beslan</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/05/diana-from-beslan</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like the entire world, we've been horrified by the news and pictures from Beslan, where likely 500 hostages were killed in terrorist attack on a school. For Americans, Beslan is half a world away. In Germany we are somewhat closer, both geographically and through the thousands of immigrants from Russia. Our local paper had the story of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2004/09/04/337176.html&quot; title=&quot;Diana - in Hamburg verfolgt sie das Drama um ihre Heimat&quot;&gt;Diana from Beslan&lt;/a&gt;. I've translated portions (and the fact that a certified Russian teacher can only to Germany only as an Au-Pair also speaks volumes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg  - Diana Kanukowa (23) can hardly believe the television pictures she is seeing from her hometown of Beslan. She almost would have been at the school as a teacher. &quot;I had an offer last year. But I wanted to go abroad first. That's why I'm here and not there.&quot; Diana studied German and English in Ossetia. Since February she has been an Au-Pair for a family in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again she points at the TV. A man with a white shirt and a machine gun: &quot;That's our local police chief.&quot; She recognizes a distressed woman in a brown dress as the school librarian...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terror attack in her hometown caught her totally by surprise. &quot;The attacks usually only take place in the big cities. She believe that the town of 35,000 was chosen by chance. The attack, she belives, was planned for an annual festival on September first in the Ossetian capital of Vladikavaz. The school where the hostages were held is directly on the highway to the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her family lives on the same highway. Other than her mother, a nurse who is caring for the injured, noone has been allowed on the street. One of her neighbors escaped from the school Thursday with her 3 children, one a baby. Diana believes that most of the adult male hostages are dead. &quot;My mother heard that from an injured victim in the hospital&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diana is unsure whether she will return to Beslan next year. She has applied at the University of Hamburg to study Russian and Education.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2004-09-04T19:09:13+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/04/state-of-my-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three weeks after the layoffs in my department were announced, our new boss finally met with those of us who remain to discuss where things go from here. One of the layoffs was reinstated, so we have 2.25 full-time equivalent admins (1 full-time, 2 part-time), 1 specialist each for PCs, Solaris and Linux/BSD. It could work as long as noone gets sick or takes vacation, and nothing breaks. Meanwhile, the rumor is that September payroll cannot be met, so this might be the last dance on the Titanic anyway. I've got vague plans for that possibility. I've got an application in for a dream job, but I can't count on that, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher still loves his kindergarten, and is still excited to catch the bus each morning. We had a first conference with the speech therapist, and she had 90 minutes worth of ideas (and she was just getting started). We meet with her again this week. Funny thing is, the one having the most trouble adjusting to the new schedule is me. I'm now working 8am to 2pm, and I've got 2 to 3 extra hours with Christopher per day, and I'm not yet entirely sure what to do with them. This week Mama was away all week. Mornings are now easier that Christopher is picked up so early, but I'm still exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new car (VW Lupo) is running fine, and we've even got sunroof weather now. I put in my first tank of bio-diesel yesterday, at 85 cents per liter (gasoline is about 1.20). Vegetable oil from Aldi is even cheaper, and is rumored to work in diesel Lupos, but I'm not brave enough to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Export from WordPress</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/01/export-from-wordpress/"/>
   <updated>2004-09-01T02:09:03+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/09/01/export-from-wordpress</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5 May 2005&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot of people seem to be using this script. Since I'm not using WordPress right now, I haven't really been maintaining it. A better alternative might be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://epierce.blog.usf.edu/?p=15&quot; title=&quot;Eric Pierce: WPexport 0.2&quot;&gt;WPexport&lt;/a&gt; plugin by Eric Pierce, since, unlike me, he regularly exports WordPress blogs (for students at the University of South Florida).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/06/15/Archive-Restore&quot;&gt;paraphrase Sam Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, a weblog software is only as good as its export function. So &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2004/08/26/exit-door/&quot;&gt;inspired&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2004/08/22/mt-and-wp-there-and-back-again/&quot;&gt;by&lt;/a&gt; Shelley, starting from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billgrady.com/mt/archives/000064.php&quot;&gt;b2 export script by Bill Grady&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/08/launched_movabl.shtml&quot;&gt;celebrate the release of Movable Type 3.1&lt;/a&gt;, I've just made WordPress a hell of a lot better. I humbly present Version 0.1 of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/examples/export_wp.phps&quot;&gt;export script for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; for the Movable Type import format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few caveats, apart from the usual it-works-for-me, your-mileage-may-vary and backup-your-data-first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. It does not deal (yet) with entries with multiple categories. I don't use multiple categories, so I don't need this, but it could be done by adding yet another JOIN statement to the SQL and some fiddling with the output logic.&lt;br /&gt;
2. There are a few settings that I've chosen not to read from WordPress, but instead to set explicitly in the script. If you look in the print_post function, you'll see&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;echo (&quot;STATUS: Publish&amp;#47;n&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;
echo (&quot;ALLOW COMMENTS: 2&amp;#47;n&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;
echo (&quot;CONVERT BREAKS: markdown&amp;#47;n&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;
echo (&quot;ALLOW PINGS: 0&amp;#47;n&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    I.e., all posts are published, all comments are closed, all pings are allowed, and all posts are filtered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt;. You may want to change these or comment them out to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The post slug from WordPress is copied into the key words field. To keep your existing URLs, you'll want to use a solution like &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/15/slugs&quot;&gt;Mark Pilgrim's cruft-free URLs&lt;/a&gt;. Note also that Movable Type uses underscores in their URLs; to have MT produce dashes automatically you'll need a plugin of some sort. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. When importing, make sure your character set matches whatever you were using with WordPress. Both WordPress and Movable Type now use UTF-8 by default, but if you're using something else, you'll want to adjust MT accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. I'm also not yet dealing with extended entries, although that would also be easy enough to do. Everything gets thrown into the main post for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strike&gt;If you search the WordPress forums, you'll notice that inquiries about exporting to Movable Type are met with abuse and derision. Be prepared for the same if you actually use this script to export your blog to Movable Type.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be happy to update the script if anyone cares to correct any of these caveats (or anything else that I haven't thought of). For your abuse and derision, you can see the result of the export at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mt.papascott.de/&quot;&gt;http://mt.papascott.de/&lt;/a&gt; (temporary URL, don't go linking to it or anything).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Family Hanson,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Christopher and I drew a life-sized Christopher. While drawing we discussed what he enjoys doing (building Legos, riding bike, etc.). We also thought about what one does with the eyes, the nose, the mouth. Christopher said that one needs a mouth to keep closed at night and to eat spaghetti. I then had the idea, that one also needs a mouth in order to speak. For some children speaking is easy, for others it is more difficult. But one can learn to speak more easily. Christopher and I have decided to do that together. After all, I am a speech teacher. Now he wants to know what I am writing. I'll read it to him aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings,&lt;br /&gt;
B. (Christopher's speech therapist)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We have a notebook with which we communicate with Christopher's kindergarten. Today's note was a follow-up to a conference we had with her last week.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>15 Minutes of Concentration</title>

   <updated>2004-08-22T15:08:46+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/22/15-minutes-of-concentration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whenever I try to get any work done at home while watching Christopher, I have to think of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/global/English/Articles/WheredoThesePeopleGetThei.html&quot; title=&quot;Joel on Software - Where do These People Get Their (Unoriginal) Ideas?&quot;&gt;article by Joel Sponsky&lt;/a&gt; where he writes that it takes (at least) 15 minutes for a programmer to start concentrating on solving a problem, and that with every interruption, you have to start that concentration time over from zero. How often does a 4-year-old leave a parent alone for 15 minutes? Yes, my point exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/22/15-minutes-of-concentration/#more-2022&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; is the Movable Type 3.x plugin for which I've been trying to write a front-end. It emulates the WordPress function in which you can automatically moderate a comment with several hyperlinks. Save this as &lt;code&gt;MT_DIR/plugins/modhref.pl&lt;/code&gt;, and set $maxhref to the maximum number of links you want to allow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was half-way done, I saw that it would pretty much be a knock-off of Chad Everett's &lt;a href=&quot;http://jayseae.cxliv.org/moderate/&quot;&gt;Moderate plugin&lt;/a&gt;, just using a different critereon for moderation (Moderate checks the age of the posting and the lastest comment for the post, and moderates if either is too old). The criteria could probably be combined into a single plugin to perform simple tests on comments not explicitly banned by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/&quot;&gt;MT-Blacklist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;# Modhref: Moderate comments with too many links.

$VERSION = '0.01';

my $maxhref = 4; # maximum number of links before a comment is moderated

My translation: &quot;There's nothing wrong with saying 'you can see the athlete is disappointed', but why do they have to say things like 'that's very disappointing for us' or 'Germany is deeply disappointed with the result'? For example, in the USA when an American athlete is successful, the media will report on him extensively. If the results are not that good, they will remain silent. In Germany the successes are only briefly mentioned, but the failures are analyzed in every detail and the pain of the athletes are shown for days, even weeks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Given today's gas prices, we looked seriously at a diesel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lupousa.com/&quot;&gt;VW Lupo 3L TDI&lt;/a&gt; (3L stands for 3 liters/100 km, or 78 mpg). However, they are hard to find used, and come at a pretty premium to their less efficient cousins. We expanded our search to all diesel Lupos, found an SDI nearby with a foldback sunroof (very important :-)), and signed the contract today. By Friday I'll be driving German after 12 years of driving French.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At work, my department has been dissolved. My boss and three colleagues have been laid off, two of us will stay. The Betriebsrat tried to get a court order to block the action, but failed. I asked for a release from my contract, but was refused. I thought about submitting my resignation (which would mean giving up severance pay and unemployment benefits), which would have been due today (6 weeks before end of the quarter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to stay. I don't have faith that the company will survive, but I don't yet have a concrete alternative. Worst case, I'd be better off financially with insolvency or being laid off than with leaving. And there's a chance that things will get better. If they don't, my next chance to resign is mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the &quot;happy&quot; solution I mentioned yesterday (that would have been a release), but it will have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hello World as an MT::App CGI</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/12/hello-world-as-an-mtapp-cgi/"/>
   <updated>2004-08-12T04:08:11+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/12/hello-world-as-an-mtapp-cgi</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been waiting for a consumer version of Movable Type 3 before taking a look at it, having been bitten by a couple of bugs in the developer version and the lack of (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/07/plug_in_to_mova.shtml&quot;&gt;now award-winning&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/&quot;&gt;MT-Blacklist&lt;/a&gt;. Both will soon be alleviated in the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/news/2004/07/movable_type_31_whats_new.shtml&quot; title=&quot;Movable Type Publishing Platform: Movable Type 3.1: What's New&quot;&gt;Movable Type 3.1&lt;/a&gt;, scheduled for August 31, which means it may or may not be already in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason enough to look again at MT3 and the plugin architecture. I had an idea for a plugin, and it took all of one hour to write up. (More on that later.) But then I wanted to be able to use a CGI to set a couple of configuration variables. And there I got stuck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/docs/plugin-tut.html#interface%20guidelines&quot; title=&quot;Writing a plugin&quot;&gt;plugin tutorial&lt;/a&gt; says that &quot;The best way to (build a human interface for your plugin) is to write a subclass of MT::App&quot; without really explaining how to do that. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtapi_mt_app.html&quot; title=&quot;MT::App&quot;&gt;docs for MT::App&lt;/a&gt; are a bit sparse on the subject as well. There are a number of mature plugins that build interfaces in this way, but looking at them, I felt like I was looking at the blueprints of the Empire State Building, when at first all I want to build is a hut on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally when I was looking at Chad Everett's &lt;a href=&quot;http://jayseae.cxliv.org/movable_type/notifier/&quot; title=&quot;MT-Notifier&quot; plugin=&quot;&quot; for=&quot;&quot; movable=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;&quot;&gt;MT-Notifier&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/07/plug_in_to_mova.shtml&quot;&gt;also award-winning&lt;/a&gt;) did the light bulb turn on inside my head and I saw the light. It took me 4 files, each in a different directory, but I was able to write a Hello World CGI plugin for Movable Type 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need a &lt;code&gt;MT_DIR/plugins/hello.pl&lt;/code&gt;. It doesn't do anything except register the plugin so I get a nice link to my CGI on the MT main page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;package MT::Plugin::Hello;
use strict;
use MT;
use MT::Plugin;
use vars qw($VERSION);
$VERSION = '0.1';
my $about = {
  name =&amp;gt; 'MT-Hello',
  config_link =&amp;gt; '../mt-hello.cgi',
  description =&amp;gt; 'Say hello to the world in a unique way.',
  doc_link =&amp;gt; 'http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/12/hello-world-as-an-mtapp-cgi/'
}; 
MT-&amp;gt;add_plugin(new MT::Plugin($about));&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next comes the CGI itself in &lt;code&gt;MT_DIR/mt-hello.cgi&lt;/code&gt;, which does nothing but call my subclass of MT::App. Most plugin CGIs look exactly like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
my($MT_DIR);
BEGIN {
  if ($0 =~ m!(.*[/])!) {
    $MT_DIR = $1;
  } else {
    $MT_DIR = './';
  }
  unshift @INC, $MT_DIR . 'lib';
  unshift @INC, $MT_DIR . 'extlib';
}
eval {
  require shanson::hello;
  my $app = shanson::hello-&amp;gt;new (
    Config =&amp;gt; $MT_DIR . 'mt.cfg',
    Directory =&amp;gt; $MT_DIR
  ) or die shanson::hello-&amp;gt;errstr;
  local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { $app-&amp;gt;trace ($_[0]) };
  $app-&amp;gt;run;
};
if ($@) {
  print &quot;Content-Type: text/htmlnn&quot;;
  print &quot;An error occurred: $@&quot;;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the meat and potatoes in &lt;code&gt;MT_DIR/extlib/shanson/hello.pm&lt;/code&gt;, where I say that all I really want my &lt;code&gt;$app&lt;/code&gt; to do is print some text. I require a login only so I get a pretty header on the page. &lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I've incorporated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/12/hello-world-as-an-mtapp-cgi/#comment-1501&quot;&gt;Phil Ringalda's suggestions&lt;/a&gt;. The sub uri is so the pretty header links back to the proper mt.cgi instead of mt-hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;package shanson::hello;
use strict;
use MT::App::CMS;
use vars qw(@ISA $VERSION);
@ISA = qw(MT::App::CMS);
$VERSION = '0.1';
sub uri {
  $_[0]-&amp;gt;path . MT::ConfigMgr-&amp;gt;instance-&amp;gt;AdminScript;
}
sub init {
  my $app = shift;
  $app-&amp;gt;SUPER::init (@_) or return;
  $app-&amp;gt;add_methods (hello =&amp;gt; &amp;amp;hello);
  $app-&amp;gt;{default_mode} = 'hello';
  $app-&amp;gt;{requires_login} = 1 ;
  $app-&amp;gt;{user_class} = 'MT::Author';
  $app-&amp;gt;{is_admin} = 1;
  $app;
}
sub hello {
  my $app = shift;
  my %param = (no_breadcrumbs =&amp;gt; 1);
  $app-&amp;gt;build_page('hello.tmpl', %param);
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I put a template file in &lt;code&gt;MT_DIR/tmpl/cms/hello.tmpl&lt;/code&gt;, so my class knows what it is supposed to print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;tmpl_include NAME=&quot;header.tmpl&quot;&amp;gt;
Hello, world!
&amp;lt;tmpl_include NAME=&quot;footer.tmpl&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no description of a web application is complete without a couple of screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main screen:&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/hello_main.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/hello_mainthumb.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Main screen&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CGI screen:&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/hello_cgi.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/hello_cgithumb.gif&quot; alt=&quot;CGI screen&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just have to write a CGI that actually does something, like, ummm, what did I want to do again? Oh yes, set a couple of configuration variables for my plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 28 Oct 2004:&lt;/strong&gt; David Jacobs noticed some missing backslashes, which I'm guessing went missing when I reimported all my blog entries into Movable Type. Sorry about that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 Mar 2005&lt;/strong&gt; MySQL ate my blackslashes again! Crucial backslashes were missing in &lt;code&gt;$app-&amp;gt;add_methods (hello =&amp;gt; &amp;amp;hello);&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$app-&amp;gt;build_page('hello.tmpl', %param);&lt;/code&gt;. Thanks to the ProNet mailing list for pointing this out in February and to Nathanial Irons for reminding me that I hadn't yet corrected this page.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seeing Alwin report &lt;a href=&quot;http://ahawkins.org/index.php?p=1012&quot; title=&quot;code: theWebSocket; ? Another wave of malware in the pipe&quot;&gt;a plump phishing attempt&lt;/a&gt; to obtain online banking passwords got me wondering. Why haven't I heard of anyone phishing for German banking passwords? There are, after all, a few million online banking customers in Germany. Probably because a password alone wouldn't get you very far. Ever since the days of 300 baud and Bildschirmtext, German banks have required both a PIN (general password) and a TAN (one-time transaction code) to conduct any business. It's inconvenient, and not 100% safe (nothing is), but better than relying on a password alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern version of the TAN is the mobile TAN. Your register your cell phone number with the bank. When you make a transaction, the screen gives you a number to call within 90 seconds. You call in with your cell phone, the incoming number is recognized, and the transaction is approved. They are no less safe than normal TANs, and easier to use on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention the mobile TANs also because they are something my employer developed for the German Postbank. The project manager thought it would be cute to integrate mobile TANs into our bugtracker, the open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mantisbt.org&quot;&gt;Mantis&lt;/a&gt; (want a patch? get an mTAN!), so the past few days I've been playing with a web service client under PHP. Cute, as I said, but not particularly useful.&lt;/p&gt;

This is why I don't like the death penalty, or Guantanamo, or the more draconian parts of the war on terror. It's not just that I think they're immoral; that, after all, can be a legitimate point of contention. I just don't trust the government at any level to be competent.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;German grammar makes for strange bedfellows. The news publishers Axel Springer (Bild) and Spiegel, which normally don't agree on anything, have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.axelspringer.de/inhalte/pressese/inhalte/presse/3760.html&quot;&gt;jointly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,311777,00.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that that they will &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsPackageArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&amp;amp;storyID=560816&amp;amp;section=news&quot; title=&quot;Reuters | German publishers in revolt over spelling&quot;&gt;abandon the German spelling reform&lt;/a&gt;, joining the FAZ newspaper as major media using the old (classic?) German spelling rules. Reformed spelling has been taught in schools since 1998, and was to become mandatory in 2005, although I'm not really sure how a government can mandate proper spelling. Wouldn't it be better for spelling to be outsourced to experts like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.duden.de/&quot;&gt;Duden&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for German blogs, as a non-native speaker I don't really care about spelling, but I do find &lt;a href=&quot;http://revirement.de/weblog/&quot;&gt;lack of capitalization&lt;/a&gt; somewhat hard to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won't be long now until you join us in the &quot;penguin group&quot;. We'll meet tomorrow at 9:30 in our group and we'll have breakfast together with all parents and children.

&lt;p&gt;We're already looking forward to having you,&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Quit whining, Germany!</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/04/quit-whining-germany</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a public service, here's a translation of the post &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.x-ploration.de/archiv/2004/08/03/hoer-auf-zu-jammern-deutschland/&quot;&gt;&quot;H√∂r auf zu Jammern, Deutschland!&quot;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.x-ploration.de/&quot;&gt;Thomas Gigold&lt;/a&gt; that was requested by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/002381.shtml&quot; title=&quot;Stop the whining by Heiko Hebig&quot;&gt;Heiko&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know what? There's something wrong with the Ossis! Last night 7000 people in Magdeburg and Dessau demonstrated against &lt;a href=&quot;#hartz4&quot;&gt;Hartz IV*&lt;/a&gt;. They want to keep everything as it is until... until when?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come on, what do these people expect? Hartz IV is right. Hartz IV is the only way that the &lt;em&gt;social state&lt;/em&gt; Germany can continue. A way that Germany has to take. Everyone demands reform, but when it comes to their own money, no, the evil, overpaid politicians aren't allowed to take that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, sorry. First they demonstrate for bananas (and then buy them green, assuming that the yellow ones are overripe), then they complain that noone has a job anymore (that's the &lt;em&gt;free market&lt;/em&gt; that they were always warned about in school), and now they complain that Papa State has no money left to pay them for sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And before anyone tells me I don't know what it's like... forget it. I know what it's like for a couple to live on 400 Euros a month and pay for both food and rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what bothers me even more than Bild headlines are whining Germans. Oh, back then, everything was sooooo much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, there are not enough jobs. Yes, the East is a catastrophe. And yes, life is not as good as 20 years ago. And then? Then tackle the problem! And don't think Frau Ossi Merkel will do any more for you. Me, I'm going now to buy some earplugs... &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;hartz4&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;Hartz IV is the consolidation of long-term unenemployment and social welfare payments that takes effect next year.&lt;/p&gt;

The sub-title read &quot;Dependent Newspaper&quot; rather than &quot;Independent Newspaper&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that the independence of the FR has been &lt;a title=&quot;Reaktionen auf SPD-Einstieg: Zweifel an Unabh√§ngigkeit der Frankfurter Rundschau - FAZ.NET&quot; href=&quot;http://www.faz.net/s/RubFAE83B7DDEFD4F2882ED5B3C15AC43E2/Doc~E24735D91E279479BB43D51079E83604E~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html&quot;&gt;called into question&lt;/a&gt; since being taken over by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ddvg.de/&quot;&gt;ddvg&lt;/a&gt;, the media holding of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spd.de/&quot;&gt;SPD&lt;/a&gt; (yes, the political party) which owns a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ddvg.de/wirberuns/unserebeteiligungen&quot;&gt;number of German regional papers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher's favorite website is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airbus.com/media/video_clips.asp&quot;&gt;video page at Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, especially the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airbus.com/video/media/mpegs/concorde_l.mpg&quot;&gt;Concorde's final landing&lt;/a&gt;. So it was only natural that he wanted a toy Concorde of his very own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At German toy stores we could only find tiny models for collectors for ¬Ä20, but on eBay we found a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.givesomecharacter.com/phdi/p1.nsf/supppages/givesome?OpenDocument&amp;amp;part=14&quot;&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; in Great Britain that  sold a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corgi.co.uk/CorgiSite/pages/product/product.asp?ctlg=Corgi&amp;amp;ctgry=Toys&amp;amp;prod=59902&quot;&gt;model by Corgi&lt;/a&gt; for around ¬Ä12 (incl. postage).

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/08/03/black-thursday</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven't mentioned the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/07/14/as-the-world-churns/&quot;&gt;soap opera that is my workplace&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of weeks, so here's the latest. Workers rejected the salary rejection proposal from management, and since there there has been official silence. We know the investor insists on cost cuts and he maintains that our developer salaries are too high (hint, hint). Rumor has it that management is not taking the hint and will be making cuts in non-productive departments (i.e. everythng &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; development). The rumor is that sysadmins will be reduced by 50%. If that's the case, then staying would probably be worse than leaving. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should know for sure in a week or two. Our employment contracts can be terminated 6 weeks before quarter's end, so the next deadline is Thursday, 19 August. The Betriebsrat must be informed of layoffs a week ahead of time. Social criteria must be taken into account when deciding on layoffs, so age, marital status, and number of children matter more than longevity or skills. So if you want to keep your job, don't bother with extra training... start having kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The latest rumor is that the last rumor is untrue, and that no sysadmins will be laid off this quarter. So who knows what is really up? Tune in next week... same bat-time, same bat-channel!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;blogg.de is a German combination of Blogspot and Technorati... it's a floor wax &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a desert topping!* Er, I mean it's a hoster &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an aggregator. And like Technorati, it's been having it's problems lately. Nico mentions his current  &lt;a href=&quot;http://lumma.de/eintrag.php?id=467&quot; title=&quot;mysqlsnapshot [Lummaland]&quot;&gt;love/hate relationship with MySQL&lt;/a&gt; and the Zawondny tool &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mysqlsnapshot/&quot;&gt;mysqlsnapshot&lt;/a&gt;.

I found it helpful when rearranging IPs for my absolutely-has-to-be-up bugtracker database. Generally, I've found that problems I seem to be having with MySQL can either be tuned away or are actually with the operating system. So don't lose hope!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We  tried to tell my mother-in-law that she did not have to come feed our cat Nena while we were gone this weekend. I mean, we were only gone two days, and cats can survive for weeks without human attention. But she has a key to the house (my mother-in-law, not Nena), so we couldn't stop her. And she was shocked as Nena brought a mouse to the patio, and proceeded to eat the mouse, completely, on the spot, from head to tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother-in-law loves cats, as she remembers the kitten she had as a young girl, but has never had a cat since her childhood, and thus doesn't really understand cats at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought Nena was being quite considerate to her guest host. Usually she leaves the head for us to pick up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're back, none the worse for wear. And we noticed some huge differences between the German island of Sylt and the Danish island of R√∏m√∏. On Sylt, the beaches are heavily regulated and environmentally protected. A fee is required for parking and for entry, the beach is cleaned daily, covered beach chairs &lt;em&gt;(Strandk√∂rbe)&lt;/em&gt; are available for rent, food and drink are available for sale, and certain fringe groups (namely nudists and dogs) are given their own areas as to not disturb others. None of this applies on R√∏m√∏, where you simply drive onto the beach, unpack your gear, fire up your grill, and start cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't consider this all that seriously as evidence of the differences between Danes and Germans. For one thing, there are geographical differences... Sylt is eroding away, while R√∏m√∏ has more sq. km of sand than land. And most of those driving and grilling on the beaches of R√∏m√∏ were Germans.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What's the big deal?</title>

   <updated>2004-07-27T19:07:20+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/07/27/whats-the-big-deal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Matthew asks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001900.html&quot; title=&quot;The Silent Penguin: DNC - more than just Kerry?&quot;&gt;What's the big deal about the Democratic convention?&lt;/a&gt; &quot;I mean Kerry is set to be nominated, so that would take like half an hour. Then they could release the balloons, have a speech and be back on the road by midday.What else?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, technically the convention is like a German &lt;em&gt;Parteitag&lt;/em&gt;, with delegates voting on personel, resolutions and positions for the campaign. But in reality it's a scripted media circus... but it's an important circus nonetheless. Being able to put on a good circus is an essential quality for a president. For 4 days the Democrats have the party have the media stage to themselves and on their terms. Americans have had 4 years to form an impression of the incumbant, but only a few months to get to know the challenger. If he can't make a good impression now, he never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an American presidential election it is very difficult to defeat an incumbant. Clinton did it, Carter was a special case, otherwise you have to go back to FDR in 1932. If Kerry is to have a chance this November, he needs to put on a good convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Back in the States when I was young, I was a delegate at a couple of political conventions, but only up to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/01/19/i-have-a-voice/&quot;&gt;congressional district level&lt;/a&gt;, never state or national.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/07/22/solitary-confinement</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The past few days I've been setting up some small scale FreeBSD jails. Setting up a full scale jail is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jail&amp;amp;apropos=0&amp;amp;sektion=0&amp;amp;manpath=FreeBSD+4.10-stable&amp;amp;format=html&quot;&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt;, just run make install into some directory, and there are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://memberwebs.com/nielsen/freebsd/jails/&quot;&gt;nice tools to manage jails&lt;/a&gt; once they are running. However, a full make install weighs in at over 100 MB. Even &lt;a href=&quot;http://memberwebs.com/nielsen/freebsd/jails/docs/jail_remove.html&quot;&gt;deleting some files&lt;/a&gt; leaves 80 MB. That seemed to me to be too heavy... I want each jail to run just one service: a squid, an apache, a postfix, a mysql. I couldn't find anything on setting up a &quot;thin&quot; jail, other than the advice to &quot;delete what you don't need&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I did find &lt;a href=&quot;http://neon1.net/misc/minibsd.html&quot;&gt;MiniBSD&lt;/a&gt;, a standalone system designed to fit on a Compact Flash card. By building it, then deleting the files not needed for a jail, I ended up with 15 MB. I needed to add some things back (pam libraries, pkg tools), but then I had a tight system with sshd and the ability to install packages. To set up a new jail, I can unjust unpack my tar, set up an alias interface, and start it up. For squid or postfix I just need two packages. Apache requires a few more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to have all my network services running in its own jail, 3 or 4 jails per PC, each jail with a redundant setup on another machine. When a system goes down, I can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boutell.com/rinetd/&quot;&gt;rinetd&lt;/a&gt; to bounce the original IPs into the backup jail... no playing with firewalls or DNS tables to get back going. The host machines have no ports other than ssh open... only the jails are visible to the outside world. You may break one of my services, even gain root with it, but you're still behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>No Redemption</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/07/20/no-redemption/"/>
   <updated>2004-07-20T03:07:49+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/07/20/no-redemption</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the 60th anniversary of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_20_Plot&quot;&gt;attempt to assassinate Hitler&lt;/a&gt; on 20 July 1944. The date is well marked in Germany. The Bendlerblock, the Wehrmacht headquarters in Berlin where the conspirators were executed that same evening, has become a shrine of sorts for the present-day Bundeswehr, and the date has been marked in recent years by a ceremony for new recruits in the Bendlerblock courtyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine the date passes elsewhere almost unnoticed. Indeed, the failed coup is no more than a tragic asterisk in the history of the war. Modern Germany would desperately like to find a pinpoint of light, to grasp a shred of redemption from that absolute darkness. The German reverence of 20 July is an attempt at self-therapy, to forget all the horrors, when in fact the world will not forget the horrors carried out by Germans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plotters of 20 July were not saints or heroes, but human beings who recovered their humanity all too late. May they rest in peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billspricht.net/2004_07_18_archive.html#109035536770175063&quot;&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://expat-odyssey.blogspot.com/2004/07/who-were-true-german-heros.html&quot;&gt;Duncan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lillimarleen.blogspot.com/2004/07/july-20th-in-germany-yes-in-germany.html&quot;&gt;Lilli Marleen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://couchblog.de/webpropaganda/article/321/&quot;&gt;Webpropaganda&lt;/a&gt; on this as well. Most of them mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose&quot;&gt;Hans &amp;amp; Shophie Scholl&lt;/a&gt; as truer heroes than the plotters of 20 July. While I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/11/07/the-greatest-germans/&quot;&gt;admire&lt;/a&gt; the Scholls, I don't think the comparison is apt. The White Rose was a bold and heroic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/07/20/no-redemption/#comment-1426&quot;&gt;gesture&lt;/a&gt;, doomed to failure from the start. The Wehrmacht officers, on the other hand, were willing allies of Hitler for years before July 1944.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>As The World Churns</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have new developments in the soap opera that is my workplace. Management finally presented a concrete proposal for salary reductions (retroactive to July 1). The reductions are to be progressive (rather than a flat 15%)  and require 75% acceptance to take effect. However, the reductions are still permanent and the employees still receive nothing in return... no layoff protection, no plan for future repayment, and no business plan for the future. So I'll vote to reject the plan. If that means layoffs, even for me, then so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I've decided to stay with the company (rather than work elsewhere or go freelance) at least until the end of the year. The exception would be if a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sixapart.com/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogg.de&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt; were interested in me, but otherwise I'll wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_07/004306.php&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/07/Blog_Health_Ratios.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Kevin is talking about the US, Germany's position is also a bit of an outlier, being a bit expensive and a bit heavy on public spending. When deciding the future of health care financing in Germany, we probably should look at countries lower and to the left (France, Netherlands, Austria) for examples.&lt;/p&gt;

It's fast and very usable, but I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001874.html&quot; title=&quot;The Silent Penguin: Bloglines with new functionality&quot;&gt;wishing for the same feature as Matthew&lt;/a&gt;, namely the feeds with new entries be sorted to the top. Otherwise, if you have several hundred unread entries (like, if you went to sleep for the night), you quickly become lost and the temptation is great to Mark All Read and start over. Lo and behold, Bloglines has added just this feature, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#63&quot;&gt;and many more&lt;/a&gt;.

We were at their Sommerfest last weekend, and they had already had him registered and assigned to a room (he'll be in the 'penguin' group) and teachers. Our first parents meeting is this Thursday, when they'll explain what he needs to bring (from the looks of it, each kid has nearly a complete wardrobe of indoor and outdoor gear on hand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next surprise was at work. I told my boss that we got the kindergarten of our choice, and that starting in August I'd have to be home by 3 instead of 5. He said no problem, no need to go part time, I can make up the hours from home. That's fine as long as we have short time, that's only a couple of hours a week. When we go back to full hours, I'm not sure how things will work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My decisions would be easier if some choices were eliminated for me. If it were impossible for me to continue work, either because of kindergarten or bankruptcy, then I could always implement Plan B. But now that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; continue to work, I have to decide for myself whether I really &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to. That will be hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It's also hard to write about. We've known all this since last weekend, and it took me over a week to decide how much, and how little, to write about it.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Null Bock&lt;/em&gt; is the German phrase that describes my mood today. It literally means &quot;no goat&quot;, but in this case means I'm feeling bored and apathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on the subject of silly German phrases, it betrays my age pretty exactly to admit the first hip German word I learned was &lt;em&gt;Affentittengeil&lt;/em&gt; (literally &quot;monkey tits horny&quot;), something  I haven't heard since the early '80s. (Does that qualify me to march in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schlagermove.de/index.php?page=home&amp;amp;city=hamburg&quot;&gt;Schlager Move&lt;/a&gt; in Hamburg next weekend?)&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/06/22/converting-manila</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in April 2002, I converted my Manila weblog at editthispage.com to Movable Type using XML files exported from Manila and a simple Perl script (using XML::Twig).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month (2 weeks &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the weblogs.com outage), Susan Kitchens found my old script and asked me about converting her Manila site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2020hindsight.org&quot;&gt;http://www.2020hindsight.org&lt;/a&gt; (after she had painstakingly extracted her site into XML). I thought that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtimport.html&quot;&gt;Movable Type Import Format&lt;/a&gt; would be a good target, since it can be imported into many different weblogging systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Manila had become more complicated in the meantime, and I was unable to quickly apply my script to Susan's files (i.e. I've gotten stuck), and I'm short of time. Since a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/06/15/Archive-Restore&quot;&gt;number of people&lt;/a&gt; had publicly offered to help export Manila sites, people with a probably a better understanding of Manila and XML than I have, I decided to plea for help via a Wiki page entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/ConvertingManila&quot;&gt;ConvertingManila&lt;/a&gt;.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our new cat Nena had a unique way of celebrating Midsummer this morning. She decided she wanted to be let outside at the crack of dawn, which at our latitude was 3:30 am. She's learned that she can wake us up by rustling through the potted palm in our bedroom. Very much annoyed, I brought her downstairs, threw her outside and went back to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife, however, couldn't get back to sleep and went downstairs. She must have let Nena back in, because at some point the cat was back upstairs rustling again through the palm. This time she was clumsy, toppling the palm with 20-liter pot and potting soil onto the floor with a crash. Needless to say, the night was now ruined, as well as the day. Tonight both the palm and the cat will be set outside.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had our appointment today with the speech expert from Hannover. She approved Christopher the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/05/19/kindergarten-watch/&quot;&gt;speech therapy kindergarten&lt;/a&gt; in Winsen, which was what we wanted. The costs will be split between the county and our health insurance. Now that the plans are concrete, I can make arrangements to work part-time starting in August and maybe do some free-lancing with the extra time I'll have at home. I'm happy that I won't be forced to leave work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Christopher is making improvements in areas like vocabulary, his fluency of speech &lt;em&gt;(Redefluss)&lt;/em&gt; is still jerky, sometimes lapsing into stuttering.  It will be good for him to be in a small group of his peers. He won't be starting until fall, but the kindergarten has already invited us to their summer party this weekend. They are hoping for warm weather for water games.&lt;/p&gt;

My grandmother's maiden name was Aakvik, so it could very well be that we are related to the late Norwegian politician. Whether he had married into the royal family is yet unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

I have one (un, eins, uno) point, and it took a herioc effort by Zidane to achieve that. Yesterday, for example, I picked Italy to win and Sweden to tie.

In today's Euro-Parliament election (results presented between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euro2004.com/&quot;&gt;Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt; matches), with less than 22% the SPD has its worst national post-war result. They have less than half the vote of the Union (45%). Maybe Schr√∂der should think about buying the rights to Project 18 from the FDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find worrying is that some of those SPD voters are heading to the ex-communist PDS. Over 6% in the Europe vote, in today's state election in Thuringa over 26% (SPD just 15%).  Fifteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the former SED should by all rights be in the dustbin of history. The failed German reunification is keeping them alive.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sherpas for WordPress</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/06/13/sherpas-for-wordpress/"/>
   <updated>2004-06-13T09:06:45+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/06/13/sherpas-for-wordpress</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2004/06/11/wordpress-and-bugs/&quot;&gt;Shelley&lt;/a&gt; had a bad experience with the new WordPress bug tracker &lt;a href=&quot;http://mosquito.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;Mosquito&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://photomatt.net/archives/2004/06/11/mosquito-bites/&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; (among others) thought she was being a poor sport about it. Nonetheless, Shelley does have a good point. To be successful, WordPress has to provide support to users that is both effective and understandable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bug trackers are a subject near and dear to my heart, since maintaining them is one of my main responsibilities at work (using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mantisbt.org/&quot;&gt;Mantis&lt;/a&gt;, the same software behind Mosquito). My bug trackers at work take a relatively closed approach. The customer communicates solely with a supporter, not directly with the developers. The support is able to solve most problems on his own. If he needs help, his communication with the developers in the tracker are flagged as &quot;private&quot;, and are invisible to the customer. We thus use Mantis as both a support tool and a development tool, but the two functions are kept separate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supporter is the main link in the process. He acts as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa&quot;&gt;sherpa&lt;/a&gt; between the customer and the developers, and decides whether the issue is a customer-side problem that he can help the customer solve, or a software problem that requires a developer (or a feature request that needs to be negotiated into the software spec). The customer doesn't really care what kind of problem he has, he simply wants it solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if this model can be applied to an open source project. Sherpas for open source are few and far between. But without them, an open-to-all bug tracker can disintegrate into chaos. Support for WordPress is probably best given in a forum rather than a bug tracker, with real people and plain language. Technical projects like Samba or FreeBSD can take a 'apply the diff and see if it works' approach, but WordPress probably needs to act a little more commercial to serve its users well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The German Consitutional Court today ruled that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1431_A_1231041_1_A,00.html&quot; title=&quot;High Court Rejects Liberalizing Store Hours | Business &amp;amp; Economics | Deutsche Welle | 09.06.2004&quot;&gt;the national store closing law is not unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;. So one of the more annoying peculiarities of German life won't be disappearing just yet. But it will probably better if the law is done away with by lawmakers in Berlin rather than a court ruling in Karlsruhe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An argument by unions for keeping the law is the protection of retail workers, although I have no idea why they deserve more protection than public safety, health care, or restaurant workers who work on evenings and Sundays. If Germany had a functioning and flexible labor market, retail workers would be easily be able to find jobs that match their private schedule. But if Germany had a functioning and flexible labor market, the country would have a lot less problems period.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I first was aware of politics when I was 5 years old. I knew a few basic facts. The president was Lyndon Johnson, there was a war in Vietnam, and the governor was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/05/politics/05WIRE-REAGAN.html?ex=1401854400&amp;amp;en=6e15cdfead6e276b&amp;amp;ei=5007&amp;amp;partner=USERLAND&quot; title=&quot;The New York Times &amp;gt; Washington &amp;gt; Reagan Had Long Struggle With Alzheimer's Disease&quot;&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;. My dad worked for the state of California, so Ronald Reagan was his boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing not mentioned in the NYT obituary: Reagan's election as governor in 1966 sparked the first campus protests at UC Berkeley, and thus the entire student protest movement of the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a college freshman in 1980, my first and only experience as a real journalist was covering the state  Republican election party for student radio. Carter conceeded before we reached the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I saw him once, as a blurry shadow in a speeding limo. He was in Minneapolis for a fundraiser. I was in demonstration protesting against something or other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a kind and gentle man whose policies made America less kind and less gentle. I do think he helped to end the Cold War, but not through harsh threats and weapons programs, but through his human friendship with a man named Gorbachev.&lt;/p&gt;

And now I've done it. My tagline is now a random Helden lyric. The script is literally 3 lines of PHP (stolen from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cafelog/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/hello.php?rev=1.3&amp;amp;view=auto&quot;&gt;Hello Dolly plugin &lt;/a&gt;in WordPress), so I won't bother to repeat it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 27 Sep 2004&lt;/strong&gt; I've switched musical directions.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you've been following the soap opera that is my workplace, be assured that all is not peaches and cream. Yes, the company has found an investor, a venture capital fund rather than a competitor, so our existance is ensured for the short term and entire departments will not be rationalized away. But the investors are expecting further cost-cutting, which means management will be proposing a salary reduction package in the next few days. However, we've been in cost-cutting mode for over 3 years now, a mode that is very tiresome, and whatever trust the employees had in management is long gone. Noone is in the mood to give up anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the investor has a share in some 30 other high-tech companies, some of whom might be interested in our software. It might be good to extend away from the banking industry, which is notoriously tight-fisted and slow-paying.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use sanitized titles as legible permalinks when I converted to WordPress, so I was somewhat dismayed on my first trial run when all the umlauts (√§,√∂,√º) were thrown out. That is, a post entitled &quot;Schr√∂der Sucks&quot; was encoded as schrder-sucks, which isn't legible at all. I went browsing through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cafelog/wordpress/&quot;&gt;WordPress CVS repository&lt;/a&gt;, and found that code for converting (rather than dropping) high-ASCII characters had been &lt;a href=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/cafelog/wordpress/wp-includes/functions-formatting.php?r1=text&amp;amp;tr1=1.29&amp;amp;r2=text&amp;amp;tr2=1.31&amp;amp;diff_format=h&quot;&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; after 1.2 was released. I copied the code into a plugin, and ended up with schroder-sucks, which is almost correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In German, the convention is to transliterate umlauts into two letters (√§=ae, √∂=oe, √º=ue). The CVS code has some two-character conversions, so I added the umlauts to that list in my plugin, and the result was schroeder-sucks, which is just what I wanted.  I've saved the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.wordpress.org/GermanPermalinks&quot;&gt;German Permalinks plugin&lt;/a&gt; at the WordPress Wiki. Note that to import correctly, the plugin needs to be installed and activated &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the import.&lt;/p&gt;

If I were, I'd probably be a programmer. As it stands, if I can find tools that work, I won't write code. (If) I have no choice... I at least want to write very little code.&quot; True.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Despite missing most of last week at work, I apparently didn't miss much. There is still no official word on whether we have avoided insolvency or not. There are all sorts of rumors, ranging from the company will declare insolvency but continue in its present form to  we will be bought out and absorbed into an existing firm. A persistent rumor is that systems administration will be completely out-sourced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do know for sure is that 1) the May salaries are late, and 2) short-time &lt;em&gt;(Kurzarbeit)&lt;/em&gt; has been extended another 6 months until November. So someone is planning at least for the short-term future. And the stock price been going up (to 70 cents from 30 cents last week), so somebody might know something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Oh, and my knee is doing better. It still hurts, but it's now a tired kind of hurt, and I've put the crutches away. After returning to work yesterday, I now realize just how many stairs there are in the Hamburg U- and S-Bahn system. I feel each and every one of them.)&lt;/p&gt;

When I hurt my leg the other day, I was able to leave work early. It doesn't count against any time off or anything, and nothing gets docked off my pay. And when I went to the specialist to have it checked, it doesn't really matter to me whether workers comp covers it or not, because either way I don't pay. And when the doctor recommends that I rest the leg for a couple of days, that means I get the time off work, paid. And even if the company goes bankrupt and I lose my job, I do not lose my health coverage. I don't have to pay an arm and a leg for health care. That's how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm just wondering, is there any political data to either back this up or refute this?  My gut feeling is that this is not directly true, as Stoiber did not present a clear alternative on Iraq (in fact, in the end, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/09/19/1887.php&quot;&gt;he was even more anti-war than Schr√∂der&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;1. Stumble on steps at S-Bahn station Sternschanze on the way to work and twist knee. Do not notice pain at first. When at noon walking becomes extremely uncomfortable, go home. Find that family doctor has no office hours this afternoon. Go to pharmacy and buy strongest non-prescription pain pills available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Update:** My neighbor the physical therapist says that the fibula *(Wadenbein)* is way too flexible at the knee, and suspects a severe strain or a minor tear. She suggests I visit an orthopedist first thing in the morning. And since this was legally a work accident, I get to become acquainted with German workers' comp bureaucracy. Oh, joy!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;WordPress&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; (which has now released 1.2) with its filtering capability makes it real easy to solve one of my formatting quirks, namely that I want my titles and permalinks inline with the content of each post, i.e. within the p-tags that are automatically inserted around the post. With MT I had to install a regex plugin to force in my strings. With WordPress, I define a simple filter, and by setting a priority, that filter is applied _before_ any tags are added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really as simple as this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;function foo_content_bar($text) {&lt;br /&gt;
  return 'foo'.$text.'bar';&lt;br /&gt;
}&lt;br /&gt;
add_filter('the_content','foo_content_bar',1);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hans Filbinger, CDU, was a military judge for the Nazis, and in 1978 resigned as premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg state when his past came to light. At the time he was quoted as saying &quot;what was right then cannot be wrong now&quot;. The thing is, this is the &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; time Filbinger has served on the assembly since his resignation. So it was OK in the '90s for ex-Nazi judges to choose the president, and suddenly &lt;a title=&quot;Wenn ich Kandidat f√ºr das Amt des Bundespr√§sidenten w√§re...

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been playing a bit more with WordPress (for which there is a &lt;a title=&quot;WordPress Development Blog&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/development/archives/2004/05/20/final-release-candidate/&quot;&gt;new release candidate&lt;/a&gt; since yesterday), and I'm reminded of what I didn't like about it back when it was b2, and what I don't like about Movable Type. With WordPress, if you want to do anything slightly different from  what it intends (for example, customizing the text of the monthly archive links, or listing the 5 latest comments), you end up writing a hack, essentially rewriting one of its PHP functions to do what you want. But PHP is at least logical and well-documented. Movable Type has it's own well-documented but esoteric template language, for which you can find plugins to make it even more esoteric, with which you can do most but not all of what you want. I have about a dozen plugins installed, but I've forgotten which ones I really use. I can do Perl, I've done Perl for 10 years, but it's simple sysadmin baby-talk Perl, not elegant Perl like Ben and Mena. So I'm stumped by something simple like 'put all my post titles inline with the post content, except when an image comes at the beginning of the post content'. There's probably a way to do that with CSS, but I can't do CSS very well either.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher had a busy day yesterday. Not only did he have his hearing checked (which he happily demonstrated on me last evening with his doctor kit: 'Now the big bear and the little mouse are running in your ear!'). He also checked out the speech therapy kindergarten in Winsen. He loved it. The groups are very small (9 children), they have a great gym, and best of all, a huge toy helicopter. The amount of actual therapy (twice a week) is the same as the local integration group. The director talked with him for over an hour and thought he'd he an excellent candidate for the group. She found it very good that he listens and responds to corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group would also work well for his parents. The hours are 8:30 to 14:30, with transport provided (Winsen is 30 km from here). The place would be guaranteed for one year, with possible extensions after that. That's a schedule that we can plan around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final diagnosis will be on June 17, when we have an appointment with the county health department. After that we'll be able to make some decisions for both Christopher and Papa.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Love and Money</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(I've been corresponding with Heiko Hebig, who represents TypePad and Movable Type in Germany, about the new MT license.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Heiko,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free version would be enough for PapaScott, but I'd already donated twice over the past couple of years and was looking forward to the Pro version. At any rate, on the first day already I cashed in my keys and purchased a personal license, as my way of saying thanks for the past 2 years of great software. Now 6A and I are quid, they don't owe me anything anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I were to recommend MT to an small to mid-sized organization, $199 is a pretty steep entry price, especially if they aren't yet convinced that weblogs are a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea would be to drop the distinction between personal and commercial use, keep the unsupported free version as it is, charge $29 per blog for the supported version, with volume discounts starting with the 6th blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I won't be dropping MT because I object to the license. I have been playing around with WordPress because I find the technology interesting, and especially contrasting the static-build of MT vs. the dynamic approaches. I also find the idea of seamlessly switching backends intriguing. (MT on even-numbered days, WordPress on odd-numbered days, and Blosxom on Sundays?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all about love and money. You need both.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MT to WordPress</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/05/16/mt-to-wordpress/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some notes on importing MT entries into WordPress: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The script in the WP RC uses the MT export file, so post numbers are not imported. That might be important if you use the post number in your permalink, like I do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MT 3.0 seems to have a bug in the export routine... the dates are missing an AM/PM designation, so all posts and comments posted between noon and midnight are off by 12 hours. MT 2.661 exports from an MT 3.0 database just fine, though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default encoding of WP is UTF-8, so you either have to convert the MT export file from Latin 1 to UTF-8 (either recode or BBEdit works fine), or change the encoding in WP (under Options-&amp;gt;Reading) to ISO 8859-1.&lt;/li&gt;

A bit overpriced, I would say. If I were to introduce weblogs into my company's intranet (100 employees), it would be cheaper to install a Notes server (&lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; hardware and much more functionality) than to license MT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy, though, reminds me of when Userland Frontier went commercial in the late '90s. A great product, an active developer community... but when it was no longer free, the community disintegrated. I hope that Six Apart is paying attention, and will rethink its pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a title=&quot;Davids Medienkritik&quot; href=&quot;http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Davids Medienkritik&lt;/a&gt; did just post a &lt;a title=&quot;Davids Medienkritik: We Need Your Help!&quot; href=&quot;http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/we_need_your_he.html&quot;&gt;plea to help translate&lt;/a&gt; posts into English, and I'll be helping out now and again (once a week or so). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, espcially considering that David's views are, um, somewhat to the right of mine? Because it's a good blog, and it starts good conversations. Even if Germans and Americans tend to disagree, at Medienkritik they're at least talking to one another. As a bilingual expat, one thing I can offer to the community is to translate things that are interesting, and David's points are always interesting and worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation is hard work and I am by no means a profressional translator, but at least the &lt;a title=&quot;Davids Medienkritik: Bush's Down ... Oops, He's Up! / Bush sinkt ... Hoppla, er steigt!&quot; href=&quot;http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/bushs_down_oops.html&quot;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; was fun.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed while on vacation was how utterly useless &lt;a title=&quot;SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/&quot;&gt;Spiegel Online&lt;/a&gt; is for keeping up with German news. Take this evening, for example. Of the 5 'Top Stories', 3 are on the US and Iraq (if I want to read Bush-bashing, I'll go closer to the source), 1 is about sports (Oliver Kahn), and 1 about German news (Finance Minister Eichel). Even under 'Politics' there is little serious domestic news (2 of 7 stories; taxing brothels does not qualify as serious). While other &lt;a title=&quot;Davids Medienkritik&quot; href=&quot;http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; complain about alleged bias in the German media, I would be happy if the premier German news site simply could be somewhat more &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're now a month into the process of registering Christopher for kindergarten, and we are more confused than ever. As you recall, he is behind in his speech development, and it has been recommended to us several times that he not join a regular kindergarten group. There is a local 'integrated' group that includes sessions of speech therapy each week, and there is a 'therapy' group in the county seat Winsen (over 30 km away) that is intensive speech therapy. However, our speech therapist today told us to choose carefully... that the therapy group does not necessarily include more therapy than an integrated group. In any case, the diagnosis has to be confirmed by the county health office, and our appointment there is not until June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either group will be half-days, and will not be compatible with 2 full time working parents. I've informed my employer of the situation, and that I'll be either requesting part-time or leaving completely (and going freelance), but until we have more details, I can't make any decision.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the first desktop news aggregator I've tried that makes me feel like I want to keep using it. But it's still just a desktop aggregator... I can't use it at work, and it only works when the machine is turned on and connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which got me thinking... wouldn't it be nice if news readers worked like IMAP mail clients? A server could collect the feeds and keep track of which items had been read, and I could use whatever reader I want from whatever machine I want. Just a thought...&lt;/p&gt;

However, I didn't read the fine print, which requires that I set up a Music Store account to redeem the card. Since I don't have a US credit card, and I'm too old to ask my mother to use hers, I was unable to use the card. Anyone want to buy it, payment via PayPal? Send me a mail, make me an offer I can't refuse (over $14).&lt;/p&gt;

A reporter is interviewing a German housewife who, with the permission of her husband, has learned yodeling at night school, including the conjugation of yodel verbs (&quot;Di dudl di?&quot; &quot;Nein, di dudl d√∂!&quot;), so she can earn a degree and have something she can call her own. Something in the hand. A yodel diploma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My career in Germany as a systems administrator is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; yodel diploma. We came here for my wife's career. We knew she'd be successful here, and her success has exceeded our wildest expectations. My accomplishment here has been to establish my own career, independent of my wife and independent of being an American. I learned Linux and Unix by myself, without any schooling, and now I can earn a living administrating Linux and Unix machines. It's something I can call my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I'm a bit attached to my job, even if we don't need the money, and I'm not entirely willing to give it up for Christopher's special kindergarten group. There a surplus of IT workers, the economy is flat,  I'm over 40 and don't have a relevent degree. Would I be able to find similar employment after Christopher is out of kindergarten and in school in two years? Maybe it's selfish, in fact, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it's selfish, but I don't really want to give up the one thing I've earned on my own in Germany. I don't want to give up my Jodeldiplom.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've been looking into Kindergarten the past couple of weeks, which we want Christopher to start this fall.

Mama and Christopher were there on Tuesday, and they both loved it. We'd also most likely be able to have a doctor certify that Christopher needs the integration group, so that the county would cover all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem. The integration group is only half-day, afternoons, 12:30-17:30, here in Jesteburg. We both work full-time in Hamburg, an hours' commute away. Do the math. Our Tagesmutter is in Buchholz, 15 minutes away, so arranging transport from there is not feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, right now if you were to ask whether my job is worth making all the arrangements for Christopher to attend this Kindergarten while I work 8 hours in Hamburg, I would truthfully have to say no.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Samba 3... yes!</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It worked! :-) At least 95% worked, and the few problems could be easily fixed. Two notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. We decided to skip domain mapping, since we don't have a group for all Samba users, and Samba 3 only maps one-to-one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. To convert the SIDs, I exported the smbpasswd to XML, added line breaks, ran this perl script, and imported into samtdb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
    #!/usr/bin/perl&lt;br /&gt;
    while (&amp;lt;&amp;gt;) {&lt;br /&gt;
        if (/sid=/) {&lt;br /&gt;
                /-(d+)&quot;/;&lt;br /&gt;
                my $oldrid=$1;&lt;br /&gt;

Here in Germany, for example, the union Ver.di is campaigning against &lt;a title=&quot;FTD - Verdi bezichtigt Aldi, Lidl und Schlecker der Mitarbeiterschikane&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ftd.de/ub/di/1070545777251.html?nv=rs&quot;&gt;labor practices at the Aldi and Lidl chains&lt;/a&gt;. Shaving pay is theft of the worst kind, from those who can least afford the loss. We've experienced first hand that it is possible to start from minimum wage and rise to run (a good share of) the company, and have seen people fired for the practices described in the article. These managers and supervisors are not only cheating the people resonsible for their success, they are betraying the economic system that makes their success possible, and those of us who believe in that system. The free market only works when people are rewarded for their talents and their efforts. Deny them what they are due, and the system will rot. It is extremely important for supervisors not to rely solely on their managers, but to talk to their employees, and make sure they are happy and getting what they have earned.&lt;/p&gt;

Samba calculates the SID for each user dynamically, and samba-tng uses a different formula than samba 3. For users to continue to work after switching to samba 3, their SIDs must be explicitly set to the old values. Since smbpasswd does not store SIDS, the user information has to be stored in a database, preferably ldap, but for our small network tdbsam will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost as an aside, I also &lt;a title=&quot;[Samba] Re: Group mapping: several unix groups to one Windows group?&quot; href=&quot;http://lists.samba.org/archive/samba/2004-April/083765.html&quot;&gt;found out&lt;/a&gt; that I was mapping the unix groups incorrectly. So will the switch to samba 3 now work? We can test ahead of time, but we will only know for sure when we go live.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Subsidized Day Care</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/04/01/subsidized-day-care/"/>
   <updated>2004-04-01T03:04:17+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/04/01/subsidized-day-care</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend when doing income taxes, I was surprised to learn that  the German government is now paying 25% of our day care costs. As of 2003, child care costs are generally tax deductable, and since we pay our Tagesmutter 600 Euros per month, that's not a small amount added to our tax refund. Thank you, Chancellor Schr√∂der.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we're in a high tax bracket and could afford day care even without the deduction. For a low or middle class family who actually needs the help, the subsidy is much less, which I don't think was exactly what Red/Green had in mind. Child care is subsidized for the rich, while the government kindergarten system, which is supposed to guarantee a place for all pre-school children, is underfunded and fails to provide places for 200,000 children. (The &lt;a title=&quot;Kita-Reform :: Mehr Zeit f√ºr Kinder | Hamburger Initiative f√ºr mehr Kindergartenpl√§tze&quot; href=&quot;http://www.kita-reform.de/&quot;&gt;failed voucher system in Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; is an extreme example. The Abendblatt recently reported on a &lt;a title=&quot;Sozialhilfe statt Arbeit: Nur dann gibts einen Kita-Gutschein&quot; href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2004/03/20/275489.html&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; where an unemployed mother was unable to accept employment because she would then lose her kindergarten voucher. Child care only if you don't need it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is also kind enough to subsidize my daily commute to work, which is expensive because of high gas taxes and because I choose to live outside the city. Since the deduction is a flat rate per kilometer based on a mid-sized car, I actually make money on the deduction by driving a small car or taking the train. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the thing with a high, progressive income tax with a lot of loopholes. The deductions are then &lt;em&gt;degressive&lt;/em&gt;, benefitting the rich more than the poor. At high tax brackets, it becomes more lucrative to expend effort to find tax loopholes than to actually be productive and increase one's income (and expand the economy and create jobs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the parties have been talking about reforming the income tax by lowering rates and removing loopholes, but they aren't doing much about it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At work I inherited an installation of &lt;a title=&quot;Samba-TNG&quot; href=&quot;http://www.samba-tng.org/&quot;&gt;Samba-TNG&lt;/a&gt;. We want to eventually migrate to  &lt;a title=&quot;SAMBA Web Pages&quot; href=&quot;http://www.samba.org/&quot;&gt;Samba 3&lt;/a&gt;, which my predecessor warned me would be really hard. I didn't really believe him, mostly out of ignorance, since I have absolutely no clue how Windows networking works. Samba-TNG has been acting up the past few weeks, destroying user profiles and refusing to play with Win2K SP4, so when my boss asked about Samba 3, I foolishly said yes, let's do it. I set up a test domain, and was able to log on, mount volumes, and print. So we decided to go live with Samba 3. I could log on, mount volumes and print, but the real Windows users were having tons of problems. So we bailed out and went back to TNG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had copied over the smbpasswd, the domain SID, and the group map. I guess that's not enough. It looks like I need to copy over machine SIDs (or are they RIDs?), and I haven't a clue how to do that. On Google I can't find anything about 'migrating from samba tng to samba 3'. So for now I'm stuck. Sometimes I'm as dumb as I think I am.&lt;/p&gt;

Since the geeky computer stuff doesn't have much to do with the other stuff, and my mother doesn't really want to read the geeky stuff, I'm going to try putting it on a separate page called &lt;a title=&quot;Posts not intended for my mother&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/tech.php&quot;&gt;PapaTech&lt;/a&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown&quot; title=&quot;by John Gruber&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; is a syntax for converting plain text to (X)HTML. It's written in Perl and available (among other things) as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org&quot; title=&quot;Movable Type&quot;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt; plugin. I'm trying it out with this post. It's designed to leave the plain text very readable after it's marked up, as opposed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/&quot; title=&quot;by Dean Allen&quot;&gt;Textile&lt;/a&gt;, which makes marking up plain text easy but is leaves the plain text less than readable. Markdown might come in handy for text maintained by less web-savvy colleagues, or for quickly marking up text from web-unfriendly sources (like Microsoft Word). I'll try it out for a few posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The MTEntry tag &lt;code&gt;convert_breaks&lt;/code&gt; seems to be incompatible with Markdown. I've removed it from my templates for now, and if I keep using Markdown I'll figure out another way to get my entry title and my permalink on the same line as the entry body.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a title=&quot;Little Jamie - Everything counts in large amounts&quot; href=&quot;http://www.littlejamie.com/entry.php?id=592&quot;&gt;Little Jamie&lt;/a&gt;, I've recently joined the 21st century and bought an &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.mediamarkt.de/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=32401&amp;amp;catalogId=5000&amp;amp;langId=-3&amp;amp;storeId=5000&amp;amp;categoryId=11001&quot;&gt;mp3 stick&lt;/a&gt;, 256 MB USB. So now I can tune out whereever I am. My current favorite is the debut album &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon.de: Musik: Die Reklamation [ENHANCED]&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009WW5B&quot;&gt;Die Reklamation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a title=&quot;WIR SIND HELDEN&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wirsindhelden.com/&quot;&gt;Wir Sind Helden&lt;/a&gt;, who lately swept the Echos (the German Grammies). They're '80s-retro NDW with clever modern German lyrics. I mention them here for non-native German speakers.... they do some fun things with the language, and you might enjoy listening to them just for that, even if you're not into post-modern anti-consumerism (with a fetish for sledge hammers?). They offer a &lt;a title=&quot;GUTEN TAG (Die Reklamation)&quot; href=&quot;http://helden.warenform.de/swf/GutenRMX.mp3&quot;&gt;kitschy remix of &lt;em&gt;Guten Tag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (MP3, 4MB) on their website with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wirsindhelden.com/html/guten1.html&quot;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt; to follow along. My favorite song, though, is the quieter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wirsindhelden.com/html/denkmal1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denkmal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whose chorus can be slightly edited into a slogan for webloggers: &lt;em&gt;Ich werd die schlechtesten Blogger dieser Stadt engagiern, Die sollen nachts noch die Tr√ºmmer mit Parolen beschmiern&lt;/em&gt; (I'll hire the worst bloggers in the city, tonight they will paint slogans on the ruins).&lt;/p&gt;

These latter reactions are wholly inappropriate. Spain is not America, but it is an ally, and a representative democracy. It is not our place to criticize whom our allies select to be their leaders, so long as the elections are free and fair, and democracy is not undermined. The people of Spain have spoken, and the rest of us must respect their decision. Aznar had been a steadfast supporter of the United States and President Bush during a very trying time in our history. For his loyalty, he deserves our undying gratitude. Muchas gracias, Se√±or Aznar.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Another fine moment in systems administration</title>

   <updated>2004-03-15T17:03:32+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/03/15/another-fine-moment-in-systems-administration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A month ago I replaced the system on a monitoring server, a low-powered PC that stores our syslogs and runs &lt;a title=&quot;A high performance, extremely flexible system for monitoring trends in time-series data.&quot; href=&quot;http://cricket.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt;, collecting various statistics via SNMP. It also serves as the serial console for most of our Suns, so the machine has to stay up and usable. Over the past couple of weeks performance had degraded steadily. Rebooting would solve the problem at first, but within an hour the load would again be maxxed out, even though the CPU was mostly idle and no RAM was being swapped. I installed a new kernel. I replaced the network card (which was spewing errors). I tried stopping services. I turned off the software RAID. Nothing helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally today I stumbled upon the answer. The mail logs from our postfix servers were not being rotated. We had customized syslog to save the mail logs with non-standard names, and my predecessor had put the logrotate configuration for the custom log files not where I'd expect, in /etc/logrotate.conf (which I had copied over from the old system), but in a file named 'guenther' (name changed to protext the guilty) under /etc/logrotate.d/. Cricket was performing a number of greps every 5 minutes on that log file, which by now was at over 200 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copied over the file, renamed it guenther_&lt;a title=&quot;LEO Results for 'bl√∂dmann'&quot; href=&quot;http://dict.leo.org/?search=bl%F6dmann&quot;&gt;bloedmann&lt;/a&gt;, ran a manual logrotate, and everything now seems fine.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm glad I'm not a Spanish voter. With the tragedy in Madrid just days before todays election, the facts are still unclear, and and least from here it seems both main parties were trying to twist the facts to their advantage. The voters thought the ruling conservatives went too far, and despite leading the polls they &lt;a title=&quot;BBC NEWS | Europe | Spanish government admits defeat&quot; href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3511280.stm&quot;&gt;appear to have lost&lt;/a&gt;, with a large voter turnout. And Aznar bows out not so gracefully, handing power to the leftist oppostition rather than his designated successor. The message of the voters is not one of weakness in the face of terror, but rather an insistance that any government deal honestly with its citizens in time of crisis. Voters by definition are always right. Do not lie to them, they do not take deception lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

To paraphrase for todays events... this was not 190 people being killed, it was 1 person being killed, 1 person with home, family, friends, 1 person being killed.... 190 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I realize that it is necessary to find those responsible, be they from the ETA or al Qaeda, but on the other hand I find the speculation on which group is responsible to be somewhat cynical. Does it really matter to the victims for which supposed cause they were killed? Doesn't the attention given to the perpetrators and their motives give them a false legitimacy and encourage similar attacks in the future? At this moment, I would rather think of the father and husband who, unlike me, was not able to step off the train and onto the platform at 7:40 this morning, than about the twisted reasoning and motives of those who killed him.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was Friday afternoon, it had been a hard week, and all I wanted to do was go home. But no trains were running southbound from Hamburg. The tracks had been closed &quot;due to a &lt;em&gt;betriebsfremde&lt;/em&gt; person on the tracks&quot;, meaning a non-rail employee. And this during Friday rush hour. The platform filled with waiting passengers for the next 30 minutes, then the tracks were cleared and the trains started running again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following Monday morning, it was cold and I was running late. I arrived at our commuter station, but no trains were running. The tracks to Hamburg were blocked for an unexplained reason, so the local train wasn't running at all, and the regional had to take a roundabout route and was running late. So I ran late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later heard from our &lt;em&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/em&gt; that the daughter of her cleaning lady had thrown herself in front of a train that morning. I then realized what the station announcer had meant by a &quot;&lt;em&gt;betriebsfremde&lt;/em&gt; person on the tracks&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cleaning lady was someone I had exchanged pleasantries with on Thursday afternoons. Hello, how are you, I'm here to pick up my son. She's black, I assume from Ghana, I assume with unclear immigration status. An asylum seeker, mayber? She seemed happy. I never gave her a second thought. I never stopped to think that she might have children, or a daughter who was unhappy, so unhappy that she saw no future except in front of a speeding train. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wasn't there last Thursday afternoon. If I ever see her again, I won't know what to say to her.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/03/04/president-koehler</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To loosely paraphrase Helmut Kohl, politics is like making sausage. It doesn't matter what goes in, what matters is what comes out. And for the three opposition parties in Germany, who together have a majority to determine the new German &lt;em&gt;Bundespresident&lt;/em&gt; in May, the process of grinding out a   common candidate has been very messy indeed. That common candidate is the current head of the International Monetary Fund &lt;a title=&quot;IMF Chairman Resigns (washingtonpost.com)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30514-2004Mar4.html&quot;&gt;Horst K√∂hler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office of &lt;em&gt;Bundespresident&lt;/em&gt; is for the most part ceremonial and non-political, but the election every 5 years of the president by a convention of the federal Bundestag and the state parliments is highly political. This year has been more political than usual, with the rivarly between CDU and CSU, and the current weakness of the FDP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany has been lucky with its presidents. The first presidents I experienced, von Wiezsacker and Herzog, were eloquent spokesmen for Germany, its history, and its place in the world. Unfortunately, the SPD opted for an active poltician when it had its say in 1999. While Johannes Rau has been a good president, he has not lived up to his predecessors. He is unable to rise far enough above the poltical fray to exert moral authority, the only authority the office affords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first choice of the Union parties, Wolfgang Sch√§uble, is also an active poltician, and would have had the same weaknesses as Rau. Therefore I am pleased that the selection has gone to a non-politician. I know little about K√∂hler, except that he served under Kohl, and has been a capable IMF director. Knowledge of global finance can certainly be an asset for a Germany searching for the proper role in the global economy and political order. And now the politcians who chose him can return to their daily business, producing sausage. What matters is what comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Coincidentally, sausage-maker Kohl today presented the first volume of his &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon.de: B√ºcher: Erinnerungen&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3426272180/qid=1078437363/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/028-5204065-7104530&quot;&gt;memoirs&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A while ago I &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2004/01/13/2800.php&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; Mark Twain's famous comment that &quot;in German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has&quot;. (Linguistically speaking, of course. I have no idea what turnips do under cover of darkness.)  Today at messy-78's &lt;a title=&quot;Steve Minutillo :: messy-78 :: Chinese Word of the Day&quot; href=&quot;http://minutillo.com/steve/weblog/category/chinese-word-of-the-day/&quot;&gt;Chinese Word of the Day&lt;/a&gt;, I learned that with &lt;a title=&quot;Steve Minutillo :: messy-78 :: Ta1 - He, Him, She, Her&quot; href=&quot;http://minutillo.com/steve/weblog/2004/3/3/20182&quot;&gt;Chinese pronouns&lt;/a&gt;, noone has sex. Not turnips, not young girls, noone. Steve says that this is hard for English speakers to parse, since they calling my sister 'he&quot; makes us pause, just the same as calling the girl &quot;it&quot; in German still makes me pause. I would guess that German speakers would have an easier time with Chinese than English speakers, for whom (linguistic) sex is confined to people and ships.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Meaning of Hamburg</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/03/01/the-meaning-of-hamburg/"/>
   <updated>2004-03-01T05:03:17+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/03/01/the-meaning-of-hamburg</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've now slept on the Hamburg election. Despite the &lt;a title=&quot;Davids Medienkritik: German Socialists Suffer Crushing Election Loss in Hamburg&quot; href=&quot;http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/german_socialis.html&quot;&gt;glee&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a title=&quot;Instapundit.com:&quot; href=&quot;http://www.instapundit.com/archives/014406.php&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; commentators over yet another defeat for Chancellor Schr√∂der, they're missing the real meaning of the election in Hamburg... a victory for Angela Merkel, and the emergence of a new star in the CDU, Ole von Beust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure of the FDP to reach 5% reduces their weight for the selection of the Bundespresident, and Guido must now realize that unless he finally puts his yellow house in order, the CDU can do the same thing nationally as it has done in Hamburg: rule without the FDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ole von Beust is now free of the two skeletons in the closet, his homosexuality and Ronald Schill. He is now free to play a national role in the CDU. By 'pulling a Stoiber' in Hamburg, von Beust must now be mentioned in the same breath as CDU stars like Koch and Wulff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a new moderate CDU star strengthens Merkel's hand against the Lederhosen wing of the Union. I doubt that Stoiber will throw in the towel and move to Bellevue (i.e. accept the office of Bundespresident, removing him from political influence), but I do believe that the Union will take more moderate positions on issues like immigration and tax reform, and that this makes Merkel even more likely to be the next chancellor candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Lightly ediited from a comment posted at &lt;a title=&quot;Davids Medienkritik: German Socialists Suffer Crushing Election Loss in Hamburg&quot; href=&quot;http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/02/german_socialis.html&quot;&gt;Medienkritik&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since when is Schr√∂der known for his sense of humor? Did he memorize some jokes on the plane to Washington, or what? &quot;Did you hear the one about the German electronic road toll... &quot;&lt;/p&gt;

It's the first time I've heard of such telemarketing techniques in a German election campaign, and I imagine most voters were confused or angered by the calls.  But Judge Merciless needs the help... polls put his new party well under the 5% it needs to enter the Hamburg parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm taking the train to work, I have time to read things like &lt;a title=&quot;Die Zeit 09 / 2004 - Hamann/Perger: Die Angst-Macher&quot; href=&quot;http://www.zeit.de/2004/09/03_Populismus&quot;&gt;an article on populism and the Bild newspaper&lt;/a&gt; in Die Zeit. It makes a number of good points. Bild is now the most important media outlet &lt;em&gt;(Leitmedium)&lt;/em&gt; in Germany, having replaced Der Spiegel. True... if I were to imagine a federal minister today ordering a police raid of a newsroom, &lt;a title=&quot;Spiegel scandal - Wikipedia&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegel_scandal&quot;&gt;√† la Franz-Josef Strauss&lt;/a&gt;, it would be at Bild, not Spiegel. Bild's editorial line (against health reform and pension reform) reflects to a large degree its older, lower-income readership, a clientele it shares with the SPD. But while the paper can strengthen trends, it cannot set them. It was unable to elect Stoiber, who it heavily supported in 2002. In the end the paper, whose circulation of 3.8 million is at a long-time low, is not trying to set a political agenda, but trying to cement its readership by playing on its fear of reform.&lt;/p&gt;

And the Democrats have already begun to gnash their teeth. Didn't Nader cost them the last election? Since I voted for Nader in 2000, I can answer that with no. To think otherwise is to believe that voters are dumb. They are not. My vote was actually not &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; Nader, but &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; Gore, whom in 2000 I saw &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Vision Thing&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2000/11/04/1361.php&quot;&gt;no reason&lt;/a&gt; to support, nothing to distinguish him from the other candidate. If Nader weren't on the ballot, I would have voted for another 3rd candidate, or for nobody at all. Things are different now. Bush is a known quantity, we know what we have if he is re-elected. Distinguishing the two major candidates is not going to be a problem this year. So let Nader run. I won't be voting for him, and he won't make any difference.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today concludes a 4 week period in which Mama was out of town 11 out of 20 working days, 12 if you count a day when her boss was in town and she was home only in body and not in spirit. Usually she's gone just 2 or 3 days each month. I find just a day or two of playing single parent to be exhausting... I wonder how those who are single parents 24/7 have any energy at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only good thing to some out of this stretch is that I've rediscovered commuting by train. A &lt;a title=&quot;metronom - Pendeln im Takt&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dermetronom.de/&quot;&gt;new operator&lt;/a&gt; has taken over the line between Bremen and Hamburg, and as opposed to my experience with the Deutsche Bahn a couple of years ago, the new trains are comfortable, have ample seating, and run on time. And the monthly ticket is cheaper than the cost of gas, not to mention maintenance and wear and tear on the car... and the parking tickets, since the legal parking places near my office are gone by 8 am.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Linux rc scripts and lockfiles</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/02/18/linux-rc-scripts-and-lockfiles/"/>
   <updated>2004-02-18T19:02:30+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/02/18/linux-rc-scripts-and-lockfiles</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I powered down one of our Notes servers running Linux last month to replace a bad drive in the RAID, I noticed that Notes was not powered down cleanly, even though we the stop script correctly set up under /etc/rc.d. Our Notes admins have various log rotation and safety commands in their server scripts, so they very much prefer that the server be powered down correctly. I couldn't for the life of me figure out what was wrong. The server started just fine on power up, calling the script on the command line worked just fine, but doing an actual shutdown seem to skip over the stop script completely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I'm now setting up a new Notes server, and took the chance to figure out what's going wrong before it goes online. After about 20 tries, I finally saw the light. We had copied the start/stop script from a Solaris machine. It simply called &quot;server start&quot;, &quot;sever stop&quot;, or &quot;server kill&quot;. Linux (at least Mandrake and Red Hat), however, keep lock files for their services under /var/lock/subsys. When /etc/rc.d/rc is called for a change in run level, it does not run the stop script if the lockfile does not exist. Therefore, our stop script for Notes was never called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never noticed this before since we don't have that many homemade services, and none of them ever complained when they were killed rather than shut down. And Linux servers don't need to be shut down that often. The problem doesn't seem to be that obvious; doing some Googling, I was unable to find any advice that rc scripts under Linux &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; use lock files in order to be called correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case of Notes, the use of lock files is inconvenient at best. Our Notes server processes run as user 'notes' rather than root, and our Notes admins log in as 'notes' to do server maintainance. However 'notes' is unable to write to the lock directory, so the lock directory may correctly reflect the status of the Notes processes. But for now, we're just happy that our Notes log files no longer get blown away by a system reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

The system had been scheduled to go into operation in August 2003, less than a year after the project was awarded to the consortium led by Daimler Chrysler and Deutsche Telekom. After several catastrophic failures during live testing, Toll Collect is now unable to commit to any start date. The agreement finally fell apart over liability for lost revenue of over 180 million Euros per month.&lt;/p&gt;

Voters are by definition always right, and if the Democrats want to beat Bush this fall, they have know what the voters want. And they don't want to be told that they are wrong. Outsiders wanting to understand the current mood in the US would do well to read these.&lt;/p&gt;

The result was amusing. &lt;/p&gt;

&quot;It is difficult to place you in a particular party. You correspond almost equally with FDP, CDU, and SPD.&quot; My politics are middle-of-the-road German (or maybe, to put it another way, simply wishy-washy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course,  I'm not actually eligible to vote in Hamburg (seeing as I don't live there and am not a German citizen), so I haven't really bothered to formulate exact positions. On law and order I'm rather liberal, I think the harbor and the Airbus plant should be expanded, I don't think the city needs to own hospitals and apartment complexes. That almost sounds like the FDP, except that the FDP is run by a bunch of idiots, especially in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's a follow up on my &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Mirow Blog&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2004/01/24/2819.php&quot;&gt;post last month&lt;/a&gt; on the weblog of SPD leading candidate in Hamburg, &lt;a title=&quot;MirowFuerHamburg.de: Treffpunkt f√ºr Unterst√ºtzer&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mirowfuerhamburg.de/&quot;&gt;Thomas Mirow&lt;/a&gt;. They've fixed some of the things I complained about in my first post. There's now a big link to the blog from the &lt;a title=&quot;Thomas Mirow - B√ºrgermeister f√ºr Hamburg&quot; href=&quot;http://www.thomasmirow.de/mirow/start.html&quot;&gt;campaign's main web site&lt;/a&gt;. The posters at the blog now call themselves &quot;Team Mirow&quot; instead of pretending to be Thomas Mirow... so they're still anonymous, but at least they are being honest about it. And the weblog now bills itself as a 'meeting place for supporters', which means the weblog has a clear and achievable focus. So did the makers of the weblog read my post and take my comments seriously? Well, maybe &lt;a title=&quot;Noch'n Blogg&quot; href=&quot;http://blogg.lumma.de/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of them did. Is that the reason that Red/Green has &lt;a title=&quot;Wahl in Hamburg: Umfrage: Aufw√§rtstrend bei rot-gr√ºn&quot; href=&quot;http://interferno.org/wahlinhamburg/archiv/000102.html&quot;&gt;pulled even&lt;/a&gt; with the CDU in the latest polls?

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a title=&quot;L√ºllauer Gegen-Wind&quot; href=&quot;http://www.luellauergegenwind.de/&quot;&gt;wind generator initiative&lt;/a&gt; is starting to post to the website (made with with Movable Type), and I've noticed a couple of things for which I wish I had a &lt;a title=&quot;MT Plugin Directory&quot; href=&quot;http://mt-plugins.org/&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, some people tend to copy and paste long text  from Word or from Outlook. (I try to tell them to link instead of copy, but they're volunteers and new at this.) The text tends to be word-wrapped with newlines within the paragraphs, which MT not so helpfully converts to line breaks. The otherwise excellent &lt;a title=&quot;Brad Choate: Textile&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bradchoate.com/mt-plugins/textile&quot;&gt;Textile&lt;/a&gt; plugin does the same thing. It would be nice to be able to turn convert-to-line-breaks on or off for individual posts, and still have paragraphs created with &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; tags. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that these long posts are awkward for archive pages. Yes, MT lets you enter an Extended Entry or an Excerpt, but I don't want to bother our volunteers with extra fields. And using FirstNWords tends to cut  sentences off in the middle of.... It would be nice if there were a tag like MTEntryFirstParagraph, which I could put in an archive template and know I'll also have complete sentences on the archive page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may already be easy ways to do this, and if not I could always write something myself. But by posting this, maybe somebody will have a pointer and save me the work of finding or writing it myself. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

We haven't had a &quot;wartime president&quot; since FDR, and there's a good reason for that: you're only a wartime president if you act like you're at war. That means placing the country on a wartime footing, putting aside petty politics to forge a bipartisan wartime consensus, and telling the nation in no uncertain terms that sacrifices need to be made. George Bush has done none of those things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No, wait, change that title to &quot;I'm Now A &lt;em&gt;Professional&lt;/em&gt; Writer!&quot;. I now have Google Ads on my individual entry pages, and on the home page (if you look &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; at the bottom). I had actually applied to AdSense several months ago, but was rejected then (too many Christopher pics that week?). Inspired by the tasteful addition of ads by &lt;a title=&quot;vowe dot net :: Google ads here to stay for a while&quot; href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/004055.html&quot;&gt;vowe&lt;/a&gt;, I reapplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am mostly curious about what kind of ads will be selected for my posts. I am also curious whether my writing will change, knowing I will get paid more for better posts. I've already made one change. I had removed the entry title from the individual entries in an effort to discourage casual Googlers. But now I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; Googlers to stop by, so I added the titles back. Bring them on!&lt;/p&gt;

We have the red/green coalition, both Union parties are black, the Free Democrats are yellow (in color, not necessarily in courage), any far-right parties are brown, and the Democratic Socialists are red (in the &quot;better dead than red&quot; sense). Although now the CDU is trying to establish &lt;a title=&quot;Christian Democratic Union of Germany (Germany)&quot; href=&quot;http://flagspot.net/flags/de%7Dcdu.html&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt; as a marketing color, so much that they've even colored Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust's face &lt;a title=&quot;Ole von Beust - aber wer ist auf dem Plakat?

   <title>The art of updating gracefully</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/02/06/the-art-of-updating-gracefully/"/>
   <updated>2004-02-06T04:02:45+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/02/06/the-art-of-updating-gracefully</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing I've come to appreciate maintaining FreeBSD machines is the benefit of keeping systems continuously up to date. It's like going to the dentist... you are going to have to do it sometime anyway, and the sooner and more often you do it, the less it's going to hurt. FreeBSD makes it easy to keep current, since the applications in the ports are separated from the system itself. You can update the ports as needed, and I choose to update the system only every 2nd minor version with security patches as needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My co-workers on the Linux side were more of the &quot;never touch a running system&quot; philosophy, so I inherited a few machines with, shall we say, a few cobwebs. Yes, the services that are there still run, but eventually you're going to need a new feature or a security patch. It's then impossible to add anything new without compiling all components by hand, and even then it might be impossible to get a current PHP or OpenLDAP running. My oldest victim is a fax server with RedHat 6.something, with a 2.0 kernel from 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My policy for Linux is that all servers will run a supported distribution. We will use stock RPMs when we can, and produce our own RPMs when we cannot. When security patches are no longer available, we will &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pclinuxonline.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;amp;file=article&amp;amp;sid=7018&quot; title=&quot;How to upgrade Mandrake easily with only one reboot&quot;&gt;upgrade in place&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to upgrade 8.x machines to 9.2 without problem. For the 7.x machines it was easier to do a fresh install and migrate. That old RedHat machine is still waiting for me. But if I stick to my policy, I'm never going to have to do this again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's a good idea to reboot every couple of months or so. We're not trying to set any uptime records here, and you need to know that in case of a power cut, everything will come back up.&lt;/p&gt;

The prosecution will appeal the verdict, and the Hamburg Justice Ministry has announced they will begin deportation proceedings. The case against Mzoudi was thin to begin with. The investigation against him was still incomplete as he was arrested attempting to leave Germany. The United States did not share witnesses and evidence that could have led to a conviction, citing the need to keep certain information from becoming public. It's a difficult choice, deciding between a conviction of a terrroist collaborator and keeping information secret that could help future terrorists. It's better to let a guilty man go free than to endanger future victims, but it is a bitter decision for the families of past victims.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/02/04/anti-americanism-in-germany</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember when it meant something to be anti-American, when one had to really prove himself to earn this title. Kidnap Americans, take over their embassies, kill and maim them, burn their homes and businesses. Now that standard has been lowered. According to this &lt;a title=&quot;Davids Medienkritik: German Contradictions / Deutsche Widersp√ºche&quot; href=&quot;http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2004/01/this_is_an_exce.html&quot;&gt;thread at Medienkritik&lt;/a&gt; (a blog dedicated to anti-Americanism), these days it's enough to read Michael Moore and oppose the Iraq war. Sorry, for me expressing opinion is as American as it gets, and merely expressing opinions against a particular administration, especially when the same opinions are held by a good number of Americans, does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; qualify one as anti-American. No, to become anti-American you need to threaten me for who I am, for the color of my passport. Mere disagreement does not qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the thread brings a number of offensive anti-German prejudices to light. Germans are Nazis. Germans are greedy. Germans never forgive. Germans are undemocratic. Replace all the 'Germans' with 'Jews', and you'd have a number of quotes worthy of Martin Hohmann.&lt;/p&gt;

Figures, it's not really a state that one travels &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; (unless one is taking a road trip to, say, Winnipeg). And even if one is flying &lt;a title=&quot;Northwest Airlines, the state airline of the Midwest&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nwa.com/&quot;&gt;Aeroflot-USA&lt;/a&gt;, nowadays you're more likely to change planes at Detroit or Memphis than at their home base of MSP.

   <title>BackupPC: Performance Problems Solved?</title>

   <updated>2004-02-02T20:02:05+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/02/02/backuppc-performance-problems-solved</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven't been keeping up my &lt;a title=&quot;Backup PC - PapaScottWiki&quot; href=&quot;https://www.papascott.de/tavi/index.php?page=BackupPC&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; like I promised. The performance problems with &lt;a title=&quot;BackupPC: Open Source Backup to disk&quot; href=&quot;http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;BackupPC&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned there have been getting progressively worse. A full backup was taking 48 hours, and the incremental would take 16 hours on the slowest machine on a bad day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem seems to have been using an ext3 file system... the millions of inodes are too much for ext3 to handle. I found a post on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=backuppc-users&quot;&gt;backuppc-users mailing list at SourceForge&lt;/a&gt; (the list is borked at the moment, I can't like to the entry) suggested using reiserfs or xfs instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have no experience with xfs, I choose reiser. Over the weekend, I reformatted (taking a PartImage first, 80GB takes 8 hours), and the full backup was done in 15 hours. This evening the incremental was done in 3 hours. If this keeps up even after we have a month of backups on the partition, I'll be very happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing still bothers me, though. I was able to see that things were slow. The load was high, all of the BackupPC processes were waiting for something. But we couldn't see what. I assumed they were waiting on the network, that the clients were slow (they all had high iowait), but it turned out they were waiting on the file system on the server. Shouldn't I have seen that in the system statistics? Where should I have looked?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>State of Mind</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;statemap.gif&quot; src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/02/statemap.gif&quot; width=&quot;111&quot; height=&quot;68&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;World66, the travel guide you write: visitedStates&quot; href=&quot;http://world66.com/myworld66/visitedStates&quot;&gt;Counting states visited&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the meme of the weekend, so here's my map of states visited. Most of the red spots are from two moves cross-crountry (CA-MN and MN-AZ) and two bus trips (NYC and DC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seeing peoples' maps reminds me of my great-aunt Violet, who managed to visit all state capitols back when there were only 48. She lived on a ranch in Nebraska back when there were still real cowboys. She turns 98 this year, and she's been in the hospital the past two weeks with pneumoni a. At 98, small problems can complicate quickly, and in her case she is unable to swallow and therefore cannot eat or drink. She's awake and alert, and has opted for a feeding tube. We're hoping she can hang in there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The supposed Iranian ex-agent Zakeri testified today in the Mzoudi terror trial, and was not very convincing, according to radio reports and &lt;a title=&quot;Mzoudi-Prozess: Der Schuss ist nach hinten losgegangen - Panorama - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,284410,00.html&quot;&gt;Spiegel Online&lt;/a&gt;. Zakeri, who claims also to have worked for the CIA and the German BND, could only say that he heard from an unidentified Iranian official that Mzoudi was among the 9/11 plotters. Hearsay from an unreliable witness. Mzoudi is almost certain to acquitted when the verdict is announced, now scheduled for next Thursday, unless the prosecution finds another secret witness.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Say the magic words</title>

   <updated>2004-01-27T19:01:30+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/01/27/say-the-magic-words</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago my wife had her purse stolen. All her cash and cards were gone. Credit cards, EC cards, DL, ID card, frequent flyer cards. She noticed within 30 minutes and had all her cards stopped. No harm done, except for the cash, and the temporary emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bank, when stopping the EC cards, stops all cards for the account. So my EC cards were stopped as well. And since we use an online bank, there's no brick-and-mortar branch where we can make withdrawls. We've gone through this before, new cards take about a week. So we wait for the new cards to arrive. And wait. And wait. We nearly had a crisis when she needed a new outfit for work, since her favorite shop doesn't accept credit cards (which arrived after just 2 days). Good thing we know of a supermarket that takes Visa, we don't starve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2 weeks, my wife calls the bank. When she called to have the cards stopped, she never said that she wanted a replacement card. So it was never ordered. New cards take about a week. So we wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today a card arrives in the mail. One card. For my wife. Not me. We call the bank. When she ordered  a replacement cards, she never said that the partner card needed to be replaced as well. So it was never ordered. New cards take about a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now my cash reserve consists of coins all 20 cents or less. My wife flies to Barcelona tomorrow for 3 days on business. I hope she leaves me some spending money.&lt;/p&gt;

They're all making the same basic mistake. They never did blogging at the Dean campaign. They have a house organ, it was a fictional thing, always glad about the good news, even when the news was bad. Weblogs are grounded in reality, they report on anything that an intelligent and curious person would want to know. The Dean blog assumes that you are a convert to the cause. The Dean weblog is not a trial of blogs in a presidential campaign, when that day comes, there won't be a disconnect between the candidate... and what's on the Web.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As can be read at &lt;a title=&quot;Thomas Mirow bloggt!!

&lt;p&gt;However, my first impression of MirowFuerHamburg is exactly that of Mirow himself: flat and lifeless. He's not Howard Dean, he's a quiet party insider. While I might want Dean on my side in a street fight, I would only want Mirow on my side in a room full of accountants. As for the weblog itself, the (anonymous) fluffy postings remind me of the pseudo 'weblog' at &lt;a title=&quot;GeorgeWBush.com :: Official Blog&quot; href=&quot;http://www.georgewbush.com/blog/&quot;&gt;GeorgeWBush.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weblog doesn't seem to fit in the SPD campaign concept of focusing on issues in contrast to Pretty Boy von Buest. I have the feeling the weblog was started because a couple of techies  thought it would be cool to have a weblog, rather than being part of a well thought-out campaign strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Hamburg SPD had been serious about using weblogs as a politcial tool, they would have started six months ago, before the self-destruction of the CDU/Schill/FDP coaliition, not just 35 days before the election. Now, it will just be lost in the whole 'campaign internet presence'. They don't even a link to to weblog at the main campaign site. To be fair, the weblog went online ahead of schedule, and may yet develop into something interesting and useful. But for now, it's neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, after Die Zeit it's yet another coup for the Hamburg blogging service blogg.de.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two years ago we had 5 network sysadmins at our company. Last year we had 3. One left last month, another broke her arm and is out sick, and third one is me. And I am alone until my colleague can peck at a keyboard. And our network is no less complex than when there were 5 of us. Until now I've had nothing to do with our internal routing, I was strictly external. Up until last month I deferred firewall requests to my more knowledgable colleagues. Now, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; the firewall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been able to fake my way through most problems. A couple of routing problems I was not able to fake my through, and thus I was able to &quot;gain valuable experience&quot; (i.e. learn by screwing up). Hint: a router sends packets exactly how it is told. If it isn't told where to find an address, the packets disappear, just like luggage at the airport without a checkin tag . My co-workers are at least sympathetic than I am covering bases for 3 peopel. But my brain hurts at the end of the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is hope on the horizon. Our accomodation, flight, and rental car for Florida in April are as of this evening all booked.&lt;/p&gt;

But her return home in late December turned surreal and terrifying when Homeland Security officials at Kennedy Airport rejected her travel documents, confiscated her passport, then detained her and the 3-month-old overnight in a room with shackled drug suspects. They let her go only after ordering her to leave the country no later than tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Is there a good WYSIWYG blog editor out there? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zempt.com&quot;&gt;Zempt&lt;/a&gt; looks nice, and the price is right, but it isn't WYSIWYG. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogjet.com&quot;&gt;BlogJet&lt;/a&gt; isn't ready yet. Am I missing something obvious? Or should I be looking at inline solutions like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/&quot;&gt;htmlArea&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com&quot;&gt;Heiko&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to &lt;a href=&quot;http://w.bloggar.com&quot;&gt;w.bloggar&lt;/a&gt;, which again isn't WYSIWYG (but like Zempt has a preview window) but is localized for German.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Appropriate for MLK Day and Iowa Caucus Day, I received my absentee ballot for the Arizona Democratic Primary today. The Maricopa County Recorder was kind enough to send it by Express Mail to make sure my vote can be counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember my first caucus, back in 1980 in Minnesota. I was a high school senior, and belonged to the dark side (Independent Republicans, as they were known in MN back then). I forget who I supported for President (not Reagan... Bush? Dole?). But I did get elected to the county, and then the congressional district convention. One of the candidates looked me up at my after-school job, cleaning the meat market at the local grocers. He shook my hand, even though I was covered with blood and beef fat. Even though he wasn't local and was too conservative for my taste, he got my vote, he won the nomination, and was elected. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediatransparency.org/people/vin_weber.htm&quot;&gt;Vin Weber&lt;/a&gt; was one of the conservative stars in the House in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That August, one day before nominating Ronald Reagan, the National Republican Convention voted to drop support for the Equal Rights Amendment, and I vowed to never support the Republicans again. That fall I voted for John Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Christopher picked out a &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon.de: B√ºcher: Flip, der kleine Delphin&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3551086516/qid=1073768033&quot;&gt;picture book&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.carlsenkids.de/programm/lesemaus/&quot;&gt;Carlsen 'Lesemaus' series&lt;/a&gt;. It is  about a baby dolphin, including pictures of the dolphin being born and nursing. OK, we can handle questions about that. The birth isn't so interesting for Christopher yet, but he noticed the nursing. 'The baby dolphin is drinking, like I used to drink from Mama!' Is his memory really that good? Not really... when I read to him this evening, he said he used to drink from Papa. Mama could only laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/01/10/two-polls</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Polls don't mean anything come election day, but they are interesting nonetheless. The ARD &lt;a title=&quot;tagesschau.de : Sonntagsfrage: Union verliert absolute Mehrheit&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID2827436_TYP6_THE2827398_NAV2827398_REF_BAB,00.html&quot;&gt;DeutschlandTREND&lt;/a&gt;  shows the Union falling below an absolute majority in the &quot;Sunday question&quot; for the first time in 5 months, but still with 48%. Winners were not red/green (26%/10%), but the FDP (7%) and the PDS (5%!). Has the far-left flight from the SPD to the ex-communists begun? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile locally, 7 weeks before the Hamburg election &lt;a title=&quot;Hamburg: Aktuelle Wahlumfrageergebnisse [jimmiz journal]&quot; href=&quot;http://jimmiz.blogg.de/eintrag.php?id=156&quot;&gt;Mayor von Beust and the CDU have a comfortable lead&lt;/a&gt; (47%) over Mirow and the SPD (30%). The Greens have 11%, FDP 2%, old Schill 2%, and new Schill (Pro-DM) 4%.  With coalition partners, von Beust is only 6 points ahead of red/green, and if Schill somehow gets over 5% all bets are off.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Practice Fee</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/01/09/practice-fee/"/>
   <updated>2004-01-09T21:01:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/01/09/practice-fee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All week long we've been hearing stories about the chaos caused by the new 'practice fee' &lt;em&gt;(Praxisgeb√ºhr)&lt;/em&gt; for health care introduced at the beginning of the year. Applied to those with public health insurance (90% of all Germans), 10 Euros is to be paid for each doctor visited per quarter in cash at the time of the first visit. The fee is waived for children and for referrals. The idea is to discourage patients from going directly to specialists without a referral from their family physician. Although the fee is collected by physicians, it goes entirely to the insurance funds. The physicians bear the administrative costs and the risk for those patients they treat but who refuse to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the devil is in the details. Germans in the public insurance system have never seen a bill for their health care... now they suddenly have to pay before they see a doctor. The fee also applies to emergency rooms and ambulances (unless you called the ambulance through 110), so emergency personnel need to carry cash boxes and issue receipts. (The fee also applies to those given care involuntarily... imagine trying to collect cash from a drunk being admitted to detox.) The fee applies to welfare recipients and pensioners. There is a cap of 2% of annual income (1% for the 'chronically ill', which the law doesn't really define) for all practice fees and co-payments... so make sure you save all your receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fee was part of the bi-partisan health reform law of last year, so both major parties are to blame. Best of all, the members of Bundestag &lt;a title=&quot;Praxisgeb√ºhren-Rabatt: Die Parlamentarier haben verstanden - Wirtschaft - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,281184,00.html&quot;&gt;exempted themselves from the fee&lt;/a&gt;, along with civil servents. Instead of 10 Euros per doctor per quarter, they pay a flat 20 Euros per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is the practice fee will quickly be repealed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the first consequence of our visit with the &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott : Speech Therapy&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/12/23/2769.php&quot;&gt;speech therapist&lt;/a&gt; last month, we took Christopher to a ear-nose-throat specialist today. He told us what we already suspected: Christopher has fluid behind the eardrums in both ears, his adenoids are enlarged, and he is a classic candidate for an adenoidectomy. I was surprised that he recommended surgery right away (I had a similar operation at age 8), but doing some reading I learned that such a procedure at age 4 is not unusual, and these days can be done as an out-patient. We've made an appointment for the end of the month. We also had a hearing test done, but since Christopher was somewhat uncooperative, the results were inconclusive. He only hears what he wants to hear. Don't we all?&lt;/p&gt;

I've been assuming that I wouldn't have a voice in deciding the Democratic presidential nominee, but now I see that Arizona, the state where I was last a resident and thus where I am registered to vote, holds their primary on February 3. And I should have requested my ballot by the end of December! I'll rush my request, and I guess I'll  have to inform myself and make up my mind after all... Dean or Clark or someone else? The last time I did this was in 1988 in the precinct caucuses in Minnesota. Back then I was a Jackson (as in Jesse) delegate. Times have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Really Stupid Atom Support</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/01/03/really-stupid-atom-support/"/>
   <updated>2004-01-03T16:01:55+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2004/01/03/really-stupid-atom-support</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(for &lt;a href=&quot;http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Magpie RSS 0.52&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/&quot;&gt;Feed on Feeds 0.1.1&lt;/a&gt;).  Many blogs are already sporting Atom 0.3 feeds, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diveintomark.org/&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; have even declared their RSS to be deprecated. So I decided to try to bolt Atom support onto my aggregator of choice. It turned out to be pretty easy, requiring patching just 2 files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my approach is very simplistic, simply representing Atom items in Magpie such that FoF can understand and display them. I'm sure that Kellan and Steve will eventually fully support Atom feeds. But until they do, here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2004/01/rsas.patch.gz&quot;&gt;patch to init.php and parse_rss.inc&lt;/a&gt;. I thought about calling it 'Really Stupid Support for Atom', but the acronym 'RSS for Atom' would have confusing to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this works for me, at least for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/atom.xml&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/xml/atom.xml&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ahawkins.org/atom.xml&quot;&gt;feeds&lt;/a&gt; I've tried. It may not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you're interested in the gory details, I basically made 3 changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magpie will parse anything that remotely resembles RSS without bothering to validate it. While RSS is a 'channel' containing several 'items', Atom is a 'feed' containing several 'entries'. So I just told magpie to treat a 'feed' as a channel and an 'entry' as an item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magpie doesn't parse XML attributes at all. However, 'links' in Atom are defined purely as attributes, and each 'feed' or 'entry' can have several links, while in RSS a 'link' is simply a string. So I had Magpie create an array of items for each link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I then told FoF about the new elements in the array, for example to use the 'tagline' for the 'description' if it exists. I also wrote a function for FoF to select the first appropriate link if the link is an array instead of a string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Speech Therapy</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/12/23/speech-therapy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had our initial appointment with the child speech therapist yesterday. He confirmed that Christopher is way behind in his speech development for his age. This could be caused by a combination of environmental factors: being a (spoiled) only child, having two working parents, spending full days in day care, and having a non-native-speaking parent (which I can confirm; I simply have no idea how well a 4-year-old German child should speak, and I have no ear for subtle mistakes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we should check for physical causes as well. His 4-year checkup is beginning of next month, and we should tell the pediatrician about our concerns. He hasn't been sick the last year at all, but he had a couple of ear infections when he was younger, and he probably inherited my susceptibility to ear, nose and throat infections. I think I remember seeing a speech therapist as a child (but I'm not sure... Grandma?). If my memory is not invented, I remember it as something I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll probably start week appointments at the end of January. My shortened hours at work will make it easier to plan. Meanwhile, we (espcially Mama, maybe Oma) are to read with (not to) him as much as she can, and let him explain the stories in his own words. I was right to stop speaking English with him for now. We do not need to be concerned about stuttering at this point, as it is normal at this age for children to think more quickly than they can speak. But at 4 he should be able to speak clearly and in complete sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm up early, but the politicians are just going to bed. At 3 am the government and the opposition &lt;a title=&quot;NETZEITUNG DEUTSCHLAND: Regierung und Union einigen sich auf Reformkompromiss&quot; href=&quot;http://www.netzeitung.de/deutschland/265466.html&quot;&gt;announced an agreement&lt;/a&gt; on tax cuts, unemployment and welfare reform, subsidy cuts, flexilbility in the job market, Agenda 2010 and just about everything else that Schr√∂der wanted but was being blocked by the Bundesrat. It took the big guns to get it done... Schr√∂der, Merkel, Fischer, and Stoiber all appeared at the marathon conference committee meeting (oh, and Westerwelle too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was to split everything down the middle. The tax cut for 2004 is half of what Schr√∂der wanted, financed only 25% by borrowing. The subsidies for commuters and home owners will be cut by 30%. Protection against dismissal applies now to firms with 10 or more employees instead of 5. Local governments will have the option to manage long-term unemployed. Local governments get a bigger slice of business taxes. The question of exemptions to national union contracts was postponed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone got only half of what they wanted, but at least they got something, which is more than one can say about the EU summit in Brussels the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/12/14/devo-design</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you're observant, you'll have noticed that the design of this site has been simplified (as if it weren't simple before), inspired by recent changes at &lt;a title=&quot;Scripting News: 12/11/2003&quot; href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/2003/12/11#readersAggregatorsLinkblogsAndAnotherApproach&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;The Scobleizer Weblog&quot; href=&quot;http://scoble.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;Scobleizer&lt;/a&gt;. I've integrated the Quick Links into the main blog and simplified the permalinks (junking the 'Posted by Blah Blah Blah' bit). The Quick Links now have permalinks of their own and take comments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What looks simple actually took a bit of effort to pull off, since Movable Type isn't able to easily cusomize layouts based on category. The ~450 Quick Link entries needed to be assigned a category and moved to the main blog, which was easiest to do directly with MySQL. I wanted to not print titles for the Quick Links, which required the Extended Comments plugin from &lt;a title=&quot;Brad Choate: Welcome&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bradchoate.com/&quot;&gt;Brad Choate&lt;/a&gt;. For the remaining entries, I wanted to put the title within the paragraph tags for the entry body. This required a custom convert line break setting (break lines with br, but don't insert p tags), using the Format Breaks plugin from &lt;a title=&quot;Brad Choate: Welcome&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bradchoate.com/&quot;&gt;Brad Choate&lt;/a&gt;. Then I wanted to trwiddle the formatting for entries that either begin or end with an image, which required the Regex plugin from (you guessed it) &lt;a title=&quot;Brad Choate: Welcome&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bradchoate.com/&quot;&gt;Brad Choate&lt;/a&gt;. It would have been a lot easier if he packaged all his plugins together :-).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bilingual Education</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/12/12/bilingual-education/"/>
   <updated>2003-12-12T20:12:05+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/12/12/bilingual-education</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my last set of Christopher pictures, hans &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Music&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/12/11/2749.php&quot;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt; whether we are raising Christopher bilingually. The answer is more complicated than just yes or no (although this quick answer is I don't speak English with Christopher as much as I should).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, my wife would speak German with Christopher and I would speak English. In practice, I find it difficult to consistently speak English with him. Unlike most of the Anglo-German couples we know, we speak German rather than English at home. Actually, we agreed to speak the language of whatever country we're in, so when we're in the States we speak (mostly) English, and when we are in France or Italy... then we are in trouble. Anyway, while this was good for my German, it means I am totally out of the habit of speaking English around the house. I have to remember to make the effort, and Christopher answers in German anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bilingual kids we know are like that. They understand the English-speaking parent perfectly, but will answer in German. Only when visiting with relatives that speak no German at all are they willing to speak English. Only later (around 10 or 12) are they willing to speak the second language on their own. The exception is when the parent pretends not to understand German at all... and I'm not willing to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also a bit reluctant to push English on Christopher right now, since we're concerned about his speech skills in general. He speaks somewhat unclearly, and our day care provider has recommended a speech therapist. Our initial appointment is this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a title=&quot;Kids-Club e.V. Bendestorf&quot; href=&quot;http://www.kids-club-ev.de/&quot;&gt;local organization&lt;/a&gt; that offers English classes for kids as young as 3. We even took Christopher to a couple of classes, but he wasn't ready to be left alone and it wasn't worth my taking 3 hours off work to drive him to a 45 minute class where he didn't want to be. So, I'm sure that Christopher will someday be bilingual, but he isn't yet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mixed  Signals</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/12/11/mixed-signals/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/12/11/mixed-signals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm sure everyone has heard about the Pentagon's decision to bar countries which opposed the war from reconstruction contracts in Iraq. Now, the Pentagon can award contracts however it wants, and 6 months ago I would have expected such a pronouncement. Now it seems very confusing, since all the signals the US has been sending this fall is that it wants international help in Iraq, even from Germany,  even in small amounts, and even if only in the form of development aid and debt relief. The contracts could have been quietly directed to countries found suitable. Instead, Wolfowitz is flipping a very visible middle finger in the direction of Old Europe. It makes you &lt;a title=&quot;NY Times: Bidding for Isolation&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/11/opinion/11THU2.html?ex=1386478800&amp;amp;en=c8d602c839422495&amp;amp;ei=5007&amp;amp;partner=USERLAND&quot;&gt;wonder what Washington really wants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may even make you wonder if Washington itself knows what it wants, since Bush was &lt;a title=&quot;Calpundit: Oh Yes, The Grownups Are Truly In Charge&quot; href=&quot;http://www.calpundit.com/archives/002835.html&quot;&gt;on the phone the next day&lt;/a&gt; with France, Germany and Russia trying to talk debt relief. This makes a parliamentary cabinet look good in comparison, where ministers are politicians rather than policy experts. The politicians may be lacking in technical knowledge, but they do at least have basic communication and coordination skills that seem to be lacking in the 'experts' in Washington, even after 3 years in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economically, such a boycott never makes sense. The boycotter, by accepting a second-best offer or worse, always suffers more than the boycottee (assuming that the agents are otherwise acting rationally, which is a huge leap of faith for government contracts, I admit). It's like me cutting off my nose to spite your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, the amount of money involved is too small to influence future policy. Everything else being equal, how much business would Germany have obtained? Maybe tens of millions? In a &lt;a title=&quot;Germany - Economy - GDP&quot; href=&quot;http://www.indexmundi.com/germany/gdp.html&quot;&gt;2 trillion dollar&lt;/a&gt; economy? That's not going to influence any politician, unless it's delivered in unmarked bills in black suitcase. But that's already been &lt;a title=&quot;BBC News | EUROPE | Cash scandal threatens Kohl legacy&quot; href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/589668.stm&quot;&gt;tried...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/12/07/the-american-dory</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher's Christmas package from Minnesota arrived yesterday. And, I admit it, I just had to take a peek... at the Finding Nemo DVD. Since the film was just released in Germany, it will be months before the DVD is available here. But it's OK. I'm an American citizen. I'm &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; to view Region 1 DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main suspicion was confirmed, namely that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brainpool.de/en/stars/engelke/&quot;&gt;Anke Engelke&lt;/a&gt;, the German voice of Dory, is a thousand times better than whoever did the original American Dory. But I was also disappointed. Dory's best line ('Kennen wir uns?', when she doesn't recognize Marlin the first time) is a dud in English ('Can I help you?').&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Ghost of Schill</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ghost of Schill continues to haunt the coalition in Hamburg. He was quiet for a while after having been &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: No Mercy&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/08/19/2519.php&quot;&gt;tossed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Schill Out&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/08/21/2522.php&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt; of the Senate by Mayor von Beust. Last weekend he was re-elected as the state party chair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week, however, he has returned to his old self, attacking von Beust, his successor Interior Minister Nockelmann. A new role in this coalition is unthinkable, given that von Beust has sworn to never again sit at the same table as Schill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his party, one week of the new-old Schill was enough. The  national party board has &lt;a title=&quot;Schill-Rauswurf: In Hamburg wackelt die Koalition - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,277266,00.html&quot;&gt;dismissed Schill as state chair&lt;/a&gt;. It's now &lt;a title=&quot;Noch'n Blogg.: Schill als Hamburger Landesvorsitzender abgesetzt&quot; href=&quot;http://lumma.de/mt/archives/000751.html#000751&quot;&gt;very possible&lt;/a&gt; that Schill will form his own faction in the Hamurg B√ºrgerschaft, take a couple of supporters with him, and force new elections. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandma sent Christopher a Christmas stocking. Since he's not familiar with American Christmas customs, he thought he had to wear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll set it out for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.training-for-germany.de/tips99/tip11.htm&quot;&gt;Nikolaus&lt;/a&gt; tonight. He's coming to our house a day late this year, and he's been informed to expect a stocking instead of a shoe. (The exact date doesn't matter, since Christopher is already a few days ahead with his Advent calendar.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;EU bans blogging? &lt;a title=&quot;Das E-Business Weblog: Das Ende des Bloggens?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2003/11/27/das_ende_des_bloggens.shtml&quot;&gt;Martin R√∂ll&lt;/a&gt; thinks that &lt;a title=&quot;Curia - CP0396EN&quot; href=&quot;http://curia.eu.int/en/actu/communiques/cp03/aff/cp0396en.htm&quot;&gt;this ruling&lt;/a&gt; from the European Court of Justice upholding a ruling in Swedien may be the start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs Lindqvist was involved in preparing people for Communion in the parish of Alseda (Sweden). At the end of 1998 she set up internet pages on her personal computer at home to enable parishioners preparing for Confirmation to obtain easily the information they were likely to need. Those pages contained information on Mrs Lindqvist and&lt;br /&gt;
18 of her colleagues in the parish, including their first names and sometimes their full names. Mrs Lindqvist also described the work done by her colleagues and their hobbies in mildly humorous terms. In several cases their family circumstances, their telephone number and other information were given. She also mentioned that one of her colleagues had injured her foot and was working part-time on medical grounds. Mrs Lindqvist was fined SEK 4 000 (approximately EUR 450) for processing personal data by automatic means without notifying the Datainspektion (Swedish supervisory authority for the protection of electronically transmitted data) in writing, for transferring data to third countries without authorisation and for processing sensitive personal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we don't blog, we  'process personal data by automatic means'. And so we need to register our blogs with the proper authorities, and get permission every time we refer to someone by name (or address or URL)? Or not?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Registered Mail</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/11/29/registered-mail</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title=&quot;Deutsche Post&quot; href=&quot;http://www.deutschepost.de/dpag?lang=de_EN&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; left a notice that there is a registered letter requiring my signature waiting for me. I can pick it up Monday after 10 am at the stationers, our local post agent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't expecting any such letter, and I have no idea what it could be. It might be for MamaMaus, although the form has clealy 'Frau' and 'Firma' crossed-out, so that the letter is for 'Herrn Hanson-Petersen' (which isn't me, there's no Petersen in my name, but that's beside the poinrt).  The last registered letter we received was for her, a speeding ticket (with fine and points). The US consulate sent my passport via registered mail. A pink slip from my employer might be registered, but the deadline for layoffs has passed for this quarter. Financial documents might also be sent registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am expecting a &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: (Not) Changing Religions&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/11/23/2712.php&quot;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; to arrive COD, and that would involve the same form being left in our mailbox, except that the 'COD' box would be ticked instead of that for 'Registered Mail'. I assume the post knows how to fill out their own forms. So I have no idea what to expect. It's probably not good news. It's either bad or indifferent. I'll let you know, unless the whole thing is too personal or embarassing. Then I won't.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arlo Guthrie: &quot;We got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump.  So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the city dump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the dump saying, 'Closed on Thanksgiving.'  And we had never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We didn't find one. Until we came to a side road, and off the side of the side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the cliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile is better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw our's down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's what we did, and drove back to the church, had a thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep and didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone call from officer Obie.  He said, 'Kid, we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it.' And I said, 'Yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope under that garbage.'...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;'Kid, whad'ya get?'  I said, 'I didn't get nothing, I had to pay $50 and pick up the garbage.'&quot; &lt;a title=&quot;LYRICS - Alice's Restaurant&quot; href=&quot;http://www.arlo.net/lyrics/alices.shtml&quot;&gt;continued&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>(Not) Changing Religions</title>

   <updated>2003-11-23T20:11:58+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/11/23/not-changing-religions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've known for a couple months that I would be buying a new notebook at the end of November. My Thinkpad (with SuSE 9.0) is somewhat long in tooth (at 400 MHz and 800x600), and the non-functional battery makes wireless a cruel joke. And like everyone else, I'm finding I spend a lot more time on my notebook, even at home, than at my desktop. I'll  be buying it myself, so price is a major issue. 1200 Euros is my target, 1500 the absolute maximum I can pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to choose an iBook, I really did. The new 12&quot; G4 is 1199 Euros, right on target. It has Unix pre-installed. It has geek credibility. And it looks cool. But 1199 Euros is not the end. I'd have to add an Airport card, since it can't take my old PCMCIA wireless card. And 256 MB RAM is a bit weak, would need to be upgraded. And I'd have to buy software, Net News Wire and BBEdit just for starters. And I would have to learn a new operating system, with its own &lt;a title=&quot;macosxhints - Repair permissions to resolve slow system issues&quot; href=&quot;http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030526181056549&quot;&gt;quirks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Apple Mac OS X 10.3.1 - MacUpdate&quot; href=&quot;http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/13052&quot;&gt;bugs&lt;/a&gt;, and be beholden to Apple, a company I neither like nor trust. Changing your operating system is like changing your religion. It's not a decision to be taken lightly... after all, your soul is at stake! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Windows is out of the question... the first thing I'd do with a Windows notebook is format the hard disk. So I was intrigued to see that the &lt;a title=&quot;Welcome to ASUS&quot; href=&quot;http://www.asus.com/products/notebook/l3000d/overview.htm&quot;&gt;Asus L3D series&lt;/a&gt; can be configured without any operating system, for about 1150 Euros.  SuSE 9.0 seems to &lt;a title=&quot;News: Pro-Linux: Testbericht zu SUSE LINUX 9.0&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pro-linux.de/cgi-bin/NB2/nb2.cgi?show.6070.1010.300000010161.&quot;&gt;run just fine&lt;/a&gt; with it (which I can't say for sure for a Centrino). With a mobile Athlon 2500+ and 512 MB, it's powerful and cool enough. It's big and heavy, but it won't be leaving the house much. And I'll be able to leverage the software and knowledge I already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've given myself 24 hours to change my mind, in case any evangelists want me to convert to Apple or Dell or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Welcome to everyone coming over from &lt;a href=&quot;http://macsurfer.com/&quot;&gt;MacSurfer&lt;/a&gt;, and thanks for adding your comments (even if they are somewhat one-sided :-).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the autobahn this morning, a plastic pallet fell from a truck onto the road. Hardly a notable event, except that it occurred directly in front of me. I was unable to avoid the obstacle, and thus drove over it. My right front tire did not survive the encounter, and neither did the wheel. Just to make things interesting, my spare was flat as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All's well that ends well. The auto club pumped up the spare, I limped into my local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atu.de&quot;&gt;ATU&lt;/a&gt;, left them my car and took the bus to work. I now have 4 spanking new tires. And dirty fingernails. And am short 2 hours on my time sheet at work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An interesting twist on comment spam. My latest post on &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Hohmann Go Home&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/11/11/2694.php&quot;&gt;Martin Hohmann&lt;/a&gt; attracted a generic comment linking to a neo-Nazi news site. I've removed the links, and closed discussion on that post, but I've left the comment and the URLs for the sake of discussion. The comment &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; vaguely on-topic (as the post is on anti-semitism), and even neo-Nazis have the right to free speech. But on my blog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Actually, since PapaScott is hosted with a German domain on a German host, and is therefore subject to German law,  neo-Nazis do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a right to free speech on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Up til now, my WiFi setup has been pretty simple... no access point, just ad-hoc mode with an Elsa 11 MBit card in my notebook and a matching card in my floppy ISDN router. No authentication, no encryption... the cows in the pasture out back could steal all the bandwidth they waned. But I was never able to MamaMaus' notebook to connect. And she kept taking my notebook to check her Ebay auctions. There may also be a new notebook in my future, so it was time to upgrade to a real access point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the &lt;a title=&quot;vowe's choice: Linksys WRT54G&quot; href=&quot;http://vowe.net/whatiuse/archives/003672.php&quot;&gt;Linksys WRT54G&lt;/a&gt;, because it was cheap and supports 54 MBit (which is in Mama's new Centrino notebook). It's designed for DSL, but works fine with ISDN. So Mama can now surf from the couch, I can work on my ThinkPad , and WEP is enabled so the cows can't snoop our packets anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing it lacks is static DHCP tables... if DHCP is enabled, there's no way to assigned a fixed IP address to a certain MAC address, which makes it impossible to maintain an internal domain. So now I'm letting the floppy router do DHCP, like it did before. The Linksys is no longer in gateway mode, so it's not really a router anymore, just a switch with ears.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In defence of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/11/13/2701.php&quot;&gt;Roadster&lt;/a&gt; incident, MamaMaus offers this picture (taken for insurance purposes) of the gas pump in question, which at the bottom carries a V-Power sticker on the &lt;em&gt;diesel&lt;/em&gt; side of the pump. Therefore, at first glance, it is not totally stupid to believe that V-Power is some sort of souped-up diesel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see who ends paying for the damage. Unless, of course, it comes out of our pocket, in which case it would be not interesting, but tragic.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>BackupPC</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/11/14/backuppc/"/>
   <updated>2003-11-14T06:11:26+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/11/14/backuppc</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The past couple of weeks I've been evaluating &lt;a title=&quot;BackupPC: Open Source Backup to disk&quot; href=&quot;http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;BackupPC&lt;/a&gt;, an open source backup to hard disk program. It uses standard client programs like rsync and tar or can read Windows smb shares, so there is nothing to install on the clients. It has a nice web interface (mod perl) for administering full and incremental backups and for retrieving restored files (either save to client or retrieve as tar or zip archive via http), Best of all, it has a intelligent pool system so that identical files from various clients are stored only once. So if you have several dozen identical workstations, your disk space requirement for the backup is the size of a single workstation, or less if you turn on compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to use it for something different, which is why it's taken me so long to get it going. We want to take nightly backups of our development servers, specifically the working directories of our developers with their CVS playgrounds. The servers are under load literally both day (development) and night (daily builds). A typical partition is 20 GB with 1.5 million files, with lots of duplicates . Our tape drives are maxxed out, so we'd like to put the daily backups on disk and archive to tape just once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem was not setting up BackupPC itself, but setting up the clients. My test machines all had good performance, but under real conditions rsync was simply too slow, taking 20 hours for a full and 12 hours for an incremental, putting load on both server and client. The testing process was somewhat tedious, since I had to wait overnight each time for results. But I've finally found settings that work... using tar over ssh (rsh is not an option) reniced in a wrapper script on the backup client to -19. The full backups still take 20 hours (that's OK, we'll do full backups on weekends), but the incrementals are done in 3 hours. Bingo. Now we can get everything done overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll try things our for a few more days, but it looks like we'll be able to put this system into production.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some days it is just better to stay in bed. Today MamaMaus was under stress at work, more than usual. But she's paid well to handle stress, and one of her perks is the new BMW 500 class TurboDiesel she drives to the office. Today she was running both late and low on fuel, so she pulled into Shell, drove up to the diesel pump, and filled up with &lt;a title=&quot;Shell Tankstellen&quot; href=&quot;http://www.shell-select.de/fr_index_fl.asp?link=/pages/station/unterwegs/vpower.html&quot;&gt;V-Power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell V-Power is not diesel. It's 100 octane SuperPlus gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, her onboard computer reported 'Motor Damage', and this time it was not an error. The repair will cost 4000 Euros and will take at least a week. During that time she'll be driving a loaner &lt;a title=&quot;smart.com - roadster&quot; href=&quot;http://www.smart.de/-snm-0135155096-1068460332-0000026314-0000000004-1068752455-enm-smart/content/de/de/smart/modelle/smartroadster&quot;&gt;Smart Roadster&lt;/a&gt;, which is easily a half-size smaller than my Twingo. And worst of all, her boss tomorrow is going to have a huge laugh at her expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then 3-1/2 weeks ago I stepped on the scale and I was back up to 101.6 kg. I decided to start  Atkins again. This morning I was at 96.9 kg, so altogether in 2 stretches I've lost nearly 10 kg, or over 20 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm documenting this success for myself, in case I should get bored with it again. I'd like to get down to 85 kg if I can.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At work we have typical German work contracts which can be terminated with 6 weeks notice before the end of a quarter. The next termination date is next Wednesday, and there are rumors that there will be layoffs announced for the end of the year, despite our having worked short time for the past 6 months. One of sysadmins decided not to wait and found something new. That makes the jobs for the rest of us sysadmins more secure (assuming we stay in business), but it also means we all have more work. And more bullet points for the CV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other things, I'll now be responsible for all our Linux installations, about 60 workstations and a dozen servers. I'll be the resident Linux expert, except that I don't feel like an expert at all. Sure, I've been using Linux for nearly 10 years, but I haven't been keeping up with the latest developments, and lately I've been happy to run a stock commerical distribution (Mandrake at work, SuSE at home). So I have some learning to do. At least it beats learning Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

I even tried to push the story to other blogs to make sure it would not go unnoticed. How wrong I was. Pressure has built on the CDU leadership to go beyond censuring Homann, especially after Defence Minister Struck &lt;a title=&quot;BBC NEWS | Europe | German forces 'not anti-Semitic'&quot; href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3245039.stm&quot;&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the general in charge of Germany's special forces (KSK) for supporting Hohmann. &lt;/p&gt;

That can be very disquieting when doing 200 on the Autobahn. Just so you know.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though the names were not limited to the 20th century, there was still a huge hole from the Nazi period. For those who are interested how Germans view their own history, the top 10 in alphabetical order are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konrad Adenauer&lt;br /&gt;
Johann S. Bach&lt;br /&gt;
Otto v. Bismarck&lt;br /&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;em&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/em&gt; is out of town for a conference, and MamaMaus is covorting on Malta, so I'm home alone with Christopher. Actually, I'm splitting the time so that today I have Christopher and his best friend Janik, while tomorrow they are both at Janik's house. Janik just started first grade, so we pick him up at school at 11:30 (yes, that's the wonderful German half-day school system). Wish me luck on surviving the afternoon! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, attending the &lt;a title=&quot;Meeting tonight by Heiko Hebig | hebig.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/archives/001664.shtml&quot;&gt;Blogger Treff in Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; this evening is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The USA to which I came in July 1996 was a completely different country than the USA that I am now leaving: well-off, self-satisfied, open, optimistic. It was the land of Bill Clinton and the Internet, sudden wealth, free of worries. Today on the other hand, my adopted countrymen find themselves being driven from one fear to the next (and many of them let themselves be driven), threatend, despised, isolated. Who is responsible for this change -  everyone has his own their theory, I'm sure. I've been so close to the action that right now I don't have an overview, I'm missing the big picture. But I already noticed in  1996/1997 how helpful it sometimes is to leave a country and to observe it from the outside.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome home, and keep on blogging!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ARD evening news Tagesschau &amp;lt;a title=&quot;tagesschau.de : CDU-Abgeordneter nennt Juden &quot;T√§tervolk&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID2535334_REF1,00.html&quot;&amp;gt;reported last night on the CDU Bundestag back-bencher Martin Hohmann, who on October 3rd gave a &lt;a title=&quot;tagesschau.de : Vollst√§ndige Rede Hohmanns&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID2535644,00.html&quot;&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; to his local party comparing the violence of the Russian Revolution to the Halocaust, saying that Jews could be called 'a criminal people' &lt;em&gt;(T√§tervolk)&lt;/em&gt; for the crimes of the Bolscheviks, citing Henry Ford's &lt;a title=&quot;Anti-Semitism of 1920's Revived on Web - The International Jew&quot; href=&quot;http://www.adl.org/special_reports/ij/intro.asp&quot;&gt;'The International Jew'&lt;/a&gt; and calling for 'justice for Germans'. The speech would have gone unnoticed had it not appeared on the &lt;a title=&quot;CDU Gemeindeverband Neuhof - Zukunft hat einen Namen&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cdu-neuhof.de/&quot;&gt;local party website&lt;/a&gt; (content now removed). The national CDU leadership has distanced itself from Hohmann and his remarks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not Hohmann's first time in the national spotlight. A year ago he was &lt;a title=&quot;'Gerechtigkeit f√ºr Deutschland': Martin Hohmann zum Nationalfeiertag&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hagalil.com/archiv/2003/10/hohmann.htm&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; in a report on radical-rightists in the CDU. While it is good that such opinions are brought (somewhat belatedly) to light by the national media, it would be better if they would call the &lt;a title=&quot;telepolis: Antiglobalisierungsbewegung und Antisemitismus&quot; href=&quot;http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/inhalt/co/12485/1.html&quot;&gt;same bullshit on the left&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Others may blog about not wanting to blog... I just do it, with the exception of some Christopher pictures and a few quick links. Father, forgive me, it has been over two weeks since my last real post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it's because I'm irritable, due to carbohydrate withdrawl. Losing weight is easy, I've done it dozens of times. This time I really mean it. Really, I do.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I probably won't make the Blogger-Treff in Hamburg next week, since Mama is in Malta all week, and we have no day care Thursday and Friday.&lt;/li&gt;

Wouldn't they look great in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; office? The leather couch also makes a wonderful changing table, as we know from experience. And since the set must be picked up at her office in Hamburg, you'll have the chance to meet Mrs. PapaScott up close and personal. Bidding ends in 8 days, put in your bid today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our goals as parents is to give our son opportunities we never had as kids, for example, as of today, being able to sleep in a &lt;a title=&quot;Christopher's New Bed: Waving&quot; href=&quot;http://papascott.typepad.com/photos/christophers_new_bed/img_0116.html&quot;&gt;bunk bed&lt;/a&gt;.

They're located in Hamburg, so we should get quick turnover. I'm spoiled by the German post, though... I was disappointed that the first DVD arrived after two days instead of overnight. But if the service is decent, I'm sure we'll upgrade to the standard package (3 DVDs at a time for 19,90 Euros).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other German Netflix clone &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netleih.de/&quot;&gt;Netleih&lt;/a&gt; also has a 9,90 Euro deal (4 DVDs per month, 2 at a time).&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/10/15/windmill-front</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What' up on the &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Windmills over L√ºllau&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/09/27/2600.php&quot;&gt;anti-windmill&lt;/a&gt; front? Our informal group organized last week. We named ourselves &quot;L√ºllauer Gegenwind&quot;, selected our neighbor as speaker, and my wife as treasurer. The group printed up flyers to inform the village of the informational meeting held by the windmill investors. They expected 20 people, but 120 showed up (our village has a population of 400), and the meeting was &lt;a title=&quot;L√ºllau: Sturm gegen neue Windr√§der&quot; href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/10/13/217568.html&quot;&gt;written up&lt;/a&gt; in the Hamburger Abendblatt. We've been getting some help from a similar group in Dahlenburg, &lt;a title=&quot;Windkraft mit Vernunft&quot; href=&quot;http://www.windkraftmitvernunft.de/&quot;&gt;'Windkraft mit Vernunft'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group will be meeting with farmers this week to try to convince them that wind energy is not the secure source of income that the wind investment firms make it out to be. We'll be following the situation at the city level (where the zoning situation is somewhat muddled) and the state level (where a bill proposed by the new CDU/FDP government will increase the required distance between windmills and residential areas). We're unsure whether our village is 'residential' or 'mixed used'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll probably let my wife do most of the windmill campaigning, since Christopher is too young to be left alone evenings. I've offered to set up a weblog for the group, but they haven't taken me up on it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learning a templating system for PHP has long been something I knew I *should* do, but had been long put off because I knew it would be uncomfortable, like cleaning my desk or going to the dentist. No matter which system I would chose, there would be some overhead in learning and in rearranging my work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, inspired last week the implementation of templates at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogg.de&quot;&gt;blogg.de&lt;/a&gt;, I jumped into the &lt;a title=&quot;Smarty : Template Engine&quot; href=&quot;http://smarty.php.net/&quot;&gt;Smarty&lt;/a&gt; template engine. And as I implemented my first template, I promptly made my first newbie mistake, namely confusing 'caching' with 'pre-compiling'. I set my language-specific entry page to be cached, and wondered why my site was suddenly only in German. After a slight bout of panic, I checked the docs and found I could set &lt;a href=&quot;http://smarty.php.net/manual/en/caching.multiple.caches.php&quot;&gt;separate caches&lt;/a&gt; for German and English. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew this would be as much fun as having my teeth cleaned. But unlike going to the dentist, hopefully I only have to learn Smarty once, and can then use it for all my little PHP projects.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Adam Curry's Weblog&quot; href=&quot;http://www.blognewsnetwork.com/members/0000001/2003/10/09.html#a4571&quot;&gt;Adam Curry:&lt;/a&gt; &quot;I'm jealous of the vigor and dedication that goes into blogging political and social issues in the states. Believe me that there is no country in Europe as adamant about certain inalienable rights, like free speech. When it comes to that Dave [Winer] is right, blogging truly is an 'american thing'....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're on the eve of the birth of a constitution for a new union of states (Europe), comprised of 400 million people with a single currency. Surely that is worth blogging about. Unfortunately the blogosphere in my neck of the woods hasn't quite moved beyond the stage of commenting on traditional media. In turn, Big Media here is still reporting that weblogs are only used by teenage girls who write about their pets. Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel as if it's my duty as an american to blog the creation of the european constitution, get people interested in the process and (hopefully) the outcome. There's ample opportunity to shape the ground rules and laws that the citizens will abide to.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European blogs I read seem to blog more about US politics than their own politics. We should be talking about Berlusconi, not Schwarzenegger.&lt;/p&gt;

I should have expected that, since readers would certainly care more about the general issue than about my backyard (or even the property value of my backyard). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually finding the organizational effort more interesting than the issue itself. This evening about 30 of us will be meeting and will probably formally form a community action group. I'm wondering, wouldn't a weblog be the perfect tool for such a fledgling group? I'll try to explain the concept to my neighbors the best I can. Do any of you know of basic user documention (as opposed to setup/admin documentation) for Movable Type in German?&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a title=&quot;tagesschau.de : SPD verliert weiter an Zustimmung&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID2381222_TYP6_THE_NAV_REF1_BAB,00.html&quot;&gt;latest numbers&lt;/a&gt; last night on ARD were quite dramatic, reflecting the internal problems Schr√∂der has been having with his left wing and the crest of popularity for Edmund Stoiber and the Union after the Bavarian election. The lowlights for Schr√∂der:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;list-style: disc inside;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in the 'Sunday question', the Union would get 50%, the SPD 27% (Greens 11%, FDP 5%, PDS 3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;for the first time, Schr√∂der would lose a head to head match, against both Merkel and Stoiber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message to Schr√∂der: 'we don't like what you're doing, and it's your fault'. A few weks ago, I didn't believe the ruling coalition was in any serious mid-term danger. Now I do.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're back from Cologne. Christopher loved Phantasialand. We told him that we would be staying at the Dragon City (which he knows from Jim Knopf), since the hotel had a Chinese theme, and he was able to find plenty of dragons. At the park itself, he had to ride the monorail 4 times to see the (machanized) mammoth and dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we stopped at the cathedral in Cologne just to see some architecture that's not part of a theme park. And we did not stop at the chocolate museum. Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;

Now I can answer the question of whether 'Ostalgie' shows trivialize the brutal dictatorship of the DDR with an unqualified 'yes'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did have ex-FM Genscher together with a couple who were among the several thousand who had camped out at the West German embassy in Prague back in 1989 and were allowed to emigrate. The couple thanked Genscher for his actions back then. Shouldn't it have been the other way around?&lt;/p&gt;

It's inexpensive (around 150 Euros), fast enough (4x), handles both plus and minus media, and came well-recommended by the experienced DVD freaks at work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also recommended &lt;a title=&quot;elby CloneDVD&quot; href=&quot;http://www.elby.ch/en/products/clone_dvd/&quot;&gt;CloneDVD&lt;/a&gt; for backing up DVD videos. I can too... 3 clicks and you've got a menu-less backup of the main title. No menus means Christopher's movies start without pushing any buttons or seeing any forced advertising or boring legal disclaimers. Of course, reading in encrypted discs is your own problem, especially with &lt;a title=&quot;The Register: Germany preps 'second basket' of copyright laws&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32869.html&quot;&gt;Germany's new copyright law&lt;/a&gt;. But finding Dee Eee Cee Ess Ess isn't exactly rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day I also bought an inexpensive vacuum cleaner, just to be able use a clever German title for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

Of the 12 slogans they listed, only 2 were understood by more the half the readers, and the median was 25%. A number of people thought they understood the slogans, but actually did not (the Douglas slogan 'Come in and find out' was incorrectly thought to mean 'Come in and find the exit'). The worst undersood slogans were Mitsubishi's 'Drive Alive' ('Survive the trip'), Siemens' 'Be inspired', and RWE's 'One Group. Multi Utilities', to which even a native English speaker can only say 'Huh?'&lt;/p&gt;

Especially when the exploit is announced just as I am leaving work. So do I try to apply the patch from home, or do I wait until morning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I selected apply from home, and of course the ssh daemon killed my connection and wouldn't let me back in. Nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subways in Berlin used to do the same at the boarded-up stations on the east side of the wall, as if they had hope against hope that a passenger would somehow be waiting at the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those stations are open now. It may take years, but hope sometimes wins out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this anniversary, there are some reminders that all that is violent and evil in the world is not al-Qaida. &lt;a title=&quot;BBC NEWS | Europe | German 'neo-Nazi plot' investigated&quot; href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3098064.stm&quot;&gt;The arrest in Munich of neo-Nazis in possession of 1.7 kg of TNT&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a title=&quot;Guardian Unlimited | The Guardian | Swedish foreign minister dies after stabbing&quot; href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1039822,00.html&quot;&gt;the stabbing death of Anna Lindh in Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;. Or, as a reminder of evil in times past, &lt;a title=&quot;Leni Riefenstahl, Filmmaker and Nazi Propagandist, Dies at 101&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/09/obituaries/09CND-RIEF.html?ex=1063771200&amp;amp;en=457e2481312cdf2e&amp;amp;ei=5062&quot;&gt;the death of Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom makes us vulnerable, and free people are always at risk. The 'war on terror' won't change that, regardless if the result is win, lose or draw. Maybe it's a mistake to even call it a 'war'. I wonder, if by focusing exclusively on an enemy that inflicted such a painful wound 2 years ago, whether we risk losing sight of other enemies of our freedom, or risk giving up our own freedom in exchange for a false sense of security, or even becoming ourselves the very evil that we are convinced that we fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet living in freedom is more secure than living under tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;

There was one set of images that got to me most, ones I didn't remember seeing before. As we all have, I'd seen many times the crushing images of bodies falling the hundreds of feet from the upper floors of the towers. But I hadn't seen or didn't remember the close-ups, the zoom-ins of people on the upper floors leaning out the windows and waiving shirts or clothes into the air, trying to grab the attention of helicopters circling nearby, hoping for help. To me these sorts of images are worse than all the rest, the bodies falling, all of them. There is something unbearable about seeing people clinging to hope when, you know, there is no hope. Their fate is sealed; they just didn't know it yet. Those were the pictures that even today made me grit my teeth and twist up my face.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rome In A Day (Or Two)</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/09/08/rome-in-a-day-or-two/"/>
   <updated>2003-09-08T18:09:57+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/09/08/rome-in-a-day-or-two</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our anniversary weekend in Rome was everything we hoped it would be. Warm weather, great sights, quiet hotel, and best of all, we could sleep in (twice!) without the tap-tap-tap of little feet coming into our bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Mama came down with a head cold, so we had to hold off on some of the walking and let her nap in the afternoon. I guess it was her revenge for my coming down with the bug for our weekend in Berlin this spring. Now we're even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome is a compact city with a cheap and functional Metro (note I don't say clean, spacious or comfortable), so it's easy to see a lot with just your feet and a map. Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, St. Peter's Square, Sistine Chapel (yes, Mama did decide to set foot at the Vatican after all), Colosseum, Forum.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised how German my eye has become. I first noticed that half the moving sidewalks at the airport were broken. I noticed how slow the Airport 'Express' to the city travelled, how many people were in uniform not doing anything, and how the conversation in the street was always loud, fast and furious. I'm sure these are all prejudices, to which there is always a little truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was impressed with how the entire city seemed to be walking on the Via del Corso on Saturday evening. The coffee everywhere is good... even the train station kiosk has a commercial espresso machine. And despite the speed of the traffic, if you step onto the crosswalk, it will usually stop for you... or speed around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed ourselves, and we are already planning our next trip. We'll learn a few words of Italian for next time, and we'll bring Christopher along. He's interested in knights and castles at the moment, and he'll go nuts over centurions and ancient ruins, we're sure. We know we'll be back, because we tossed a coin in the Trevi Fountain to ensure our return.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ex-Patriotism</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/09/03/ex-patriotism/"/>
   <updated>2003-09-03T20:09:22+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/09/03/ex-patriotism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The interviews by &lt;a title=&quot;newsrack blog&quot; href=&quot;http://pages.prodigy.net/thomasn528/blog/2003_08_31_newsarcv.html#106255498271319811&quot;&gt;Thomas Nephew&lt;/a&gt; of German expat bloggers got me thinking: September 1st is not only the date that Hitler invaded Poland, but the date in 1990 of our arrival in Germany, a country at that time re-united in currency but not yet in fact. We had a cart full of suitcases, 3 cats, but no furniture, no apartment, no car, and our life savings in a cashier's check. We had only one job for the two of us. And only my wife could speak the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of moving to Germany had only occurred to us 2 months before. We had been in Arizona for a year, following a potential job that never materialized and landing in the middle of the real estate slump (remember Charles Keating?). Someone suggested that it would be a good time for Mama to return to Germany... the Wall was down, and business would be expanding. That someone had contacts with the international division of her company, phone calls were made, and she was offered a job. We decided to hitch our wagon to her star, and she accepted. July 1990 was World Cup in Italy. We jokingly told one another than if the Germans won, we would leave. They did, and we left. We wanted to stay for 5 years. We're now on 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; good in Germany in the '90s, and with her American work ethic  and German determination, she was able to work her way further than she ever could have in the States. And we now have a house and a child, and we just can't pick up and change continents on a whim like we did back then. But with Germany now in a seemingly permanent slump, I can't help but wonder... if we had lived our lives 13 years later, and we were being offered the German opportunity now instead of in 1990, would we accept it? Somehow I think the answer would be no.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/09/02/no-complaints</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The relaunch of my work site has now been up over a week, with no negative comments. And almost no positive comments either. I did work out how to get the navigation bar to work at small screen sizes, using some dynamic positioning in JavaScript. You can try it if you like. The red dot is supposed to stay at the bottom of the screen, or get pushed down if the menus are too long (i.e. if the top of the dot is higher than the bottom of the menus, the position of the dot is changed from absolute to static). It doesn't work yet in Konqueror (the dot is always statically positioned, even if there's plenty of room), and I'm guessing it doesn't work yet in Safari either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The menus are dynamically generated from a simple XML file (originating from an Excel table saved as CSV text) with the buttons created from Type 1 fonts with GD and t1lib (first time I've used GD in production, I was always unhappy with quality before), cached, of course (the filenames are md5sums of the arguments passed to the GD script). If you use Netscape 4 you get a static table, otherwise you see script-less CSS rollovers (using :hover, images soon to be preloaded).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that frames are pass&amp;#233; in the 21st century, but Marketing wants all the elements to stay fixed, and postition:fixed doesn't work in Internet Explorer. A non-framed version is coming. Since I'm paid to be a sys admin, not a web coder, improvements to the site will be slow, but hopefully steady. None of this would have been possible without reading &lt;a title=&quot;Eric Meyer on CSS: Home&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ericmeyeroncss.com/&quot;&gt;Eric Meyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;O'Reilly Network: Cooking with JavaScript &amp;amp; DHTML, Part 6&quot; href=&quot;http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/3770&quot;&gt;Danny Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title=&quot;Jeffrey Zeldman Presents: The Daily Report&quot; href=&quot;http://www.zeldman.com/&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Zeldman&lt;/a&gt;. And, of course, I'm only posting about my work site at all because I'm hoping for constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Unions Short of Labor</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/09/01/unions-short-of-labor/"/>
   <updated>2003-09-01T19:09:11+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/09/01/unions-short-of-labor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is Labor Day in the States, and it is thus somehow appropriate to report on  Germany's second largest and most troubled union &lt;a title=&quot;IG Metall: Homepage mit Nachrichten&quot; href=&quot;http://www.igmetall.de/&quot;&gt;IG Metall&lt;/a&gt;, which elected a new chairman in an extraordinary session yesterday. That the traditionalist J√ºrgen Peters would be elected had already been decided in a smoke-filled room. That he would receive the vote of only 66% of the delegates was a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;almost a diary: Smug for a day.&quot; href=&quot;http://tschwarz.freepage4you.de/aad/archives/000931.php&quot;&gt;Tobias&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Cum Grano Salis&quot; href=&quot;http://cumgranosalis.blogspot.com/2003_08_31_cumgranosalis_archive.html#106235580407051312&quot;&gt;Hans&lt;/a&gt;  (trust me on the links, I can't get either to work at the moment) have already commented on the (ir)relevance of unions in  modern German politics. I can only point to the &lt;a title=&quot;heute.t-online.de - IG Metall leidet unter Mitgliederschwund&quot; href=&quot;http://www.heute.t-online.de/ZDFheute/artikel/26/0,1367,WIRT-0-2040026,00.html&quot;&gt;ZDF archive article&lt;/a&gt; from April 2003 on declining membership in the IG Metall. Of their 2.64 million members, 8% are youth (students and apprentices?), 24% are pensioners, and 300,000 (6%) are unemployed. That means of that 2.64 million, 38%, or over 1 million, &lt;em&gt;do not work&lt;/em&gt;.  (I'm not even counting full-time union and workers' council functionaries...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 290,000 members are in the eastern states, so it is no surprise that the strike in the east for the 35-hour work week failed so miserably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it any wonder that when the unions came out against Schr√∂der's reforms, the Chancellor simply laughed in their collective faces?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: IG Metall also represents workers in the computer software industry. They would be 'my' union if I were inclined to join, and they helped organize the worker's council at my employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;Lilli Marleen&quot; href=&quot;http://www.lillimarleen.blogspot.com/2003_09_01_lillimarleen_archive.html#106245045868991069&quot;&gt;Lilli&lt;/a&gt;, an active SPD member, is also somewhat doubtful about Peters.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In German &lt;em&gt;Kinder&lt;/em&gt; language, the two functions one can perform on the toilet are &lt;em&gt;pi-pi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ah-ah&lt;/em&gt;. This weekend Christopher performed &lt;em&gt;ah-ah&lt;/em&gt; all by himself, twice. And there was much rejoicing, from both parents and child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess because we had toilets on our minds, we spontaneously bought new toilet seats for both bathrooms. You can do wild and crazy things like this when you own instead of rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also took down all the &lt;a href=&quot;/2001/06/30/1490.php&quot;&gt;safety latches&lt;/a&gt; from the kitchen cupboards, since the risk of Christopher randomly emptying the cupboards has decreased to nearly zero. The guard on the stove will stay up for a while, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we assembled some cabinets for Oma. Unfortunatey, she selected the cabinets solely on the basis of price, and they were a royal pain to assemble. If you get plain white cabinets from Obi, the DIY chain with the beaver, do NOT get the Simply 'Basic' model. You'll be sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we took Oma and Christopher to the festival at Hof W√∂rme, an organic farm. Christopher got to ride a horse and a tractor, build a straw puppet, and jump in a hay stack and toss hay in all directions. A good time was had by all, but a bath in the evening was badly needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've experienced this fear, even in Mama's BMW, which can easily keep pace with almost any other vehicle on the road. On a winter day a few years ago on an extremely icy autobahn, we were nearly forced off the road by a black Audi. A month later, we received a letter from the Autobahn police. They had been observing the Audi, and asked if we remembered the incident and whether we had felt threatened. We certainly did remember, and we had felt threatened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard nothing further. But in the land of &lt;span title=&quot;free travel for free citizens&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: dotted 1px;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;freie Fahrt f√ºr freie B√ºrger&lt;/span&gt;, you enter the left lane at your own peril.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, or unfortunately, the exhibition is at the former Erotic Art Museum on the Reeperbahn, Hamburg's red-light and entertainment main street. I'm personally looking forward to the chance to see the plastinated human bodies for myself, and it will be something special to show to my mother when she comes to visit her grandson next month.

   <updated>2003-08-25T03:08:27+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/08/25/conquerors-or-liberators</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember thinking back in April, as the war in Iraq was drawing to a close, that the whole debate in the press how the Iraqis would view  the US, er, I mean coalition troops was kind of pointless. The Iraqis would be deciding for themselves, without the help of western journalists or editorialists, it would be a process that would take many months, and the proof would be in the facts and events in Iraq, not in the words of pundits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in April it was clear that an troops would be in Iraq for at least two years, well past the 2004 election. And I also remember thinking back then that, from his timing of the war, President Bush was handing the fate of his re-election away from US voters and to the Iraqi people. If, say, in the summer of 2004 the occupation is going badly, the Iraqis do not feel liberated and 'better off than they were 4 years ago', if US soldiers are still killing and being killed, Iraq would then dominate the US election and Bush would be like LBJ in 1968, namely toast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also decided back in April that it would take at least 6 months to draw any conclusions as to whether the occupation is going well or poorly. But maybe the American public isn't going to &lt;a title=&quot;BuzzMachine: Bye bye Bush?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_08.html#004514&quot;&gt;wait that long&lt;/a&gt;, according to a &lt;a title=&quot;VOANews.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=AA40140D-FF3F-4B8D-AEB579CA3DBB57E7&quot;&gt;Newsweek poll&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;49 percent of registered voters would not back the president for a second term if the vote were held now. Forty-four percent would support Mr. Bush's re-election....  Only 18 percent of those polled believe a stable, democratic government can be set up in Iraq in the long term. And only 13 percent of respondents said U.S. efforts to establish security in Iraq and rebuild the country have gone well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like the future is now. Or, as &lt;a title=&quot;BuzzMachine: Bye bye Bush?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_08.html#004514&quot;&gt;Buzz Machine&lt;/a&gt; commented: &quot;The war was a success. But the peace is hell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/08/22/stress</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This would have been a stress day even if I hadn't stayed too long at the Blogger Treff last night, getting to bed at 12:30 and getting up at 5:30. I'm getting too old for that kind of silly behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't really been bothered by the latest virus nonsense. Our firewall and virus checkers have done their jobs. But wanting to track all those funny data packets reminded us that our &lt;a title=&quot;The Open Source Network Intrusion Detection System&quot; href=&quot;http://www.snort.org&quot;&gt;snort&lt;/a&gt;database (1.5 GB) was too slow, so I got to set up a &lt;s&gt;new&lt;/s&gt; recycled database machine. But MySQL really does run much faster on a dual P-III 500 with 512MB than on a single P-II 400 with 256MB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Internet provider is abondoning the domestic German market and sold our account to Tiscali. They couldn't match the old price, so we're switching to a local firm that already provides our phone service. Either way, we need to switch IP addresses, and worse, we have to fight to keep a Class C network. Writing a &quot;creative network infrastructure&quot; sounds better than &quot;outright lying about our needs&quot;, but it comes down to the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there's web relaunch that went online this evening. We did the new design on the cheap. Rather than commissioning a web site, we had our print agency  send us screenshots for which the overworked web admin himself wrote up the HTML, despite not having written real HTML in years (and to think I volunteered to do it). It's still got frames, but it has more CSS and almost no tables, so it's an improvement. And I can't blame a brain-dead agency for bad code, so I have incentive to keep making it better. &lt;a title=&quot;Redirect to my employer's site&quot; href=&quot;http://sawworia.notlong.com&quot;&gt;Take a look&lt;/a&gt; if you like, especially if you have a Mac, since we don't have any modern Macs at all for testing. Yes, the design breaks down at less than 1024x768, I'm still working on that. And blame Lotus Domino for the FONT tags in the content frame. I'll &lt;a title=&quot;Clean up your Web pages with HTML TIDY&quot; href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/&quot;&gt;tidy&lt;/a&gt; that up somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Schill Out</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/08/21/schill-out</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I posted on Ronald Schill's dramatic ouster from the Hamburg Senate (cabinet), I didn't offer much comment because I didn't know how to adequately explain the situation to outsiders. I still don't. I've always found Hamburg politics to be a bit wacky. Mayors resign when they win elections but by not enough. Elections get thrown out on technicalities. The local Greens split into two parties over the war in Kosovo. Grassroots parties form on the right, join the government for a term, then disappear. The color of police uniforms becomes a major issue. (Then again, coming from Minnesota, I know wacky politics. I say only Jesse Ventura.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this wackinesss, Ronald Schill is still the most polarizing political figure I have ever encountered. Even Ronald Reagan during my college days in the 1980s did generate as much animosity. They threw eggs at Reagan. At Schill they throw rocks. The news of his departure led to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hebig.com/schill_out/&quot;&gt;spontaneous street party&lt;/a&gt; (complete with riot police). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logical consequence would be &lt;a title=&quot;Noch'n Blogg.: Hamburg braucht Neuwahlen&quot; href=&quot;http://lumma.de/mt/archives/000513.html&quot;&gt;new elections&lt;/a&gt;, but the governing parties are rather desparate to avoid them, since they have everything to lose. They hope to limp along the next two years with a Schill-less Schill Party, with the popular Beust leading a Senate of zeros.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>FreeBSD: Running 'make installworld' from CD</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/08/20/freebsd-running-make-installworld-from-cd/"/>
   <updated>2003-08-20T04:08:38+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/08/20/freebsd-running-make-installworld-from-cd</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sorry, non-tech folks. This is a sysadmin voodoo post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain several FreeBSD machines. When a security alert is issued, the standard procedure is to update the source for your release with cvs or cvsup, then recompile and reinstall the system with 'make buildworld' and 'make installworld'. It's also fairly standard procedure to &lt;a title=&quot;Tracking for Multiple Machines&quot; href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/small-lan.html&quot;&gt;'make buildworld' on one machine&lt;/a&gt;, then export /usr/src and /usr/obj read-only via NFS to do installworld on the target machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my FreeBSD machines are behind a firewall inside a DMZ. I can't mount NFS through the firewall, and I don't really want to be compiling systems on underpowered small-disk single-purpose machines in a DMZ. At first, I used installation CDs to update major versions. This is not very flexible and may not include the latest security patches. Lately I've been plugging the DMZ machines temporarily into the LAN to update over NFS. This is unelegant and may damage the cables and switches (not to mention my fingers) when unplugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, through trial and error (I haven't seen this tip anywhere), I figured out that after running 'make buildworld' on the build machine, I can burn /usr/src and /usr/obj on CD, and then run 'make installworld' from it on the target machines. The trick is you can't just have symlinks from /usr/src and /usr/obj to the CD. You've got to have actual mounts. In this case, &lt;a title=&quot;mount_null (8)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mount_null&amp;amp;sektion=8&amp;amp;apropos=0&amp;amp;manpath=FreeBSD+4.8-RELEASE&quot;&gt;null mounts&lt;/a&gt; work wonders. (Ignore the bit about 'not fully supported' and 'this doesn't work'.) If the CD is mounted on /cdrom, then:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mount -t null /cdrom/src /usr/src&lt;br /&gt;
mount -t null /cdrom/obj /usr/obj&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then cd /usr/src and do your make installs and mergemaster. If you're really brave, you can do this while your services are running (single-user mode is for wimps), and then your only downtime is the reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

He said that 'law and order' man Ronald Schill had threatened to publicly out Beust as a homosexual. 'I have dismissed Mr. Schill,' Beust told reporters. 'I felt forced to dismiss him because Schill's character is not suited to the office.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The two men had met to discuss Schill's deputy Walter Wellinghausen, who Beust also dismissed. Wellinghausen, who had been Schill's attorney, has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor. According to Beust, Schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California and Texas have &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; on us! &lt;/p&gt;

Funny how these articles never mention Germany. I've seen statistics that the number of US visitors is down, but haven't read anyone complaining. The German tourist industry industry seems more concerned with keeping German tourists at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Hamburg is a big tourist town, I've never noticed very many Americans among the foreign accents. Maybe it's because the main attractions are theater and sex (er, I mean, night life), both in the German language.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a title=&quot;Lilli Marleen&quot; href=&quot;http://www.lillimarleen.blogspot.com/2003_08_01_lillimarleen_archive.html#106098011194626655&quot;&gt;Lilli&lt;/a&gt; noted, the US blackout was the top story in the German media today, with special broadcasts, the top 3 slots on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de&quot;&gt;Spiegel Online&lt;/a&gt;, and the whole bit. That seems strange to me, since the blackout is a purely domestic story, but I guess it does come with good footage. The  title on ARD, 'Amerika ohne Strom', was just a tad overdramatic, and a reminder that German reporters rarely venture outside New York and Washington. Maybe for them New York City &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; all of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other theme was &amp;lt;a title=&quot;Strom in Deutschland: &quot;Unser Spinnennetz ist engmaschiger&quot; - Wissenschaft - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/0,1518,261324,00.html&quot;&amp;gt;'it can't happen here', that such a long and wide-ranging blackout is extremely unlikely in central Europe. They didn't really explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it can't happen here, except to claim that the electicity network is more modern, is less centralized, and has more reserve capacity in Europe than in the northeastern US. I did notice that during the heat wave (which broke here yesterday), nuclear plants in Germany, including our local plants on the Elbe, actually cut back on production. This was in order not to exceed limits on the temperature of water they returned to the environment, which in some cases was cooler than the water they were taking in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the reports smugly noted that per-capita electricity usage here is half that of the US. They didn't bother to &lt;a href=&quot;/2001/02/01/1399.php&quot;&gt;compare prices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In Germany, the language we speak in the US is often referred to as &quot;Amerikanisch&quot;, as if it has nothing to do with English. Even better is to be referred to as a &quot;US-Amerikaner&quot;, which even though it incorporates the beloved letters 'USA', to me sounds like PC mumbo-jumbo. I mean, even though there is North America and South America, there does not exist an 'America' of which the US is a subset. Please, just call me 'Ami'!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/08/13/boltenhagen</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we visited &lt;a title=&quot;Ostseebad Boltenhagen an der Mecklenburgischen Ostseek√ºste - Mecklenburg&quot; href=&quot;http://www.boltenhagen.de/&quot;&gt;Boltenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, on the Baltic coast between L√ºbeck and Wismar. It's a traditional seaside resort town, celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, very well kept and with a very nice beach. The day was a bit breezy (perfect for the windsurfing competition that happened to be going on), but as relief from the heat we didn't mind at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, Boltenhagen would be just 30 minutes past L√ºbeck. In practice, thanks to bad roads (er, I mean the lack of infrastructure in the 'new states') and Sunday traffic, it took us &lt;em&gt;2 hours&lt;/em&gt; to cover the &lt;a title=&quot;Staugef√§hrdete Stra√üenabschnitte bei Selmsdorf&quot; href=&quot;http://verkehrsinformation.mvnet.de/stau/stau4.htm&quot;&gt;20 km of 2-lane road&lt;/a&gt; from L√ºbeck to the turn-off to the north. Luckily Christopher held up like a trooper, and the day was not ruined. But all I can say is hurry up and finish the damned Baltic Autobahn A20 already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traffic jam ended in Selmsdorf, the first village east of the former border. Amidst the half-completed housing and the ghost-town commercial park, we noticed a dirt road leading into a gully, with a street sign &quot;Strasse der Freiheit&quot; - Street of Freedom. I wish we had had a camera ready. I guess you can have them build your Street of Freedom, but you have to pave it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

Germany has taken a very active role in Afghanistan and we're very thankful for that. As NATO steps forward, Germany has assumed a big responsibility. And we really appreciate the German participation. And the reason I bring that up is, is that that's a change from six months ago. And not only is Germany's participation important, it's robust, more robust than we would have anticipated. I look forward to thanking Chancellor Schroeder for that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All politics aside, it makes me feel a lot better when the president of my native country is on speaking terms with my adopted country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, if you're a German unhappy with the current American president, you should be happy too, since Germany has a much better chance to influence American policy when they are speaking (slim) than when they are not (none).&lt;/p&gt;

How &lt;a title=&quot;Das E-Business Weblog: Mal wieder: Zum Zitieren in Blogs&quot; href=&quot;http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2003/08/07/mal_wieder_zum_zitieren_in_blogs.shtml&quot;&gt;should&lt;/a&gt; bloggers &lt;a title=&quot;Couchblog: Hunde die bellen&quot; href=&quot;http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/archives/2003/08/hunde_die_bellen.php&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; one another? &lt;a title=&quot;Das E-Business Weblog: Mal wieder: Zum Zitieren in Blogs&quot; href=&quot;http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2003/08/07/mal_wieder_zum_zitieren_in_blogs.shtml&quot;&gt;Should&lt;/a&gt; a quote be immediately identifiable as a quote? &lt;a title=&quot;Das E-Business Weblog: Mal wieder: Zum Zitieren in Blogs&quot; href=&quot;http://www.roell.net/weblog/archiv/2003/08/07/mal_wieder_zum_zitieren_in_blogs.shtml&quot;&gt;Should&lt;/a&gt; a link always be permalink?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally bristle at any rules that bloggers 'must' or 'should' do anything, except be true to their own principles and to themselves. I don't blog to share knowledge. I don't blog to be part of a community. I blog for myself, for my own enjoyment. I don't have an obligation to follow any rules with my weblog, except to please me. So &lt;a title=&quot;Scripting News&quot; href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; is free to edit his posts during the day. &lt;a title=&quot;Der Schockwellenreiter&quot; href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/&quot;&gt;J√∂rg Kantel&lt;/a&gt; is free to quote without attribution. (Although once you read his blog for a few days, it's pretty easy to pick out his words from the quotes, even without the quotation marks. And for all I know, maybe he didn't even invent his catch phrase &amp;lt;a title=&quot;Google Search: &quot;Allersch√§rfstes Willkommen&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;amp;q=%22Allersch%E4rfstes Willkommen%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google Search&quot;&amp;gt;&quot;Allersch√§rfstes Willkommen&quot;.) And I'm free to quote and paraphrase in my Quick Links to get things to fit in the tool tip bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those who blog seriously, professionally, for business, or as consultants, just have to accept weblogs for what they are, namely mostly unserious and unprofessional. You might as well try to herd cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; It's appropriate to add a quote here, from &lt;a title=&quot;Jonathon Delacour: Weblog Ethics&quot; href=&quot;http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/2003/08/weblog_ethics.php&quot;&gt;Jonathon Delacour&lt;/a&gt; (welcome back, by the way), in regards to ethics and blogging: &quot;I instinctively mistrust attempts... to impose rules or standards, no matter how well-intentioned they might be.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A 'red herring' in English is a 'Ente' (duck) in German, at least as far a news stories go. Yesterday's ducks in the German news were &lt;a title=&quot;Sommertheater: CDU-Politiker fordert Verk√ºrzung der Ferien auf vier Wochen - Politik - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,259747,00.html&quot;&gt;a call to shorten school vacations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;tagesschau.de : Politiker machen Front gegen Rauchen&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID2105360_TYP6_THE_NAVSPM11172_REF2,00.html&quot;&gt;a call for anti-smoking regulations in public places&lt;/a&gt;. More interesting, as noted by &lt;a title=&quot;Marstonalia&quot; href=&quot;http://marston.blogspot.com/2003_08_03_marston_archive.html#106002395376554389&quot;&gt;Marstonalia&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a title=&quot;Home - Leute Heute ZDF Boulevard Ber√ºhmtheiten Musik&quot; href=&quot;http://leuteheute.douglas.de/out/58.php&quot;&gt;online partnership between ZDF and the perfume chain Douglas&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a title=&quot;ZDF: Grenzenlose N√§he - Kultur - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,259821,00.html&quot;&gt;may well violate media laws regulating public broadcasting&lt;/a&gt;. Not because of the mixing of public and private content, which happens all the time on the air, but because the mix is on the Internet, where ARD/ZDF do not have a license to operate and thus are competing (which public funds?) with private broadcasters and other online media as well. The Internet activities of ARD/ZDF have always been in a grey area of media regulation, and in my opinion should be strictly non-commercial, given their public monopoly in broadcasting. Selling perfume for Douglas is anything but non-commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Short Sheeted</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/08/04/short-sheeted/"/>
   <updated>2003-08-04T19:08:39+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/08/04/short-sheeted</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, on July 30 to be exact, 2 days before the beginning of the new month, my employer informed us that short time was cancelled for the month of August, that we would be back on full time. Have we turned the corner? Is this the light at the end of the tunnel? Not exactly. One of our projects was having trouble meeting a deadline and needed to be fully staffed. However, the firm was unable to cut enough hours from other projects to continue to meet the legal requirements for short time, so that means thanks to disorganization, we're all back on full time. Short time will probably resume in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my department, which provides internal service and support, that means we have to be extremely productive this month, since we want people to notice that we can accomplish much more when we are at full strength. Otherwise, management might have the idea that we are overstaffed and cut us back permanently. Funny politics. To protect our jobs, we have to accomplish less when we have less time, and more when we have more time, even though the amount of work is constant. It almost sounds like we are working for the government, and have to spend our entire budget this period to make sure we are fully funded for the next period. Don't ask any questions, just do what you're told!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was actually kind of nice having two nearly-fully-paid afternoons off per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher is still asking to see the Springsteen video to watch Bruce slide. Is he too young to be watching music videos? Not if it's &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, too, was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;TypePad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://papascott.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;beta tester&lt;/a&gt;. I didn't look at it that closely, since I'm not looking to replace my present hoster (namely, me). But I did make a couple suggestions in regards to color-blind users. They're opening up to the general public tomorrow, and if anyone wants a 20% discount for 'friends of beta-testers', let me know and say you're my friend. I'm allowed to have 20 friends.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/07/29/life-for-a-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Markus G√§fgen was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatica.com/germanymain.asp?pad=190,205,&amp;amp;item_id=33079&quot;&gt;sentenced to life imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; for the kidnap and murder of the 11 year old Jakob von Metzler in Frankfurt last summer. This would merely be local news, except that after G√§fgen's arrest, when it was still thought the boy was alive, Frankfurt police &lt;a title=&quot;Deutsche Welle: Germany&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1432_A_936126_1_A,00.html&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; the suspect with 'severe pain' (i.e. torture) if he did not reveal the location of the boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court ruled G√§fgen's police confession as inadmissible, and declared that the police conduct had done 'serious damage' to the German rule of law. However, it also ruled that the police conduct had no bearing on G√§fgen's guilt and declared the crime as extraordinary, ruling out parole after 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm no student of the law, but it is interesting how the German court separated the extreme breach of constitutional rights from the criminal case. An American court may well have let G√§fgen walk away scot-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Added link to &lt;a title=&quot;Deutsche Welle: Killer Convicted, Police Under Fire for Torture&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1432_A_936126_1_A,00.html&quot;&gt;Deutsche Welle&lt;/a&gt;, which is more complete than the Expatica report.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Summer Closeout</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't have thought that the beginning of the summer close-out sales in German retail would be news to anyone other than the pensioners who line up   for bargains when the stores open, but &lt;a title=&quot;Marstonalia: German gov't ditches rules on 'end of season sales'&quot; href=&quot;http://marston.blogspot.com/2003_07_27_marston_archive.html#105942176186118863&quot;&gt;Marstonalia&lt;/a&gt; found it worthy of mention. Not that he was thinking of flying across the Atlantic for 60%, but because the Schr√∂der cabinet has proposed doing away with the regulation of such sales. While Marsonalia finds the regulation symbolic of a &quot;German commitment to principles beyond commerce&quot;, most of the German press sees such regulation of retailers as blatant protection of small shops and retail unions and against the interest of consumers. Yesterday I chose to shop in a way that would please neither German retailers nor German unions. I bought a PDA on ebay, well after 8 pm and for much less than retail.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Listening to our local &lt;a title=&quot;Radio Hamburg&quot; href=&quot;http://www.radiohh.de/&quot;&gt;corporate 40&lt;/a&gt; station this evening, something caught my ear that I had to listen more closely. Was the north German teeny band &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.echt.de/&quot;&gt;Echt&lt;/a&gt; now singing in English? No, the band &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deuceproject.com/&quot;&gt;Deuce Project&lt;/a&gt; has covered the bittersweet 'don't you wish your ex would come crawling back to you so you could turn your back on her' song &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letssingit.com/echt-du-tragst-keine-liebe-in-dir-qgb8jwl.html&quot;&gt;'Keine Liebe'&lt;/a&gt;, which they translated as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deuceproject.com/the-deuce-project-lyrics.html#stone-cold&quot;&gt;'Stone Cold'&lt;/a&gt;. Interesting that an American band would cover a German song, and a fairly intelligent song at that. Typical that the cover band gets the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deuceproject.com/images/deucebillboardsinglereview.jpg&quot;&gt;credit&lt;/a&gt; for the text and the catchy melody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Denn Du tr√§gst keine Liebe in Dir,&lt;br /&gt;
nicht f√ºr mich und f√ºr irgendwen.&lt;br /&gt;
Du tr√§gst keine Liebe in Dir,&lt;br /&gt;
Dir nachzutrauern hat keinen Sinn mehr.&lt;br /&gt;
Denn Du tr√§gst keine Liebe in Dir.&lt;br /&gt;
Dich zu vergessen, war nicht sehr schwer.&lt;br /&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not only is this weekend supposed to have the longest traffic jams of the year (thanks to school vacation beginning in both Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemburg), but now 200,000 Harley fans have descended on Hamburg for the final stop of the &lt;a title=&quot;Harley-Davidson | 100th Anniversary | Open Road Tour | Hamburg&quot; href=&quot;http://www.harley-davidson.com/AN/100/ORT/HAMB/en/hamburg.asp&quot;&gt;Harley-Davidson  100th Anniversary Open Road Tour&lt;/a&gt;. And what do Harley fans do when they arrive in Hamburg? They cruise the Reeperbahn, what else? For those of us whose offices face the best known street in the city, on a &lt;s&gt;hot&lt;/s&gt; very warm day when you have to keep the windows open, it was, well, hell on wheels. And the commute home was no picnic either.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the 60th anniversary of the beginning of Operation Gomorrah, the firebombing of Hamburg by the British that after 10 days left 40,000 dead, over 1 million homeless, and scars that the city still bears today. A memorial service was held today in the bombed-out &lt;i&gt;Nikolaikirche&lt;/i&gt;, today a peace memorial, with Mayor von Beust and the British Ambassador. Our local paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de&quot;&gt;Hamburger Abendblatt&lt;/a&gt; has been running a daily series since Saturday on the bombing, but is only putting text on their web site, no pictures. The series asks the question that cannot be answered and is even more relevant today: When good fights evil, how evil can good allow itself to become?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or even start a new meme, like my &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/07/qlinks.php#002426&quot;&gt;joke link&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://entenhausen.blogplan.de&quot;&gt;entenhausen.blogplan.de&lt;/a&gt; last week. After seeing the third or fourth city with a &lt;a href=&quot;blogplan.de&quot;&gt;blogplan&lt;/a&gt;, I thought to myself 'next thing you know they'll put one up for Entenhausen' (the home of Donald Duck in German), and I put up a Quick Link. That same morning, the makers of blogplan &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; put up a map of Entenhausen, giving me &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiesel.h-blog.org/archives/000169.html&quot;&gt;credit&lt;/a&gt; for the 'idea' (do I get royalties as well?), and it now has &lt;s&gt;nearly&lt;/s&gt; over 60 blogs entered (PapaScott is on the dolphin).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I still insist that 'hot' begins at 40¬∞C, but the last couple of days have been 'very warm'. All that energy in the atmosphere has just been discharged in the form of a thunderstorm that chased us from our bedroom in the attic. Drizzle pattering on the skylights might be romantic, but a downpour certainly is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've booked our flight and hotel (burning up some of Mama's Lufthansa miles) for our anniversary getaway to Rome. Lilli &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/07/13/2419.php&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; what we're interested in seeing there. Well, we have a cheap guidebook, so we know what the main attractions are. Mama is a militant non-Cathlolic, so we don't need to see the Vatican. We mostly want to stay outside, explore, and catch some atmosphere. And we'd appreciate any tips like 'If you're in Rome for a weekend, you've just got to do &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A warning for young parents: in the hands of a three-year-old, an ordinary kitchen ladle can become a deadly weapon. Christopher has been on a cooking kick lately. He likes to stir the spaghetti sauce while it is simmering, and to ladle out the portions (under strict and watchful supervision, of course). So now the ladle is his personal property, and this evening he plucked it out of the dishwasher and took it with him upstairs. Within minutes, the bathroom floor was covered with a a dangerous film of soapy water, and the planned bath was cancelled for safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's now playing in this room with &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/10/27/1956.php&quot;&gt;papa&lt;/a&gt; and baby snake. How sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/07/17/common-goals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Foreign Minister Fischer is spending the week in the US (he'd rather be vacationing in Italy, I'm sure), his first visit there since the Iraq war. &lt;a title=&quot;USS Clueless - Common goals and common strategy&quot; href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/07/Commongoalsandcommonstrat.shtml&quot;&gt;Steven den Beste&lt;/a&gt; took the opportunity to point out he has a snowball's chance in hell of patching up German-American relations. I disagree, however, with Steven's contention that the motivations of France and Germany in regards to Iraq can be thrown into the same pot. (And what's this about &lt;a title=&quot;Expatica Germany - Rumsfeld OKs German troops in Iraq&quot; href=&quot;http://www.expatica.com/germanymain.asp?pad=190,205,&amp;amp;item_id=32695&quot;&gt;Rumsfeld wanting German troops in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;? Or was he just wishing for the unattainable?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday morning I heard SPD foreign affairs expert and Schr√∂der critic &lt;a href=&quot;http://klose.spd-hamburg.de/&quot;&gt;Hans-Ulrich Klose&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a title=&quot;Klose: Amerikaner im Irak wichtig f√ºr die Stabilit√§t im Nahen Osten&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ndrinfo.de/pages/info_std/0,2235,OID130742,00.html&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndrinfo.de&quot;&gt;NDR Info&lt;/a&gt; radio . He contends  that both the Europeans and Americans made big mistakes on the Iraq issue, but that whatever Schadenfreude the Europeans might feel, they don't really want the US to fail in Iraq. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ndrinfo.de%2Fpages%2Finfo_std%2F0%2C2235%2COID130742%2C00.html&amp;amp;langpair=de%7Cen&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&quot;&gt;Google translation&lt;/a&gt; of the interview is not quite intelligible, so &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/07/17/2425.php&quot;&gt;I've cleaned it up&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Klose: American presence in Iraq important for stability in the Near East&lt;br /&gt;
Hans Ulrich Klose, SPD, vice-chairman of the foreign committee in the&lt;br /&gt;
Bundestag&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer meets today with representatives of the&lt;br /&gt;
US government in Washington. He will speak with his US colleague Colin&lt;br /&gt;
Powell and with Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. It is the first US&lt;br /&gt;
visit of the Foreign Minister since the Iraq war. At that time&lt;br /&gt;
German-American relations were heavily strained by the &quot;no&quot; of the German&lt;br /&gt;
Government to the war. Therefore Fischer's visit is also an attempt to&lt;br /&gt;
better relations. Questions for Hans Ulrich Klose of the SPD,&lt;br /&gt;
vice-chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Bundestag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NDR info.: Mr. Klose, how you judge the current relationship between the&lt;br /&gt;
USA and Germany?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klose: It's beginning to improve. One must add however, the problems&lt;br /&gt;
between Europeans and Americans are not only attributable to the attitude&lt;br /&gt;
in the Iraq war. The relationship changed after the end of the cold war&lt;br /&gt;
and because America, not least due to the experiences in the Kosovo war,&lt;br /&gt;
has at least partly lost interest in NATO. The Iraq war brought the debate&lt;br /&gt;
to a head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NDR info.: At that time you violently criticized the chancellor because of&lt;br /&gt;
his categorical No to the participation of the German Federal Armed Forces&lt;br /&gt;
at the Iraq war. Do you see that differently today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klose: No, there I must correct you: I did not criticize the chancellor&lt;br /&gt;
because of his No to the war, because I was also not for the war. I&lt;br /&gt;
criticized the chancellor because of his diplomatic mistakes, the fact&lt;br /&gt;
that he specified his position unilaterally, under the title of &quot;the&lt;br /&gt;
German way&quot;, and he declared that, &quot;whatever the UN decides, we will not&lt;br /&gt;
participate&quot;. This political behavior indeed questioned the very&lt;br /&gt;
principles of German foreign policy. And that was the core of my&lt;br /&gt;
criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NDR info.: Now however the the arguments of US president, which at that&lt;br /&gt;
time justified the war, are being disproved. Did he also no make clear&lt;br /&gt;
mistakes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klose: The Americans made at least as many mistakes as the Europeans. One&lt;br /&gt;
can say, the political management around this conflict was deplarably bad&lt;br /&gt;
on both sides of the Atlantic. One of the largest American errors consists&lt;br /&gt;
of the fact that they did not plausibly state the reasons for their&lt;br /&gt;
intervention in Iraq. However, the error of the Europeans lay in the fact&lt;br /&gt;
that many of them deliberately minimized the danger posed by Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NDR info.: The question now is, how can German-American relations become&lt;br /&gt;
closer again. Unofficially the USA wish that German German Federal Armed&lt;br /&gt;
Forces soldiers would engage themselves in the postwar Iraq. Chancellor&lt;br /&gt;
Schroeder rejected this, Fischer also. Was this correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klose: I believe indeed that German soldiers in the Iraq would not be&lt;br /&gt;
useful at present, in order to be honest, because one cannot go into such&lt;br /&gt;
an deployment without intensive preparation. Successes of the German&lt;br /&gt;
soldiers with &quot;nation building&quot; in other parts of the world lay in it that&lt;br /&gt;
they were excellently trained, with the right attitude to adjust to&lt;br /&gt;
certain situations. One does not create that from today to tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps it would be possible to refer to the civilian component. In Iraq&lt;br /&gt;
an entire country is to be developed, from the municipalities to up to the&lt;br /&gt;
central level. And there the Germans could bring in specific strengths.&lt;br /&gt;
And if it concerns a symbolic military gesture to to be made, surely also&lt;br /&gt;
the chancellor and the foreign minister will be willing to discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NDR info.: They have already said, a symbolic gesture is not enough, in a&lt;br /&gt;
country, in which there is so much to be actually done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klose: Correct. Therefore it would be better, that each country would&lt;br /&gt;
bring in the strengths which they have. The principle must be however that&lt;br /&gt;
we, the Germans, we, the Europeans, have no interest that the Americans&lt;br /&gt;
faile in Iraq fail and withdraw themselves possibly prematurely. One can&lt;br /&gt;
formulate: the greater danger for stability in the Near East is not that&lt;br /&gt;
the Americans might remain too long - no, the danger is that that they do&lt;br /&gt;
not stay long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rather late at our grillfest last weekend, my wife and I impulsively decided to head someplace warm and romantic for our 20th anniversary in September, since our day care provider (under the influence of the California red wine, I'm sure) offered to look after Christopher for that weekend. This would be a second honeymoon, except that we never really had a first honeymoon. Our first thought was Rome, and checking the prices and the flight schedules it looks very good. Now, I've never been to Italy at all, and Mama only once to Verona, so I'll ask my readers. What's essential to see and do (and eat and drink) in Rome for if one is there for 48 hours? No rental car, and no hangovers, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually live quite a ways south of Hittfeld, but Buchholz isn't in the Hamburg transit system (yet). I work at station St. Pauli, my wife's office is near Mundsburg, and our first apartment in Hamburg was exactly halfway between Barmbek and Alter Teichweg.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Interesting that the current top two entries on the &lt;a title=&quot;Kultur - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/charts/0,1518,sachbuch,00.html&quot;&gt;Spiegel non-fiction bestseller list&lt;/a&gt; are both American,  namely Michael Moore &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; and Hillary Clinton &quot;Living History&quot; (and number 7 is Emmanuel Todd &quot;World Power USA: An Obituary&quot;, a book I'm not familiar with but the title seems to say it all).  My conclusion: Germans are very interested in reading about the United States, but only to have their prejudices confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We were busy all day yesterday hosting our annual German Fourth-of-July grill party. Lately, however, it has not been all that annual. In fact, our last one was in 1998 (it was cold and rainy, and Germany lost to Croatia in the World Cup)Then came pregnancy and baby, and then we were just out of the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was also cold and rainy, but were able to stay under the carport in relative comfort. We had twice as much food and drink as we needed, except the California red wine. And we ended up at 1am with a heated 3-way discussion of the German reaction to the Iraq war and conspiracy theories on M√∂llemann's death (I was listening, not discussing, on both counts). So I guess it was a successful party.&lt;/p&gt;

So I am rather proud that, without even trying, I managed to screw up my XP installation to the point that it no longer is able to boot (some kernel file is missing or damaged). I think I rebooted while the windows updater was running, or did something else equally as stupid. There's nothing there I really want to keep, so I'll just wipe it out and start again. I should really stick to stable operating systems, though.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;NDR to cancel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndr.de/tv/sesamstrasse/&quot;&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt; after 30 years!?! No, but as of August 4 they will discontinue the afternoon broadcast at 6pm, leaving only the early morning broadcast at 7:30. For families with working parents (like us!),  TV in the morning is not an option, and cutting the afternoon broadcast is as good as cancelling the show altogether. &lt;a title=&quot;Radio Hamburg&quot; href=&quot;http://www.radiohh.de/&quot;&gt;Radio Hamburg&lt;/a&gt; (a private broadcaster, as opposed to the public NDR) has launched a &lt;a title=&quot;Radio Hamburg: Rettet die Sesamstrasse!&quot; href=&quot;http://www.radiohh.de/neu/frameset/sites/dynamisch.html?ID=2974&amp;amp;subnavi1=10&amp;amp;page=info&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; to save the afternoon broadcast. NDR claims that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kika.de/&quot;&gt;Kinderkanal&lt;/a&gt; offers an alternative for children, but sorry, it's not Sesame Street, and it's a raw deal for Christopher. And for his parents.&lt;/p&gt;

Schr√∂der has outfoxed them again. The Union has to say yes, and Schr√∂der will get the credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What strikes me about the budget issue is that the discussion is very superficial. Despite allusions in the press to Reagan and Thatcher, noone is asking whether the state can or should continue to do all the things it has done up to now. The government is cutting corners, not programs. The budget tree is being attacked with a nailfile rather than an axe. And noone is mentioning that simplifying the tax system, cutting tax rates and subsidies such that the revenue effect is zero, is in and of itself a good thing, since it makes rational desicions easier. In the economic sense, it allows me to use my time more efficiently to make money and create jobs rather than to find tax loopholes. Sometimes I think that politicians in Germany are missing some basic economic training. I used to teach freshman economics, and thanks to &lt;em&gt;Kurzarbeit&lt;/em&gt; I have some time. Give me a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What struck my wife was that the picture of the ministers sitting outside in lawn furniture looked just like the midsummer commercial for Ikea, like a tree was just ready to fall on the table and break all the dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This hasn't been a particularly good year for German unions. First they tried and failed to block Chancellor Schr√∂der's Agenda 2010 within the SPD. And now the IG Metall has &lt;a title=&quot;BBC NEWS | Europe | German strike 'has failed'&quot; href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3027948.stm&quot;&gt;called off its strike&lt;/a&gt; for the 35 hour work week in the eastern states, which would have harmonized the work week in east and west. This was the first unsuccessful strike for the IG Metall in 49 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And last year they were so confident. The new leader of the DGB (National Federation of Labor Unions) Michael Sommer promised a new leftist political course, and his support played a large role in Schr√∂der's re-election. The initial economic program of the new SPD-Green government bore the imprint of the unions. But now reality has set in, and in it is clear the unions had overreached the limits of their political influence. Last week the DGB met with Schr√∂der for the first time since they walked out on him (over Agenda 2010). And now the IG Metall strike has been broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Eamonn Fitzgerald's Rainy Day: Reason 1 - Unions 0&quot; href=&quot;http://www.eamonn.com/archives/000508.html#000508&quot;&gt;Eamonn Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; discusses some of the reasons this strike failed (and why it was total nonsense to begin with). But it could be more significant as beginning of the end of the &lt;em&gt;Fl√§chentarif&lt;/em&gt;, the blanket industry-wide agreements that are the hallmark of German labor.  This would mean companies and employees would be able to negotiate more flexible individual agreements rather than adopting a rigid national contract. And unions would be able to truly represent their members in the workplace rather than pursuing national political agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/25/too-funky-for-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hate CSS. And I don't care about RSS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd just like to have an RSS feed that everyone is happy with. (And I'd like to include extra information for my own use, so I can, say, have an RSS file for each entry and archive I publish, and use those files instead of Movable Type templates to generate each web page. But that's futuretalk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after my feed was &lt;a title=&quot;Don Park's Blog&quot; href=&quot;http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/06/23.html#a615&quot;&gt;shamed by Don Park&lt;/a&gt; as an example of funky RSS (and he used another f-word several times to express how he feels about funky RSS in general), I decided to defunkify my feed (starting with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mediagap.org/mt/mt-rss.txt&quot;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; by Alexander Barnes Dryer &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/06/23#When:8:13:39AM&quot;&gt;mentioned by Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;). The result of my effort for now is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/index_xml_250603.txt&quot;&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now my head is spinning, a dangerous condition this early in the morning, and I can confirm that thinking about RSS causes severe brain damage. And my feed is only &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; defunkified, because I still have a content:encoded element because, well, I like having all the markup. So I still don't pass the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thereisnocat.com/funkidator/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.papascott.de%2Findex.xml&amp;amp;mode=funkidate&amp;amp;funkidate=Funkidate Me%21&quot;&gt;Funkidator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This still won't make everyone happy. That's why I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/RoadMap&quot;&gt;Sam Ruby's initiative to create a new common format&lt;/a&gt; is a good thing, not because I care about RSS (I don't), but because it will help prevent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Brad Choate has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bradchoate.com/past/001639.php&quot;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; he hopes will pass the 'Dave' test.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Re: &lt;a title=&quot;USS Clueless - Free ain't cheap&quot; href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/06/Freeaintcheap.shtml&quot;&gt;USS Clueless - Free ain't cheap&lt;/a&gt; (originally mailed to Steven Den Beste, so the 'you' refers to him).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://site-essential.com/scgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=2161&quot;&gt;Movable Type flap&lt;/a&gt; seems to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/news/2003_06.shtml#000845&quot;&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, but that won't stop me from commenting on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a happy user of both Movable Type (for my blog) and CityDesk (for pro-bono work), and have paid for them both. I disagree that the licenses are all that different. Movable Type has _never_ been a free program. You've always had to pay for commercial use. The problem in this case is how to define 'commercial use'... at what point is setting up MT for a private user 'commerical use'? Likewise, a license for CityDesk does not give one the right the set up the program for another user... one has to get an additional license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from the Linux and free software communinty, maybe I'm more accustomed to reading licences carefully and the type of license offered for Movable Type. We differentiate between 'free as in beer' and 'free as in speech', and it's always been clear to me that MT is only 'free as in beer'. Just like the free version of CityDesk. Perhaps it's confusing because MT is a Perl script in clear text, that one can look at and change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Apart cannot 'pull the rug out from under' MT users, even if they wanted to. Once you have agreed to the license and have obtained a certain version of the software, Six Apart cannot change it for that software that you already have. For example, they could decide to today that MT 2.64 and higher are no longer free for personal use. Everyone that already has MT 2.64 would not (and could not) be bound by the change. The change would only apply to all future users, and present users who wanted to update to the new version. (Fog Creek could do the same thing to CityDesk users. If they were to, say, increase the price by a factor of 10 and charge that price for all upgrades to 2.0, you could still continue to use 1.0.31 for the price you already paid.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it looks like the people at Six Apart are being as reasonable as they can be without compromising their business.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/23/cacophony</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Four months ago it looked like Chancellor Schr√∂der was on the ropes, and would soon be down and out. The economy and the budget were in ruins, he was battered  in local elections, he had a vocal but pointless policy on Iraq, he was caught between election promises and political realities, he faced dissent in his own ranks and a united opposition fully in charge of the Bundesrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days it all looks different. Actually, all of those conditions still hold, except now it's the Union that is in tatters, not the SPD. An &lt;a title=&quot;Im Chor der Union stimmt kaum noch ein Ton&quot; href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/06/21/178931.html&quot;&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; (in German) in Saturday's Abendblatt describes the cacophony (a word Schr√∂der was using 4 months ago to chastise his own party) in the Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of examples: This past week the Merkel and Stoiber did an end-run around their own health care expert Seehofer to present a most unsocial health care plan (co-payments for everything! for everybody!). The loyal Seehofer nearly resigned, and the Bundestag debate took place without him. This coming week the cabinet will be considering moving up a planned tax cut, to be financed by cutting subsidies. The mantra of the Union for the past 2 years has been cutting taxes and subsidies, but now that it looks like Schr√∂der is going to do it, the leading figures in the Union are rushing to protect their favorite barrels of pork (tax credit for commuters! subsidies for house buyers!). Bavaria has local elections in a couple of months, and it seems the Union will be frozen in the headlights until then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing like a little policy-making responsibility (the firm Bundesrat majority) to show how much, or in this case, how little backbone an opposition has. The moderate Merkel, the conservative Koch, and the odd-man-out Stoiber are doing a strange dance to work out who is really in charge of the Union. It looks like the music will be playing until 2006, the next national elections, if not longer, and the only one smiling is Schr√∂der.&lt;/p&gt;

InstaPundit compares the 'Jamesian' movement to weblogging. In the '80s I was a religious reader of Bill James' Abstracts, and participated in Project Scorecard (mentioned in the article). I still remember that it takes 5 runs to win a game. And I hear Bill James now   &lt;a title=&quot;USATODAY.com - Red Sox hire 'Baseball Abstract' author Bill James&quot; href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/redsox/2002-11-15-james_x.htm&quot;&gt;works for the Red Sox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It features interviews with demonstrators, VoPos, Soviet soldiers, and widows. It's being rerun tonight (RBB) and tomorrow (SWR) if you missed it. The photo is from newly discovered footage from Leipzig. The girl holding the sign was imprisoned until 1962.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>1953: Workers' Uprising in East Berlin</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/17/1953-workers-uprising-in-east-berlin/"/>
   <updated>2003-06-17T19:06:19+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/17/1953-workers-uprising-in-east-berlin</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been adding some reports on the anniversary to my Quick Links.  &lt;a title=&quot;Heute vor 50 Jahren: Volksaufstand in der DDR :: hebig.org/blog&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hebig.org/blogs/archives/main/001045.php&quot;&gt;Haiko Hebig&lt;/a&gt; has some photos, even if you can't read his German text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 17, 1953 is a date that the powers in both East and West would have rather forgotten. In the East, of course, since it showed that the East German state had no standing without Soviet tanks to back it up, and in the West, since it showed that it lacked the ability, the will, and the courage to roll back the Iron Curtain. As the tanks opened fire, the protesters were on their own, just as they would be later in Budapest, in Prague, and in Gdansk. JFK and Ronald Reagan would shake their fists at the Wall, but could do little else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't help but think that today, as some in the US  are making plans to bring peace and democracy to Iraq and the entire Middle East, whether they again are making promises that they will not have the ability, the will, and the courage to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Here are the Quick Links I collected on the uprising:&lt;/p&gt;

We finished the chicken-and-egg driver phase (i.e. you need a network driver to connect to the Internet, but to get the driver you need to be on the Internet) and the 30MB-of-security-updates phase. We still need to find the printer and audio drivers, install her aps, and make the desktop pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love to give her Linux, but her job as Voldemort requires that she work with tools of the devil like Word documents and Excel sheets. And she doesn't feel like learning a 2nd OS, and I don't blame her.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the celebrations of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/06/11/2338.php&quot;&gt;Voldemort's birthday&lt;/a&gt;, today we are holding the semi-formal garden party for the relatives &lt;em&gt;(mit Erbtante)&lt;/em&gt;. Reception with glass of Frexinet at 3pm, coffee and cake at 4pm, light snack at 5:30pm, and hopefully by 6:30pm they get the idea it's time to leave. Tip for hosting such an event: open the first bottle of Frexinet at noon. The perspective is then much brighter.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Voldemort's Birthday</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/11/voldemorts-birthday/"/>
   <updated>2003-06-11T18:06:30+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/11/voldemorts-birthday</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Voldemort's office&quot; src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/gb40f.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I no longer mention my wife here by name (except as &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/03/26/2136.php&quot;&gt;Voldemort&lt;/a&gt;, as in she-who-must-not-be-named), but today is her birthday. A very &lt;em&gt;round&lt;/em&gt; birthday, as they say in German (meaning it ends with a zero, and in this case, begins with a four), so it is a very special day indeed. Now we've long since decided that giving one another presents is somewhat, well, &lt;em&gt;albern&lt;/em&gt;, er, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://dict.leo.org/?search=albern&quot;&gt;mean&lt;/a&gt;, inane, absurd, daft. After all, we've had a combined bank account for 20 years, so like I'm going to spend her money to buy her something I think she might want. Inane. Absurd. Daft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have to explain to some of her employees, who called me asking for advice, what I think she might want ('well, she likes gardening, she likes reading mysteries by female authors'... as you can see in the picture, they followed my advice), and I didn't think I could simply ignore her very special round birthday. There's always jewelry, you might say, but my taste is nowhere near as good as hers, and I think we'll save the jewelry for the &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/09/07/1875.php&quot;&gt;20-year anniversary&lt;/a&gt; coming up this fall. But that is still spending her money to buy her something that I think she might like. Inane, absurd... well, you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on our bicycle ride this weekend, I noticed that her bicycle is no longer that new. And she has mentioned a couple of times this year that she would like a new one. She can of course choose her own model and color, but I could take the time and trouble to organize the purchase of a bicycle. So I found a carton about the size of a jewelry box, pasted several bicycle pictures on the inside, folded, sealed and wrapped it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it was a good idea, as she proudly explained to her nephew on the phone that she got a &lt;em&gt;bicycle&lt;/em&gt; for her birthday. And tomorrow we'll be going to see Bruce Springsteen here in Hamburg, and that will make us feel 20 years younger. And that's not at all inane, absurd, or daft.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After torrential rainstorms yesterday, we had wonderful weather today for the Pentecost holiday, and we decided to take in it on the Alster lake in Hamburg. Mama wanted to drop in unannounced at a couple of her Hamburg locations... I'm sure they loved having a surprise visit from the boss on a holiday. But once business was taken care of, we took Christopher on an Alster cruise. There was of course the usual commentary on the shoreline real estate (there's the Otto villa, there's the Senate Guest House where the Queen of England stayed, over there is the Tchibo mansion). But just as the captain was telling us about sailing on the Alster (a permit is not required, but you need to leave a &amp;euro;30 deposit in case you capsize), a sailboat did in fact capsize, right in front of our boatload of tourists. The 3 boaters were not able to able to right the boat by themselves, so we circled around and gave them a boost. The mast was broken, so that was the end of their day, and after being rescued by a tour ship, most likely the end of their dignity as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Christopher is in the bathtub reenacting the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/09/banner-ads-for-schroeder</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At least twice when browsing through German online news sites, I've run into the following banner ad for Schr√∂der's reform package 'Agenda 2010':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bundesregierung.de/Themen-A-Z/-,9757/Agenda-2010.htm&quot; title=&quot;Everyone's talking about Schr√∂der's plans. _Here_ they are. Agenda 2010.&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;banner_hfett.gif&quot; src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2003/06/banner_hfett.gif&quot; width=&quot;468&quot; height=&quot;60&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link goes to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bundesregierung.de&quot;&gt;official government web site&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://eng.bundesregierung.de/frameset/index.jsp&quot;&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;). Now, I know the line between partisan politics and government in a parliamentary democracy is rather fuzzy, and it's not like, say, Schr√∂der is sending the Bundesgrenzschutz to round up opposition state legislators for a quorum call. But it's still a little strange to see the government spending tax money to advertise for  itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, I guess the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/&quot;&gt;White House web site&lt;/a&gt; isn't that much different.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/08/welcome</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why, but I've seen little attention paid to this weekend's Polish referendum on EU membership. Maybe it was because of the the holiday weekend here in Germany, or that the result already seemed certain. Indeed, &lt;a title=&quot;Marysia Cywinska-Milonas :: Welcome home!&quot; href=&quot;http://jej.notatnik.net/blog/001009.html#comment&quot;&gt;well over 80% did vote yes&lt;/a&gt;, and turnout was over 50% so that the vote is binding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nice (but for subscribers only) summary in this week's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com&quot;&gt;Economist&lt;/a&gt; of why Poland is quite important. Poland is by far the largest of the 10 new member states and will be the 5th largest member, thus speaking for the other new members and playing a leading role in shaping the new EU. That role will very likely be pro-agriculture (as in subsidies) and pro-US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Germans will have to get over the stereotype that the Poles want to steal their jobs, just as the Poles have to get over the stereotype that the Germans want to steal their land. Back in 2000 I posted a little story of &lt;a href=&quot;/2000/07/08/1306.php&quot;&gt;German-Polish friendship&lt;/a&gt; from my wife's family. Maybe it can be a parable of how Germans and Poles can get along with their old-new neighbor on the Oder.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Feed on feeds</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/06/feed-on-feeds/"/>
   <updated>2003-06-06T19:06:59+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/06/06/feed-on-feeds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Monday I posted a quick link to &lt;a title=&quot;feed on feeds - about&quot; href=&quot;http://minutillo.com/steve/feedonfeeds/&quot;&gt;feed on feeds&lt;/a&gt;, a server-side RSS aggregator for PHP and MySQL by &lt;a href=&quot;http://minutillo.com/steve/weblog/&quot;&gt;Steve Minutillo&lt;/a&gt;. Last fall I wrote that I &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: You May Be Right&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/09/18/1886.php&quot;&gt;wanted an AmphetaServer&lt;/a&gt; instead of an AmphetaDesk. This looks it could be it. I've been using feed on feeds all week now, and I love it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's at version 0.1, and it looks and feels very clunky. I can think of a dozen ways to make it easier to use. It chokes on invalid XML. The layout is ugly. But the main thing is, it works.

One could think that Germans just always like to complain about the weather. I'm more polite and say that they have a narrow comfort zone. (I will admit, though, that most buildings here are not designed for maximum comfort in warm weather.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot, by the way, begins at 40&amp;deg;C.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a mistake going to work today, after the Ascension holiday yesterday. I should have taken the day off like most people. The office wasn't just empty, but seeped in a mood of doom and gloom, as next week we start on reduced time... 'Kurzarbeit'. My department will be working at 80% across the board, which we all find fair, and works out nicely to a 4 day work week. Other departments are harder hit, with some people being cut down to 0%. Those people are certainly wondering if they will ever come back, and if the entire deal was just a way for the firm to get rid of them without a formal termination of employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I should have taken today off. Then maybe I could have had as much fun as I did yesterday, when I took Christopher to the zoo and saw &lt;a title=&quot;Noch'n Blogg.: Elefantenbaby bei Hagenbeck&quot; href=&quot;http://lumma.de/mt/archives/000244.html&quot;&gt;the baby elephant&lt;/a&gt;, or tomorrow, when we all will head to the beach on the Baltic Sea (Mama has a class reuinion, Christopher and I will come home by train). Or on Monday, when I will take my first 'short day' home with Christopher (his day care and the substitute are both on vacation). All of those are much happier prospects than work.&lt;/p&gt;

Simply learn another language... and blog in it!. She's Swedish, and she's blogging in Swedish, English and German. So maybe she'll now learn Polish as well?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mostly Useless</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/28/mostly-useless/"/>
   <updated>2003-05-28T03:05:04+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/28/mostly-useless</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've nevered considered myself to be a 'serious' weblogger, and have never really considered weblogging to be a 'serious' activity. It's just a hobby... it's fun, I've met some great people online, I've had some good (and some not so good) discussions, and it's a easy way to post baby pictures. But it's message, not the medium that interests me (or, in modern jargon, the content, not the delivery system). The technology isn't particularly important. I was doing the same kind of thing in high school with a typewriter and a mimeograph machine. These days you don't have to get ink or toner on your hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was certainly a bit apprehensive last week about heading for a 'serious' conference on weblogs and weblogging, full of presentations on research on weblogs, weblogs in business, and a strange discipline called 'knowledge management'. So when the presentations began with heavy theory of the 'semantic web', my fears were nearly justified (although they did respond politely to my question about semantic methods deal with dynamic humans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the very next round of presentations turned the conference around for me, when Hossein and Maria told about how weblogs are affecting real people in Iran and Poland. How the main themes in Iranian weblogs are not politics, but sex and loneliness. How teenagers are the main age group of webloggers in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These communities, these &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt; were new to me, and it was very exciting to me. I'm looking forward to learning more about them, especially Poland, since they are my neighbors, soon to by my fellow citizens, yet Poland is mentioned so little in the German media (except in Harald Schmidt monolouges). And I'm wondering how we can overcome the barrier of language in bringing together international communities on the web. (Ironically, at the conference I got an email from a provider of translation services who asked if weblogs could be a marketing opportunity. Yes, yes, yes!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other highlight was getting to know some of these 'serious' people and finding them to be very personable. They may be weblogging for their work, but they are having fun with their weblogs as well. Even if all the knowledge management in the world can &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; help you find cake in downtown Vienna at 1 am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, like Ford Prefect writing about the Earth for the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, I'm going to have to update my personal definition of weblogs from 'useless'. They are now 'mostly useless'. And if 'serious' webloggers can enable conferences to take place where so much socializing can take place, then I guess that's OK. I'll be at the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To follow up on &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/05/10/2224.php&quot;&gt;Smoking for Health Care&lt;/a&gt;, it's being reported today that the proposed &amp;euro;1 cigarette tax &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heute.t-online.de/ZDFheute/artikel/21/0,1367,WIRT-0-2048021,00.html&quot;&gt;will not be imposed all at once&lt;/a&gt; on  January 1, but will instead be introduced in stages of 40, 30 and 30 cents. The government otherwise fears a drastic drop in cigarette use and an impact on expected revenue from the new tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's refreshing honesty, albeit a bit cynical. The government would rather have smokers die than quit. Just make sure you buy a few cartons extra before you go.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/27/blog-cred-since-august-1999</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A number of folks (well, ok, two) at BlogTalk referred to me as a German blogging pioneer. It made me feel old, but it did earn me a number (two) of beers. My blog cred may not go back as far as that of Rebecca Blood (April 1999), who gave a keynote in Vienna, but I did try out Blogger for a few weeks later that summer. And, surprise, surprise, the &lt;a title=&quot;Maus Newsletter&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/blogger99.html&quot;&gt;Maus Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; is still in the Blogger database. Just for fun, I decided to publish it (slightly edited for spousal privacy). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not actually the &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Old Times&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2001/09/10/1538.php&quot;&gt;first time&lt;/a&gt; I've rediscovered my old Blogger page, though. I guess I have the right to dig it up evey 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Saturday in Vienna... a beautiful sunny morning, and we're sitting in a dark hall with our notebooks. The title of &lt;a title=&quot;what's in rebecca's pocket?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.rebeccablood.net/&quot;&gt;Rebecca Blood's&lt;/a&gt; keynote, &lt;a href=&quot;http://193.171.60.17:8080/blogtalk/Filer/filetree/presentations/wagingpeace.pdf&quot;&gt;Waging Peace: Using Our Powers for Good&lt;/a&gt;, sounded boring but her point was actually pretty interesting: that we tend to fill our blogrolls with blogs that think and write like we do. She then gave two examples of blogs that go beyond that, that attempt to bring together two sides of long-running conflicts for constructive dialog: &lt;a title=&quot;Slugger O'Toole&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sluggerotoole.com/&quot;&gt;Slugger O'Toole&lt;/a&gt; (Northern Ireland) and &lt;a title=&quot;DialogNow || Open forum for discussing India-Pakistan relations&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dialognow.org/&quot;&gt;DialogNow&lt;/a&gt; (India/Pakistan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always tried to put a wide range of opinions in my blogroll (which is not just for show, it's what I actually read), but I've never taken it beyond that. What are the prerequsites for establishing such a dialog? A passion for the issue and resolving the conflict, of course, what what else? Cross-cultural experience? Being bilingual (when language plays a role)? Or is it just being able to see beyond the box?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As promised, I'm in the back row at BlogTalk, wearing my dead fish cap, next to a power outlet so I can fire up my little ThinkPad. And the WiFi seems to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm skeptical of most of the points brought up by the panelists so far. How can bloggers internationally maintain any sort of meaningful dialouge given the wide cultural and language differences? How can any kind of semantic markup keep up with the dynamic interests and specialties of the people who write the blogs? And why don't they have any coffee at this conference center?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, both Heiko and Haiko are pronounced HIGH-ko, but they are easy to tell apart. Heiko is the one who can't read the map, and Haiko is the one who &lt;s&gt;can't find&lt;/s&gt; never uses the brakes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At work, it looks like things might be coming together for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/05/08/2214.php&quot;&gt;reduced hours&lt;/a&gt; starting June 1.

The state (un)employment office will cover 60% of lost wages for 6 months. That's a solution that's fair and that I can live with, although I don't really have any confidence that things will be better in 6 months, either with my present employer or the job market in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,2273,00.html&quot;&gt;Nokia 3650&lt;/a&gt; cell phone arrived last night, and Mama had what she called 'car pornography' (brochures for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmw.de/de/produkte/automobiles/index2.html?model=5series&quot;&gt;new BMW 5 series&lt;/a&gt;), so we each had our entertainment last night after Christopher was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MT, Time Zones, DST, and RSS</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/17/mt-time-zones-dst-and-rss/"/>
   <updated>2003-05-17T12:05:10+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/17/mt-time-zones-dst-and-rss</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm planning to archive my quick links as RSS files and use the Magpie or Onyx PHP libraries to add them to my montly archives. While preparing the files, I was reminded that Movable Type has no concept of daylight savings time. The date and time of the entry is saved in local time, without any indication of time zone or daylight savings time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set a time zone for a blog, but it's just a number between -12 and 12, and is a global preference. It seems only to set the MTBlogTimezone variable, which gets tacked onto the dc:date field in the RSS template. If you go onto daylight savings time, the dc:dates will be off by an hour until you adjust your timezone. And in the fall you have to set it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may not really make any difference when generating web pages, when I want to display local time anyway, but it does make a difference to me when I archive entries to RSS files. There I'd just as soon save the dc:time as UTC, which never springs ahead or falls back. Then when I display the file, I can convert to whatever time zone I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I installed &lt;a title=&quot;Brad Choate: PerlScript Plugin&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mtperlscript.php&quot;&gt;Brad Choate's PerlScript Plugin&lt;/a&gt;. Then I can use a couple of lines of perl to convert MT date and time to UTC and print it out as a ISO 8601 string fit for the dc:date field. I could probably make this into a plugin for MT as well. But this is a lot more trouble than it needs to be. MT should be able to keep track of time zones and daylight saving time on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dc:date&amp;gt;&amp;lt;MTPerlScript&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
use Time::Local;&lt;br /&gt;
my $mytime = timelocal(&amp;lt;$MTEntryDate format=&lt;br /&gt;
   &quot;('%S', '%M', '%H', '%e', '%m'-1,  '%Y'-1900)&quot;$&amp;gt;);&lt;br /&gt;
my ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,&lt;br /&gt;
   $wday,$yday,$isdst)=gmtime($mytime);&lt;br /&gt;
printf('%d-%02d-%02dT%02d:%02d:%02dZ',&lt;br /&gt;
   $year+1900,$mon+1,$mday,$hour,$min,$sec);&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/MTPerlScript&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dc:date&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Helmut Kohl and Panorama</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/16/helmut-kohl-and-panorama/"/>
   <updated>2003-05-16T16:05:16+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/16/helmut-kohl-and-panorama</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl always had a, ah, 'special' relationship with journalists from the ARD network. He hated them, and they hated him back. So Dr. Kohl was not particularly cooperative when the ARD magazine Panorama wanted to ask him about his DM100,000+ consulting contract with the private broadcaster (now bankrupt) Leo Kirch. But the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndrtv.de/panorama/20030515/kirch.html&quot;&gt;'interview'&lt;/a&gt; could be a lesson to politicians everywhere in dealing with pesky reporters...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARD Panorama: Herr Dr. Kohl, good day. Stuchlik, Panorama, one question. Why did you receive money from Mr. Kirch?&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Helmut Kohl: I have absolutely no intention of giving you an interview.&lt;br /&gt;
Panorama: Why not?&lt;br /&gt;
Kohl: You are from Panorama?&lt;br /&gt;
Panorama: Yes.&lt;br /&gt;
Kohl: That means you have nothing to do with journalism.&lt;br /&gt;
Panorama: But why did you receive...?&lt;br /&gt;
Kohl: Oh, man, that's enough.&lt;br /&gt;
Panorama: For what services did you receive the money?&lt;br /&gt;
Kohl: That I look at your face, and that's enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;
Panorama: I ask once again: Why did you receive money from Mr. Kirch?&lt;br /&gt;
Kohl: I can tell you this. I am collecting money to finance an investigation of the liars and traitors of German unity, in connection with certain activities of the ARD.&lt;br /&gt;
Panorama: That means you are accusing us of betraying our country?&lt;br /&gt;
Kohl: Parts of the ARD and the activities of especially your program over the years. I wanted to tell you this, and you can broadcast it live. Of course I'm accusing some of you of treason, there's no other word for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned: when in doubt, accuse the press of treason! I missed the broadcast, but laughed long, hard and loud when I heard it on the radio.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With all the fuss yesterday about &lt;a title=&quot;'Salam Pax' plays Americans for fools in Iraq - Ottawa Citizen - canada.com network&quot; href=&quot;http://canada.com/ottawa/ottawacitizen/columnists/story.asp?id=5DF6ADB0-BF3C-46B0-B397-813A7E7CDBFD&quot;&gt;Salam Pax being a Baathist stooge&lt;/a&gt;, I'm surprised noone noted the report from &lt;a title=&quot;Salam Pax im Interview - Industrial Technology &amp;amp; Witchcraft - das Weblog von TextLab&quot; href=&quot;http://www.industrial-technology-and-witchcraft.de/index.php?id=P2048&quot;&gt;Industrial Technology &amp;amp; Witchcraft&lt;/a&gt; that an email interview  with Mr. Pax &lt;a title=&quot;VERFLIXT UND ZUGENEWST !&quot; href=&quot;http://godany.blogspot.com/2003_05_01_godany_archive.html#105290098812282414&quot;&gt;will appear Friday&lt;/a&gt; in the Austrian magazin 'Formil' (er, I mean &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.format.at/&quot;&gt;Format&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: Jacqueline Godany has now posted an &lt;a title=&quot;VERFLIXT UND ZUGENEWST !&quot; href=&quot;http://godany.blogspot.com/2003_05_01_godany_archive.html#105299734132849615&quot;&gt;authorized excerpt &lt;/a&gt; (in German) of the interview. &lt;b&gt;And&lt;/b&gt; Jeff Jarvis has &lt;a title=&quot;BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis&quot; href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_05.html#003794&quot;&gt;translated into English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Anon or Non-Anon</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/14/anon-or-non-anon/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/14/anon-or-non-anon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One interesting topic that came up at our BlogMeet on Sunday was whether to blog under your real name or not. The diarists &lt;a title=&quot;Lyssas Lounge - unpingbar, aber lesenswert&quot; href=&quot;http://lyssaslounge.diaryland.com/&quot;&gt;Lyssa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;Frische Texte von Martina&quot; href=&quot;http://frischetexte.diaryland.com/&quot;&gt;Martina&lt;/a&gt; make themselves known by first name only, and thus feel more comfortable posting more personal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One conclusion we came to was that &quot;it's different for girls&quot;, that women are more likely to run into harassment or stalkers than are men. (Does this mean that more psychopaths are male rather than female? I don't think so, but I think the female psychopaths are likely to be more subtle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But afterwards, I got to thinking that it's not really an either-or question. Even if you post anonymously, you still bare your soul. And if you post under your real name, you still wear a mask. In any sort of personal website, you both reveal a good deal of yourself and at the same time create a persona which may be quite than your true person (what- or whoever that may be).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And certainly posting our thoughts goes hand in hand with our interest in reading the thoughts of others. Writing on the web is a two-way street... we want to read &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; write. In our web browsers, we are still social animals, hoping to &lt;a title=&quot;Burningbird: Self Image&quot; href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001188.htm&quot;&gt;catch a glimpse&lt;/a&gt; behind someone's mask, even as we try to stay hidden behind our own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And I think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://lyssaslounge.diaryland.com/&quot;&gt;Lyssa's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001188.htm&quot;&gt;Shelley's&lt;/a&gt; photos have a lot more in common with one another than either does with that of &lt;a title=&quot;Jonathon Delacour: Remembering Audrey Hepburn&quot; href=&quot;http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000914.html&quot;&gt;Audrey Hepburn&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

Nine of us us altogether, and except for Heiko, I didn't 'know' anyone until last night. The group was quite diverse, including two people from the local blogging start-up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.20six.de/&quot;&gt;20six&lt;/a&gt; and a couple of diarists from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diaryland.com/&quot;&gt;Diaryland&lt;/a&gt;, who find it amazing that some of us blog under our real names. Of course I didn't note names or URLs, although Heiko took pictures. I'm already looking forward to next time, someplace quieter where it's easier to talk. (By the way, I never paid for my drinks. Do I owe anyone?)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;F.A.Z. - English Version - 9 May 2003: Health system subsidized with higher tobacco tax&quot; href=&quot;http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FCE-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&amp;amp;doc={E5D029BA-5B5C-4704-BE49-CF1E12F9CFA9}&quot;&gt;FAZ: Health system subsidized with higher tobacco tax&lt;/a&gt;. Smoking for health care may make as little sense as making love for virginity, but the Red-Green coalition is proposing a &amp;euro;1 per pack increase in the cigarette tax to help finance the health insurance system. The package aims to decrease premiums from 14.4% to less than 13% of gross wages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cigarette tax should bring in &amp;euro;4 billion, just 20% of the &amp;euro;20 billion savings needed. So guess who pays the difference? For the most part, the partients, since other parts of the package include raising co-payments on prescriptions (to between &amp;euro;4 and &amp;euro;8), removing sick and maternity pay from the health insurance system, and various incentives (i.e. fees) to discourage patients from going directly to a specialist without seeing their family doctor first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puts the state even deeper in a moral hole. The health minister would like to discourage smoking, but the finance minister needs the money from the tobacco tax. This kind of reminds of the Woody Allen story about his brother who thought he was a chicken. They didn't want to bring him to a doctor, because they needed the eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How To Cook Quick Links, Bork Bork Bork!</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/10/how-to-cook-quick-links-bork-bork-bork/"/>
   <updated>2003-05-10T05:05:17+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/10/how-to-cook-quick-links-bork-bork-bork</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Danger, danger, this post contains PHP code! Also note I've changed my mind a bit and put the quick links below any main posts for the day, rather than above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the qlinks are saved in a separate blog. I'm not sure if that's the best idea or not... I could have defined a category for quick links. But it's difficult to define different entry formats for categories using MT tags. I find using a separate blog easier, then including the files with quick links in the index of the main blog, so the main blog always has the newest quick links without rebuilding. However, using a separate blog makes finding the links for each day somewhat complicated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day can be found in /YYYY/MM/DD/qlinks.inc. I could just include this file in the MTDateFooter for each main post... EXCEPT that I would then miss the quick links for the days where I had no main post. So in the MTDateHeader, I need to check all the dates between the current and the previous post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the index template (before the MTEntries tag at any rate) we need to define some variables to make it easier to calculate dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;?php 
$offset=0;
define(DAY,60*60*24);
define(NOW,time());
?&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since NOW is defined in seconds, we have count back DAYs in seconds as well. The $offset keeps track of which days we've already checked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meat of the script is in the MTDateHeader, where we check each day before the date of the current entry for quicklinks, before we output anything for the current day. For each day, we print a header and include the quick links only if a quick links file exists for that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;MTDateHeader&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?php
  $mt_date='&amp;lt;$MTEntryDate format=&quot;%d %B %Y&quot;$&amp;gt;';
  $ql_date=date('d F Y',NOW-$offset*DAY);
  while ($ql_date&amp;lt;&amp;gt;$mt_date) {
    $inc_file=date('./Y/m/d/',NOW-$offset*DAY)
      .'qlinks.inc';
    if (is_readable($inc_file)) {
      echo '&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;',$ql_date,'&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;';
      @include($inc_file);
    }
    $offset++;
    $ql_date=date('d F Y',NOW-$offset*DAY);
  }
?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;$MTEntryDate format=&quot;%d %B %Y&quot;$&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/MTDateHeader&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we do all our normal entry stuff. After that, we need an MTDateFooter for the current day's quick links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;MTDateFooter&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;?php 
@include('&amp;lt;$MTEntryDate format=&quot;./%Y/%m/%d/qlinks.inc&quot;$&amp;gt;');
$offset++;
?&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The @ before 'include' means there will be no warning message if the file does not exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not particularly happy that I have up to 15 separate includes on my index page. A cleaner solution would be to put all the quick links into an RSS file, and loop through that. I'll do that in version 0.02.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or I may even put the quick links back on the sidebar. Nothing in life is permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/08/short-time</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The adage goes that a recession is when your neighbor loses his job, while a depression is when you lose yours. By that criterion, the German economy is now one step closer to a depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will probably be offered the 'opportunity' to work a 4 day week starting in June. This is not entirely voluntary, but part of the lost income may be covered by the state (un)employment office since my employer is implementing short time to avoid layoffs. (Although paying people not to work makes as little sense as paying subsidies to farmers not to plant crops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm lucky in that my family is not particularly dependent on my income, since I've allowed my wife to become a very successful career woman, and for now her job seems very secure. For most families a sudden 20% pay cut would be catastrophic. But since our first layoffs &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/05/19/1730.php&quot;&gt;almost exactly a year ago&lt;/a&gt;, this kind of thing hasn't been that hard to foresee. Now that we have a workers' council, things are quite a bit more regulated (meaning the cutbacks will be made 'fairly' rather than on merit or on a whim).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the big question is whether this is just a temporary situation that will be over in a few months when business picks up, or whether it's just the latest step on the road to insolvency. Maybe I should take a another look at that article on &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/05/01/2186.php&quot;&gt;trophy husbands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven't noticed, I've been having way too much fun with my quick links. It could be that you haven't noticed, since they are not (yet) in my RSS feed and I don't ping weblogs.com etc. (yet) when I add a new one. Nor are they archived (yet). I'd like to integrate them into the main column, but I'm still trying to come up with the magical combination of MT markup and plugins that will let me format them as I want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date headline&lt;br /&gt;
Quicklinks for the day as a simple list (no title or footer)&lt;br /&gt;
All other posts (with title and footer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; I couldn't do it with MT alone, but with some PHP looping in the MTDateHeader, I think I've got it, at least the layout on the index page.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>SSL and all that</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/03/ssl-and-all-that/"/>
   <updated>2003-05-03T16:05:37+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/05/03/ssl-and-all-that</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One cool thing about my new server setup is that his has SSL built in. You can even see an &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: the SSL edition&quot; href=&quot;https://www.papascott.de/&quot;&gt;SSL version of PapaScott&lt;/a&gt;, but it's pretty meaningless to encrypt a public, static page, and I doubt that my entries will make any more sense encrypted than they do plain. But you can click on the little padlock to see my certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow that link, you'll notice that your browser doesn't trust my certificate. Your browser should be suspicious, since I created the certificate myself, and any Joe Blow can generate a certificate that claims to be from PapaScott. But since I'm using SSL only for myself and not to sell anything, I'm not going to pay money for a real certificate (i.e. of the functions provided by SSL, I need only encryption, not authentication).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSL can be useful for for a my blog by encrypting connections that require a password, like phpMyAdmin or the mt.cgi in Movable Type. I'm forcing those pages to use SSL so no one can go sniffing my passwords and then pretend to be me. I'm not sure why anyone would want to pretend to be me, but any page worth a password is worth encrypting. It's a shame that most hosters offer SSL only as an expensive add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating a certificate with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openssl.org&quot;&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a title=&quot;mod_ssl: F.A.Q.&quot; href=&quot;http%3A//www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html%23ToC27&quot;&gt;pretty easy (although tedious)&lt;/a&gt;, and creating your own CA has been covered by a &lt;a title=&quot;ONLamp.com: Creating Your Own CA Feb. 06 2003&quot; href=&quot;http%3A//www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/02/06/linuxhacks.html&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a title=&quot;ONLamp.com: Distributing Your CA to Client Browsers Feb 020 2003&quot; href=&quot;http%3A//www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/02/20/linuxhacks.html&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; at O'Reilly Network. Or you can just read the &lt;a title=&quot;oreilly.com -- Online Catalog: Linux Server Hacks&quot; href=&quot;http%3A//www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxsvrhack/index.html%3FCMP%3DIL7015&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; (which despite the title, applies mostly to BSD and OS X as well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This afternoon PapaScott moved to its own virtual server, running on FreeBSD and hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapebox.net&quot;&gt;EscapeBox&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin. The DNS change will have propagated by noon tomorrow, so until then you might get redirected to the new IP address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd been considering for several weeks now whether to move PapaScott to a dedicated or virtual server. Not that I need it. The site is pretty low tech and low volume, and doesn't require any great amounts of CPU or bandwidth. I just wanted to be root! I set up web servers on FreeBSD and Linux for a living, and I wanted to be able to set up my web server the way I want to, install the latest PHP if I feel like it, or try out Tomcat. And to able to break things, although I don't expect to break anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001126.htm&quot;&gt;Burningbird's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a hef=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001131.htm&quot;&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001138.htm&quot;&gt;new server&lt;/a&gt;, I started searching around, discovered a couple of hosters that have excellent reviews, and made my choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornerhost.com&quot;&gt;Cornerhost&lt;/a&gt; as a hoster for anyone who does not want or need root.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some things are better left to professionals. Right now I wish potty training could be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the presence of a professional child care provider, Christopher is able to go without a diaper the entire day. Then his amatuer child care father takes him home. Despite denying repeatly that he needs to use the toilet, Christopher walks in the door, pulls down his pants, marches into the living room and proceeds to piss on his play carpet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has the ability. He has the confidence. He even has the stamina. He just doesn't have the desire. And, I suspect, he wanted to piss his father off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing the carpet is 100% polyester.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quick Links</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/04/29/quick-links</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that I've been having fun the past fews days with quick links in my sidebar, a l√° &lt;a title=&quot;anil dash &quot; href=&quot;http://dashes.com/anil/&quot;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt;. It's a way I can archive a link and snap off a comment or two without taking up a lot of column inches (vertical pixels?) on the home page. Technically, I set up a second blog for the quick links with a very simple index page, which gets included here via php.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm not sure if the sidebar is the right place to put them, seeing as there will (hopefully) be a lot more of them than regular posts. One option is to aggregate them into a single post of their own each day (a l√° &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decafbad.com/blog/links/aoeabaofheecf.html&quot;&gt;0xDECAFBAD&lt;a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/23/in_brief_insomniac_edition.html&quot;&gt;diveintomark&lt;/a&gt;). But I don't want to break the flow, if you know what I mean. The other questions are whether I should ping weblogs.com when I add a quick link (probably not) or whether I should include them in my RSS feed (maybe).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week at &lt;a href=&quot;http://windsofchange.net/&quot;&gt;Winds of Change&lt;/a&gt; I saw the &lt;a title=&quot;Winds of Change.NET: Guest Blog: Stories from Germany (scroll to chaplain's story)&quot; href=&quot;http://windsofchange.net/archives/003361.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of German Bundeswehr soldiers saluting injured American soldiers arriving from Iraq, as reported by an American chaplain. Today, I saw the same story (translated into German) on &lt;a title=&quot;Abendblatt.de: Wiedersehen in Ramstein&quot; href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/04/28/153344.html&quot;&gt; page 4 of our local paper&lt;/a&gt;. The Abendblatt reported that it had been forwarded by email to a reader in Hamburg. It's nice to see the story in a German paper, but blogs were faster!&lt;/p&gt;

However, the film &lt;a title=&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; href=&quot;http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/&quot;&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/a&gt; opens in Germany and Austria the very same weekend. Is anyone interested in organizing a group to check it out? I imagine either before or after the actual conference (i.e. Thursday or Saturday evening) would be best. There are English theatres in Vienna, of course, but German would be OK with me. But it would probably be good to reserve tickets. Leave me a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/04/27/2156.php&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;, send me a &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#115;&amp;#104;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#64;&amp;#115;&amp;#104;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;, or leave a note at the &lt;a title=&quot;Bloggers at Blogtalk - QuickTopic bulletin board&quot; href=&quot;http://www.quicktopic.com/21/H/x5bvCiC6qMs&quot;&gt;BlogTalk bulletin board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2003-04-24T19:04:24+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/04/24/schill-and-al-queda</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a new comment to an old post on &lt;a title=&quot;PapaScott: Water Cannons Continued&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/03/26/2135.php&quot;&gt;water cannons&lt;/a&gt; (used by Hamburg policeon schoolchildren), narciso asks about Interior Senator Schill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn't that where Atta's Al Queda cell was. Isn't the discovery of said cell, a key to Schill's victory. Doesn't that have something to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Atta's cell was in Hamburg (his old apartment finally has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/02/19/125834.html&quot;&gt;new tenant&lt;/a&gt;, I read a few weeks ago), but that fact was not a factor for Schill. The Hamburg election in 2001 was held just days after 9/11, but the issue of crime had been a thorn in the the side of the SPD mayors Vorscherau and Runde for years. Schill attracted a lot a media attention as a criminal judge (sentencing vandals to jail time) and critic of both the SPD and his fellow judges. Not surprisingly, he was 'demoted' to civil court and switched to politics, starting his own party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schill made wild promises about hiring 1000 new police officers and cutting crime by 1/2 within 100 days of taking office. That hasn't happened, of course, but crime is down (according to Schill's statistics), and he's done some media stunts like proposing blue police uniforms and cars instead of the traditional green. Just today, he was in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; twice... once for blocking a state contract with the local church (he doesn't like the bishop, and says 'no Hamburger should kneel before the church'), and again for raising the speed limit on certain autobahn stretches. After winning over 19% in the last election, polls these days put his party at around 8%. He does know how to stay in the news, though.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2003-04-20T16:04:09+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/04/20/great-moments-in-tech-support</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful Easter Sunday today. The weather was almost as nice in our backyard as in Florida. One thing I missed while I was gone was a new 4.x release of &lt;a title=&quot;The FreeBSD Project&quot; href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org/&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;, so I opened up the ThinkPad on the patio and set about updating the BSD machine and the ThinkPad itself. Update source, build world, build kernel, install kernel, reboot, install world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything went smooth as silk, but a few minutes after booting up the ThinkPad, it starting beeping, quietly but consistently, every three minutes or so. Had I mistakenly turned on power management? A cosmetic flaw in my ThinkPad is that the battery doesn't charge. OK, that would be a fatal flaw for most users, but I only use the ThinkPad around the house and plugging in to an outlet isn't that big a deal. But power management would complain about a low battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I checked 'ps -ax', but no apmd is listed. I check /var/log/messages... nothing unusual there. The machine beeps again. I shut down X. I do a restart. The beeps continue. I turn the sound volune down to zero. I check the BIOS settings. The machine beeps again. Frustrated, I turn the whole thing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine beeps again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the screen folded down, I see that one of our cordless phone handsets is on the patio table. The battery is low, and it is beeping, quietly but consistently, every three minutes or so.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some blogs (&lt;a title=&quot;BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis&quot; href=&quot;http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2003_04.html#003598&quot;&gt;BuzzMachine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;The Command Post - Iraq - German PM Schr√∂der regrets words that hit U.S.-German ties&quot; href=&quot;http://www.command-post.org/archives/005913.html&quot;&gt;The Command Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title=&quot;USS Clueless - Schroeder apologizes&quot; href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/04/Schroederapologizes.shtml&quot;&gt;USS Clueless&lt;/a&gt;) have cited a &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/wire/World/reuters20030419_155.html&quot; title=&quot;Schroeder Regrets Words That Hit U.S.-German Ties&quot;&gt;Reuters report&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a title=&quot;Kanzler: 'Dann lasst uns streiten!' - DER SPIEGEL - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,245358,00.html&quot;&gt;Spiegel interview&lt;/a&gt;. The Reuters article reports that the interview &quot;is the furthest Schroeder has gone in trying to mend fences with the U.S.&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I deeply regret there were exaggerated comments -- also from cabinet members of my previous government,&quot; Schroeder told Der Spiegel magazine when asked if there were &quot;grounds for self-criticism&quot; for damage he caused to U.S.-German relations.&lt;br /&gt;
The declaration was the furthest Schroeder has gone in trying to mend fences with the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that Schr√∂der's words were nothing new. He's been saying the same thing for weeks now. Note that he's not regretting anything that he said himself, only that there had been &quot;exagertated comments&quot;... also from the US, I presume. The German press is not reporting the interview as any change in foreign policy. Indeed, Spiegel has the interview filed under domestic news, as the main theme is Schr√∂der's struggle with his own party over his economic reforms. The rest of the press isn't mentioning the article at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Reuters' man in Berlin should go out looking for real news instead of excerpting Spiegel articles.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're back in Old Europe, after flying all night. We won't be coherent, though, until probably Monday. The Lufthansa flight was actually pretty good, mostly because the plane was rather empty and the 3 of us had 5 seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did anything happen while we were gone?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Just A Note To Say...</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(Anyone familiar with current children's videos will know from the headline what movie Christopher has been watching constantly the past two weeks.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still in Florida, but have been following events in Iraq via the St. Petersburg Times and occasional fleeting glimpses at TV. When the newspaper headline is all upper case, we can tell that it was a big day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TV critic for the Times, Eric Deggens, had a nice observation about Fox News today: &quot;Roger Ailes... has excelled by capitalizing on an essential truth about American TV viewers: Often we say we want one thing, when we really want another. We may say we want objective coverage, but we really want news that fits our own cultural world view.&quot; I don't think that applies only to American viewers...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll have to see if I can pick up that Kagan book that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ahawkins.org/comments.php?id=P1064_0_1_0&quot;&gt;Alwin Hawkins recommended&lt;/a&gt; before we leave. The Times had a good review of the book and an Op-Ed by him as well (Kagan, not Hawkins).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rockaway Beach</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/04/04/rockaway-beach</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not hard, not far to reach&lt;br /&gt;
We can hitch a ride to Rockaway Beach&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, we are at Indian Rocks Beach, just south of Clearwater, Florida. Luckily they don't &quot;blast out the disco on the radio&quot; like in the Ramones song. Sunny, quiet, and connected, thanks to a $10 one-month account at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.budgetd√≠alup.com&quot;&gt;Budget Dialup&lt;/a&gt;, which is working more reliably than the big-time provider Mama uses to dial into her employer's VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to get a pre-paid card for my spare cellphone (Motorola Timeport, cost &amp;euro;13 used)  for the two weeks, but US cellular service is so expensive and confusing, I think I'll just pay the roaming charges for my German provider for the few times I'm going to call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the WiFi on the Lufthansa flight was out of service, although they offered plain-old-ethernet. Mama used up her battery reading her mail at work, and they only offered electrical sockets in business and first class. Sitting in economy with a three-year-old is not a optimal environment for using a notebook anyway. Despite the fears of World Wide Klein, Lufthansa did not lose any of our luggage, but we only had two suitcases.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2003-03-30T20:03:50+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/03/30/childrens-stories</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been refraining from commenting on the war since it started, since I'm assuming that 90% of what the media is reporting is wrong and I don't know which 10% is right. And frankly, at 7 pm when I have the choice between the nightly news on ZDF and Christopher's favorite cartoon on the Kinderkanal, I know which one we pick. I would appreciate some simple stories like the ones &lt;a title=&quot;Bj√∏rn St√¶rk blog&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bearstrong.net/warblog/000138.html&quot;&gt;Bj√∏rn St√¶rk&lt;/a&gt; mentioned from a newspaper in Norway, &quot;without that compulsive need to put everything in perspective. Perspective is fine, but worthless unless you have something to, you know, &lt;em&gt;put in perspective&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Perhaps another reason is that I've been mentally on vacation for the past two weeks, even though we don't leave until Wednesday. We'll be spending two weeks on the Gulf coast in Florida, in the shadow of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centcom.mil/aboutus/centcom.htm&quot;&gt;US Central Command&lt;/a&gt;. I imagine it will be one of the safest places on earth.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Der Brand: Weapon, Strategy</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/03/27/der-brand-weapon-strategy/"/>
   <updated>2003-03-27T04:03:37+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/03/27/der-brand-weapon-strategy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm about 1/3 through reading &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon.de: Detailseite: Der Brand. Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940-1945.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3549071655/qid=1048739482/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_2_1/302-0079855-0700062&quot;&gt;Der Brand&lt;/a&gt;, the historical account of 'Germany in the bombing war 1940-1945'. I've finished the first two sections entitled 'Waffe' and 'Strategie'. Since a couple of readers have mentioned that they will be reading it as well, I'll give my impressions so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book looks at the bombing from the point of view of the civilian victims on the ground, the 500,000 dead and 30 million homeless. Most of them were not in Hamburg and Dresden, but in middle sized cities throughout Germany, in bombing raids that made no headlines but killed a few hundred people each night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is such a view of any value today? Does it have any meaning for non-historians to look at the 'victims' that belonged to an aggressor nation? I think yes. First, this is the gestation of modern Germany, the hour before 'Hour Null'. The earliest pictures of post-war Germany tend to be the &lt;em&gt;Trummerfauen&lt;/em&gt;, the women carrying away the rubble in the cities by hand. We don't see what created the rubble, and what those women endured before it was safe enough to begin the cleanup. I think it's important to know that to understand Germany's view of itself and its place in Europe and the world today, what ties to the past were shattered by the bombs and what ties remained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, by today's standards we distinguish between 'regime' and 'civilians', at least we try, and today's weapon technology is capable of that to some degree. The weapons of 60 years ago were not as selective. Success was dropping a bomb within two miles of target, and success rates were 30% or less, with 5% loss of aircraft and crews for each raid (as long as the German air defense still existed). Those weapons were not precise enough to target only a factory or a railway station. A neighborhood was as precise as they could get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bombing of civilian neighborhoods had the military objectives of causing economic collapse through millions of homeless and shortage of factory workers, and of demoralizing the civilian population. Neither objective was achieved. Was the bombing of German cities a war crime? I don't think that this is a question that can be answered today. We cannot apply today's standards to the actions of a generation and a half ago. And victors, by definition, are never tried for war crimes. I am, however, very glad that I do not have to make the difficult decisions that Churchill and the Allied military leaders of the time had to make. I'm not sure I'd be able to sleep nights, no matter what I chose.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Water Cannons Continued</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/03/25/2134.php&quot;&gt;police action from Monday&lt;/a&gt; appears in a better light. The police apparently warned demonstrators for 20 minutes that water cannons would be used before breaking up the protest. The &lt;a title=&quot;Sch√ºler-Demo: Erste Anzeigen&quot; href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2003/03/26/138306.html&quot;&gt;Abendblatt&lt;/a&gt; reports that only two official complaints of police misconduct have been filed. Meanwhile, official investigations have been launched... both into the police action itself, and whether teachers encouraged students to skip school and participate in the protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One still has to wonder... throughout Germany there have been massive, peaceful student protests against the war. Only in Hamburg did the protests turn violent. Can you tell us why, Senator 'Law-and-Order' Schill?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The pop duo t.A.T.u. performed on &quot;Wetten Dass&quot; on Saturday, and kissed rather passionately on stage. ZDF turned the cameras away... because of the war in Iraq!

And the mood of the broadcast was set by the war. We wanted everything to be somewhat 'softer'.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note the use of the 'New German' term 'softer' by the spokesman. As is usually the case with English words inserted directly into a German sentence, I have no idea what it's supposed to mean.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>27 Hours Berlin</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/03/24/27-hours-berlin</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're back. Christopher loved it. I would have been better off staying home in bed, but I then would have been home alone with Christopher, so rest and recuperation was not an option. Since I was pretty much a wet blanket, I'll try to tell about our visit from Christopher's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding the Inter City Express from Hamburg to Berlin was the main highlight, of course. Riding in a taxi from Bahnhof Zoo to the hotel was also an new and exciting experience. That night from his bed in Mama's room he could see the taxi stand in front of the hotel, and count the taxis as they came and went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal Saturday afternoon was Potsdamer Platz, with the obligatory McDonald's visit. Chistopher was impressed by an elephant poster at the Imax theater. It was on a set of exit doors, and people would walk &lt;em&gt;through the elephants&lt;/em&gt; on their way out. We had to do that ourselves, of course. We did some light shopping, and we bought Christopher a book. We met Mama's cousin for a early dinner at Tony Roma's. Christopher was impressed by the attention from the wait staff and ran up and down the stairs and through the aisles. We had no plans for the evening, which is good since I went to bed before Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning we drove to Potsdam to see Sanssouci Park and the New Palace. There were a lot of parents with small children walking through the grounds. Christopher was impressed by the castle (he got to stand inside one of the old guardposts), but was just as impressed by the gravel on the walkways. At one point he gathered some stones, and piled them together to start a 'fire'. I doubt that the park officials would have been impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama's meetings started at 1 pm, so Christopher and I spent the afternoon riding the S-Bahn and eating ice cream at Alexanderplatz. Each time I'm in Berlin I keep hoping that the Alex has been restored as a vibrant city center, and each time I'm disappointed. But they still have the funky world clock with the solar system, and, of course, the TV tower. We then headed back to Bahnhof Zoo to catch the ICE back to Hamburg and arrived home exhausted. I went back to the doctor today, and I won't inflict myself on my colleagues at work until at least Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in bed, but feeling better. The wi-fi reception is good and I can read about the news in Iraq without having to endure the droning TV coverage. The prescription was my first experience with 'aut idem'. My doctor prescribed Ciprobeta, but the pharmacist didn't have that brand in stock and asked if she could substitute Ciprohexal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to get well by Saturday, since Christopher and I are taking the ICE train to Berlin! Mama has a one day break between meetings, and she has invited us to her luxury hotel suite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZDF has just admitted that they have nothing new to report, but they continue to broadcast their special report anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some of the students quoted in the Spiegel Online article (also on p 46 of this week's print edition) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,240473,00.html&quot;&gt;exchange students in the US&lt;/a&gt; that I &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/03/17/2125.php&quot;&gt;posted on earlier&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a title=&quot;TASTE - Presse-Infos&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tastenet.de/spiegel.html&quot;&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. Their comments were taken out of context, and they are in fact having a great time during their school year in the States. And Der Spiegel is apparently suffering from an extreme bout of anti-Americanism.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As is befitting my mood on the pending war in Iraq, I've starting reading &lt;a title=&quot;Der Brand. Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940-1945&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3549071655&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Der Brand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (The Fire), the account by historian J√∂rg Friedrich of the Allied bombing of German cities in World War II (&lt;a title=&quot;Germans Revisit War's Agony, Ending a Taboo&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/15/international/europe/15DRES.html&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; this past weekend in the NY Times). The book has been controversial outside Gemany for supposedly &lt;a title=&quot;A cure for amnesia&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theage.com.au/handheld/articles/2003/03/15/1047583738545.htm&quot;&gt;implying&lt;/a&gt; that the bombing of German cities was a war crime. I'm going to try to judge for myself. It's heavy, slow reading. I hope I make it to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Almost lost in the international news, the Federal Constitional Court in Karlsruhe &lt;a title=&quot;ABCNEWS.com : Germany Throws Out Bid to Outlaw Party&quot; href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/wire/World/ap20030318_595.html&quot;&gt;threw out the government's case&lt;/a&gt; to outlaw the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party. After being &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/01/23/115.php&quot;&gt;stalled for over a year&lt;/a&gt;, the case was tossed out on a rather significant technicality, namely that at least 30 of the party's 200 national and state leaders were paid police informants. It was thus impossible to for the court determine how much of the party's activities were instigated by informers for the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Schilly and the state ministries are pinning the blame on each other. In the end, the various ministries didn't know about the other's informants. Federalism doesn't work if you don't talk to one another. And the NDP lives on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mobbing Against German Exchange Students in the USA</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seeing as my wife and I met as exchange students in high school, I had to check out the Spiegel Online article on &lt;a title=&quot;Sch√ºleraustausch: Ganz r√ºde Anmache - UniSPIEGEL - SPIEGEL ONLINE&quot; href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,240473,00.html&quot;&gt;mobbing against German exchange students&lt;/a&gt;. They interviewed several German students in rural America who have met hostility to Germany's and their own personal anti-war beliefs. Back in 1980 Mama was branded as a 'Pinko Commie' by her high school classmates, and I think she still has the T-shirt they gave her to prove it. And she was reminded about Nazis as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an exchange student, your mission is not to teach about your home country, but to listen and learn, about your guest country, and, more importantly, about yourself. The political situation and the media frenzy around it make the situation more tense than we had to deal with 20 years ago, but there are assholes to deal with in any situation. Especially when Europe and the US seem to be drifting apart, the experiences of exchange students are more important than ever. Finding a spouse at the same time is a side benefit reserved for a select few.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're in the middle of a hard month here. Mama has multi-night business trips every week in March (normal is one per month), and that makes neither of us happy. And Christopher least of all. So tonight, when Mama returned from 3 days in Munich, we together with Oma celebrated with a trip to the bistro, with &lt;em&gt;Apfelschorle&lt;/em&gt; (apple juice spritzer), pizza, and ice cream. Actually, Christopher calls all golden-colored fizzy beverages &lt;em&gt;Apfelschorle&lt;/em&gt;, so Mama and I took the beer &lt;em&gt;Apfelschorle&lt;/em&gt; and let him take the juice &lt;em&gt;Apfelschorle&lt;/em&gt;. And Christopher was struggling to keep his eyes open after the pizza, so we decided to save the ice cream for tomorrow. On the way home, Christopher kept muttering &quot;Tolle Apfelschorle&quot; (toll=super or great), so I guess he enjoyed himself. And I'll wait until at least tomorrow to write anything more about international politics.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Illegal Exports</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/03/12/illegal-exports/"/>
   <updated>2003-03-12T07:03:58+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/03/12/illegal-exports</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Amiland&quot; href=&quot;http://amiland.blogspot.com/2003_03_09_amiland_archive.html#90560880&quot;&gt;Amiland&lt;/a&gt; cites a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.welt.de/data/2003/03/12/51035.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;  from &lt;em&gt;Die Welt&lt;/em&gt; on illegal exports by German firms to Iraq. But he draws the wrong conclusion. This does not support the den Beste &lt;a href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/01/Supposetherewastreachery.shtml&quot;&gt;speculation&lt;/a&gt; that covering up illegal exports might be a motive for  German opposition to the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dozens of cases of illegal exports have been uncovered by German prosecutors. If the German government is trying to cover up these exports, why haven't the prosecutors been muzzled. They are, after all, very sensitive to political pressure, as was shown in the case of Helmut Kohl and the &quot;black suitcase&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Kohl, if there were government collusion with illegal exporters, it would have had to have begun well before the German regime change in 1998. That means all 4 major political parties would have had to have known about it and cooperated. Seeing as even arms exports to allies is a senstive political topic, and the extremely pro-US course of the Kohl government, this is very difficult to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if a goverment can be blamed for the illegal actions of business, then the United States is as much to blame, as the second leading illegal supplier to Iraqi weapons programs (according to the leaked Iraqi report to the UN). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the illegal exports simply prove once again the econimc truism that boycotts are never effective. If you have the goods, a willing seller, and a willing buyer, a transaction is going to take place, illegal or not, whether the goods are illegal drugs or illegal missile parts. German firms may be particularly amoral, and thus particularly willing to sell, but there is no deeper conclusion to be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Mrs. T says that &lt;a href=&quot;http://6th_international.blogspot.com/2003_03_09_6th_international_archive.html#90560909&quot;&gt;it's all a plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/03/10/gonzo-gardening</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't do garden work. If Mama wants to bring peace and beauty to her little corner of the world, and she benefits from the quiet satisfaction that it brings, well, she's welcome to it. But that's not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll do garden work if it's destructive in nature. Mowing the lawn is just slightly destructive. I actually hate it... I suspect Mama keeps planting obstacles in the lawn just to annoy me. Raking leaves, on the other hand, is not destructive at all. It's just pointless, since the leaves keep coming back, until it's late winter, and the remaining leaves from fall are clumped together in a slimy mess. Only then does it make sense to gather leaves, and it's much easier as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compost is a fine destructive activity, although the decomposition of organic material is much too slow to gain any immediate satisfaction from it. In the meantime, it's not just a slimy mess, but a smelly slimy mess infested by various creepy crawly creatures of the night. We used to rigorously deposit our food scraps on the compost pile. We now leave them for the county landfill, along with the rest of our trash. They decompose there just as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past weekend we engaged in an extremely satisfying and destructive garden activity (that doesn't even involve a roto-tiller), namely trimming the wild roses. Wild roses grow like weeds, a meter or two each year, so you can trim them down to the roots and they'll still come back as happy and thorny as ever. So you can pick an arbitrary height (say, 30 cm), trim all branches that extend any higher, plus  any others that you don't like the look of. That's the quick, fun part. The slow, tedious part is gathering and cutting up the thorny branches. Since we don't have the ultimate plaything for destructive gardeners, a shredder, we have to cut the branches down to a portable size and haul them away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouch, I see I still have a thorn in one of my knuckles. The roses are still exacting their revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Call me gruesome, but when I heard yesterday that &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/04/obit.buchholz.ap/&quot;&gt;the actor Horst Buchholz had died&lt;/a&gt;, my first thought was the hope that the frantic Billy Wilder comedy &lt;a title=&quot;One, Two, Three (1961)&quot; href=&quot;http://us.imdb.com/Title?0055256&quot;&gt;One, Two, Three (1961)&lt;/a&gt;, starring Buchholz and James Cagney, would be televised. Sure enough, it's showing right now on BR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, the film mostly stars Cagney, as a hyperactive Coca-Cola executive in post-war pre-Wall Berlin. For example, he's trying to close a deal with the Russians. They offer him a Cuban cigar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We made a deal with Castro. He sends us cigars, we send him missiles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You're being cheated! This cigar is badl!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;So are the missiles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll have to see the movie yourself to know how Cagney &quot;learns umlauts&quot; with his German secretary. Sitzen machen!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/03/05/the-end-of-consensus</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Gerhard Schr√∂der was first elected Chancellor 5 years ago, the lynchpin of his economic strategy was the &lt;em&gt;B√ºndnis f√ºr Arbeit&lt;/em&gt;, or Alliance for Jobs, meetings of top officials from industry and labor moderated by the Chancellor that would reach consensus on the measures needed for economic reform in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those five years, the Alliance for Jobs has sputtered off and on, mostly off, as industry and labor accused one another of sabotaging the talks. This winter Schr√∂der tried to revive the Alliance, but after a preliminary meeting Monday he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1430_A_792300_1_A,00.html&quot;&gt;declared the Alliance for Jobs for dead&lt;/a&gt;, and that he would present his own proposals for economic reform in an address on March 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be a significant move by Schr√∂der to move away from the unions and show real leadership, a sign that he is willing to work together with opposition to pull Germany out of its economic crisis. Or it may be just a lot of hot air. But in case the change is for real, it has now begun.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a response to &lt;a title=&quot;www.AndrewSullivan.com - Daily Dish&quot; href=&quot;http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2003_03_02_dish_archive.html#90403215&quot;&gt;Andrew Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, Amiland today reminded that whatever Schr√∂der's policy on Iraq is today, two years ago he &lt;a title=&quot;Amiland: German Abdication&quot; href=&quot;http://amiland.blogspot.com/2003_03_02_amiland_archive.html#90110867&quot;&gt;put his own government on the line to support Enduring Freedom&lt;/a&gt;.  That reminded me of the remark by &lt;a title=&quot;Talking Points Memo: February 12th, 2003&quot; href=&quot;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/feb0302.html#021203317am&quot;&gt;Joshua Micah Marshall&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago that the US routed around NATO when it came to Enduring Freedom, invoking Article V but not asking for anythng of substance. They probably thought at the time that it wasn't worth the bother to wait for the NATO allies. I can't help but think that today there would be a common trans-Atlantic position on Iraq if NATO had been on board in Afghanistan from the start two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I'm wary of Sullivan's broad historical generalization of German foreign policy (&quot;they veer from extreme romantic militarism to romantic pacifism&quot;), since the Federal Republic has only had an foreign policy since November 1989, after going decades without. I don't see the connection to  ghosts of the German past.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't really have a proposal ready for my &lt;a title=&quot;BlogTalk - A European Weblog-Conference&quot; href=&quot;http://blogtalk.net/&quot;&gt;BlogTalk&lt;/a&gt; paper on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/02/11/2098.php&quot;&gt;warblogs for Euro-weenies&lt;/a&gt;, but since today is the deadline for proposals I threw together what I had and sent it in. I was heartened to see that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/&quot;&gt;J√∂rg Kantel&lt;/a&gt; submitted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2003/02/28.html#00577&quot;&gt;&quot;a bunch of unconnected notes&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which I bet I can match in unconnectedness. (Then again he's a keynote speaker, and I was just invited to make a proposal.) I did manage to quote a line from &lt;a title=&quot;Lost in time, and lost in space, and meaning&quot; href=&quot;http://www.rockyhorror.com/&quot;&gt;Rocky Horror Picture Show&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm not sure if I should do the whole thing in a Rocky Horror theme, or just include random film quotes (the scorpion line from Lawrence of Arabia &lt;a title=&quot;Thy mother mated with a scorpion!&quot; href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/003043.html&quot;&gt;mentioned today&lt;/a&gt; on vowe.net would be fitting as well). But I guess the proposal has to be accepted first.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Time Shift</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher has apparently decided he doesn't like staying up late anymore, and has unilaterally changed his sleep schedule. His routine has now shifted by 90 minutes, so instead of going to sleep at 9 and waking up at 7, he now goes to sleep at 7:30 and wakes up at 5:30. It's like he's now 2 time zones ahead of us, and as you can imagine this has thoroughly confused our morning routine. We've been getting up at 5:30 anyway, so it's not like we're having to get up earlier. It's just that we were used to peace and quiet in the morning. No longer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>You're So Vain</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I left my car at the garage for an inspection and tune-up, and took the bus and train to work. On the way back last night, in the S-Bahn line S3, 4 teenage girls boarded and sat near me, talking and giggling the way teenage girls do, making it impossible not to overhear their conversation. They were wearing headscarves, and they were probably Turkish, but they spoke German. They were making making fun of one of their number whose silk scarf had a crease running from ear to ear.  &quot;It's so slippery,&quot; she tried to defend herself. &quot;I had to pin it to my hair to keep in from slipping down on my face,&quot; and burst into giggles. And I had to smile myself. Wearing a headscarf to be modest doesn't mean you don't care how you look. Especially if you're a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/02/23/hast-du-etwas-zeit-fuer-mich</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's probably a sign of my age, or least of when I started taking a interest in German popular culture, that I noticed the &lt;a title=&quot;20 Jahre Nena-Nena Feat.Nena&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006LWT0&quot;&gt;20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; album by Nena, consisting of new versions of most of her '80s hits, and thus entitled 'Nena feat. Nena'.  She still has the unique voice I'd follow almost anywhere, and the new version of &lt;em&gt;Leuchtturm&lt;/em&gt; is quite good and has gotten some radio airplay, so I impulsively picked up the CD yesterday. &lt;em&gt;99 Luftballons&lt;/em&gt; doesn't cut it as a ballad, the duets with Kim Wilde and Udo Lindenburg are a bit bizarre, and she ruined my favorite Nena song &lt;em&gt;Nur getr√§umt&lt;/em&gt; (but then again, so did Bl√ºmchen, or maybe the song isn't as good as I remember). But I'd forgotten how much I liked &lt;em&gt;Fragezeichen&lt;/em&gt;, and all in all it's a nice nostalgia trip back to the '80s. To counteract the nostalgia, I also bought the &lt;a title=&quot;200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006LJ79&quot;&gt;t.A.T.u.&lt;/a&gt; album, which is in fact better than I expected, even though I'm too old to be listening to teenie girl groups, even (or especially) if they are from Russia. But then it's produced the old producer of Frankie Goes To Hollywood, so it's really '80s retro. Sigh. There's no escape.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>At The Circus</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/02/23/at-the-circus</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our entertainment today was the &lt;a title=&quot;Circus Geschwister Rogall Artistik und Akrobatik aus Berlin&quot; href=&quot;http://www.circus-rogall.de/&quot;&gt;Circus Rogall&lt;/a&gt;, a small family circus that was playing in Jesteburg. Christopher was skeptical at first, but he did enjoy the clown and the horses, as well as the popcorn. I was impressed by the admission price (double the price of a movie ticket), but also by the versatility of the troupe. Five performers put on the entire show, so the ringmaster was also the clown and the trapeze artist and the horse and camel trainer. Sounds like the life of a sysadmin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evening we made pizza together, and Christopher actually did most of the work. He put the flour and water in the mixer, helped roll out the dough, poured on the tomato sauce, arranged the salami, and spread out the grated cheese. He then washed his hands for 20 minutes, which should have made me suspicious. Sure enough, he had spread sun lotion throughout the guest bathroom, on the walls and the fixtures, as well as in his hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a fun weekend with Christopher, but I'd still rather have Mama around.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The adventure for Christopher and me today was a trip to Hamburg. We parked at Berliner Tor and took the U-Bahn to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.landungsbruecken.de/hamburg.htm&quot;&gt;Landungsbrucken&lt;/a&gt;, the gateway to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hafen-hamburg.de/html-engl/home.htm&quot;&gt;Hamburg Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. There I treated Cristopher to a harbour tour on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisiana-star-hamburg.de/&quot;&gt;Louisiana Star&lt;/a&gt;, and we drank capuccino and hot chocolate as we looked at the big container ships. We then went downtown and took a look at the home electronics store &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saturn.de/&quot;&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;. This was Christopher's first long outing without the buggy, so he walked the entire day and came home exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>German Practice</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/02/21/german-practice</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(My apologies for the German posting, but this joke made the rounds on our office E-Mail this morning, and it's better than most. My attempt at a translation is &lt;a href=&quot;/2003/02/21/2105.php#more&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ein Ratespiel im Flugzeug&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ein Rechtsanwalt sa√ü im Flugzeug einer Blondine gegen√ºber, langweilte sich und fragte, ob sie ein lustiges Spiel mit ihm machen wolle. Aber sie war m√ºde und wollte schlafen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Rechtsanwalt gab nicht auf und erkl√§rte, das Spiel sei nicht nur lustig, sondern auch leicht: &quot;Ich stelle eine Frage und wenn Sie die Antwort nicht wissen, zahlen Sie mir 5 EUR  und umgekehrt.&quot; Die Blonde lehnte ab und stellte den Sitz zum Schlaf zur√ºck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der Rechtsanwalt blieb hartn√§ckig und schlug vor: &quot;O.K., wenn Sie die Antwort nicht wissen, zahlen Sie 5  EUR, aber wenn ich die Antwort nicht wei√ü, zahle ich Ihnen 500 EUR !&quot; Jetzt stimmte die Blonde zu und der Rechtsanwalt stellte die erste Frage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wie gro√ü ist die Entfernung von der Erde zum Mond?&quot; Die Blonde griff in die Tasche und reichte wortlos 5  EUR r√ºber. &quot;Danke&quot; sagte der Rechtsanwalt, &quot;jetzt sind Sie dran.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sie fragte ihn: &quot;Was geht den Berg mit 3 Beinen rauf und kommt mit 4 Beinen runter?&quot; Der Rechtsanwalt war verwirrt, steckte seinen Laptopanschlu√ü ins Bordtelefon, schickte e-mails an seine Mitarbeiter, fragte bei der Staatsbibliothek und bei allen Suchmaschinen im Internet, aber vergebens, keine Antwort. Nach 1 Stunde gab er auf, weckte die Blonde und gab ihr 500 EUR. &quot;Danke&quot; sagte sie und wollte weiter schlafen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der frustrierte Rechtsanwalt aber hakte nach und fragte: &quot;Also gut, was ist die Antwort ?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wortlos griff die Blondine in die Tasche und gab ihm 5  EUR !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A guessing game on an airplane&lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer was sitting next to a blond on an airplane. He was bored, and asked her if she would like to play a fun game. But she was tired and wanted to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer did not give up, and explained that the game was not only fun, but easy. 'I ask a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me 5 Euros. Then you ask me a question for 5 Euros.&quot; The blond refused and reclined her seat to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer was stubborn. 'OK, if you don't know the answer, you pay 5 Euros, but if  I don't know the answer, I'll pay you 500 Euros!.&quot; This time the blond accepted, and the lawyer asked the first question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is the distance from the earth to the moon.&quot; The blond reached in her purse and without saying a word paid 5 Euros. &quot;Thank you&quot;, said the lawyer, &quot;now it's your turn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked: &quot;What goes up the mountain with 3 legs and comes down with 4 legs?&quot; The lawyer was totally confused, plugged his laptop into the Airfone, sent e-mails to his office, sent queries to the Library of Congress and all search engines, but all in vain. After an hour, he gave up, woke the blond, and gave her 500 Euros. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, and wanted to go back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frustrated lawyer was persistent and asked, &quot;OK, what is the answer?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blond reached in her purse and without saying a word paid 5 Euros!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Christopher and I are home alone. Maybe I can slip him off on Oma for a couple of hours on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sloppy editing at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/english&quot;&gt;Deutsche Welle&lt;/a&gt; is turning a domestic &lt;a title=&quot;ABC News: Germany Says Smallpox Report Exaggerated&quot; href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/wire/World/ap20030216_1608.html&quot;&gt;budget and turf dispute&lt;/a&gt; into an &lt;a href=&quot;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/feb0303.html#021803121pm&quot;&gt;international&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2003_02_16_dish_archive.html#90339870&quot;&gt;incident&lt;/a&gt;. The oppostion is asking the health minister why she is stockpiling smallpox vaccine (and outdated vaccine at that) when the interior minister says there is no threat of a smallpox terrorist attack . DW-World &lt;a title=&quot;DW-World: Ministers Play Down Threat of Smallpox Attack&quot; href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1430_A_781802_1_A,00.html&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interviews, two German government ministers let readers know that there is little danger now that that [sic] American-hating terrorists could unleash the smallpox virus on the German population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could imply that a goal of Germany's anti-war policy is to appease terrorists. As &lt;a title=&quot;Amiland&quot; href=&quot;http://amiland.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_amiland_archive.html#89333861&quot;&gt;Amiland&lt;/a&gt; points out, there is nothing in the original interviews that even remotely suggests this. No, this is just domestic politics as usual, nothing to see here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, as &lt;a title=&quot;NY Times Op-Ed: Behind the Great Divide&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/18/opinion/18KRUG.html&quot;&gt;Paul Krugman&lt;/a&gt; says (as cited by &lt;a href=&quot;http://tschwarz.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_tschwarz_archive.html#%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2089343424&quot;&gt;Tobias Schwarz&lt;/a&gt;), maybe the media in Europe and the US are reporting from such completely different perspectives as to make any understanding totally impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher's favorite picture right now is this poster of the steamship &lt;a title=&quot;Ships of the World: An Historical Encyclopedia - - Deutschland&quot; href=&quot;http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/ships/html/sh_026600_deutschland2.htm&quot;&gt;Deutschland&lt;/a&gt;, which we have hanging in our hallway for obvious sentimental reasons. Every evening on his way to bed, he has to sit on the stairs for 2 or 3 minutes and admire the &lt;em&gt;big ship&lt;/em&gt;, with four &lt;em&gt;smokestacks&lt;/em&gt; and an &lt;em&gt;anchor&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hamburg-Amerika Linie is today called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hapag-lloyd.com/&quot;&gt;Hapag-Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;, and they still sail ships. And fly tourist jets (although they recently sold the airline to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tui.com/en&quot;&gt;TUI&lt;/a&gt;). Christopher would approve of both lines of business.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fellow expat &lt;a title=&quot;Adam Curry's Weblog&quot; href=&quot;http://live.curry.com/2003/02/12.html#a3078&quot;&gt;Adam Curry&lt;/a&gt; wonders how he missed the &quot;growing anti-americanism in Europe&quot;. It seems to exist only in the media. I'm not so prominent as Adam, so the media never asked me about it, but I to agree. I have never personally experienced any sort of anti-Americanism at all here in Germany. There's no talk of boycotting trips to the US, or boycotting American products (well, except for Microsoft products :-). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to say whether it's good or bad, but Americans seem to be more &lt;a href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2003/02/Clashofcultures.shtml&quot;&gt;emotional and sentimental&lt;/a&gt; about things, feeling that their friendship has been betrayed. France opposes war with Iraq, and the US media accuses France of being &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nypost.com/seven/02102003/index.shtml&quot;&gt;ungrateful&lt;/a&gt; for D-Day. I'd guess most Europeans don't see the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are calls in the US to boycott French wine and Perrier water. Shouldn't they be boycotting Chrysler and T-Mobile as well?&lt;/p&gt;

Although if I were forced to choose between war and Germany &lt;em&gt;Volksmusik&lt;/em&gt;, I'd almost choose war.&lt;/p&gt;

That's not quite correct... I've submitted a title and a promise to flesh it out. But I do (in my humble opinion) have a good title: &quot;Warblogs for Euro-Weenies -  Searching for the DeutschePundit&quot;. Eight words down, one thousand four hundred ninety-two to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was always able to ace the essay questions in college, it should be no problem for me to 'Contrast and compare the development of politcal weblogs in Germany and the United States, with particular emphasis on the differences in internet usage, journalistic standards and political culture'.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, can anyone point me to any German political blogs that are CDU/CSU-oriented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Weenies. Vienna. Get it? Oh, I am &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; clever. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is there a mole in the Chancellor's office? Only an enemy agent could propose releasing to the press a supposed Franco-German plan to send UN peacekeepers to Iraq while the US Defense Secretary is in Germany, without informing the Americans, or the French, or anyone else in NATO, or the Defense Ministry, or the Foreign Ministry, or even Joschka Fischer, or anyone other than the Chancellor himself. And two days later, everyone denies that such a plan ever exisited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Germany no longer has any enemies. Who would hate Germany, who would hate Gerhard Schr√∂der so much as to launch such an evil plan. The only one that could hate the Chancellor that much would be.... could be... must be... Oskar Lafontaine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless it were... Rudolf Scharping?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm glad the &lt;a title=&quot;Amiland&quot; href=&quot;http://amiland.blogspot.com/2003_02_09_amiland_archive.html#88809910&quot;&gt;Amiland&lt;/a&gt; reads the German papers so I don't have to. He mentions a report from the &lt;a title=&quot;USA stoppen Investitionen in ihre deutschen St√ºtzpunkte&quot; href=&quot;http://www.wams.de/data/2003/02/09/40345.html&quot;&gt;Welt am Sonntag&lt;/a&gt; that the US Dept of Defense has halted investment at US bases in Germany, in particular planned construction at the air bases at Ramstein and Sprangdahlen. A hospital planned for Sprangdahlen will likely be built in Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if relations were currently good between Germany and the US, I wouldn't regard moving bases to the east a bad thing. The new NATO members are closer to potential action and can use the help more than the rich Germans. It might give a new purpose to NATO which currently seems directionless, which right now can't even decide how to come to the aid of Turkey in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I live in the former British Occupation Zone, and therefore my local economy would not be affected one iota by an American pullout.&lt;/p&gt;

We're spending the afternoon baking muffins, since my co-workers will be expecting treats from me tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; It was not really my intent to fish for birthday greetings, but thanks for all the well wishes! In appreciation, here's our muffin recipe (my apologies for the European units).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mama's Banana-almond-chocolate Muffins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
150 g (1-1/2 cups) flour type 405 (all-purpose)&lt;br /&gt;
100 g (1-1/4 cups) slivered almonds&lt;br /&gt;
2 tsp baking powder&lt;br /&gt;
1 pinch salt&lt;br /&gt;
1 package vanilla sugar (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)&lt;br /&gt;
2 eggs&lt;br /&gt;
150 g (2/3 cup) softened butter (or margarine)&lt;br /&gt;
150 g (2/3 cup) sugar&lt;br /&gt;
4 cl (3 tbsp) Amaretto (or 1 vial Amaretto essence)&lt;br /&gt;
1 sliced banana&lt;br /&gt;
60 g (2 oz.) chocolate flakes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preheat oven to 180&amp;deg;C (350&amp;deg;F). Mix the flour, almonds, baking powder and vanilla sugar, and set aside. Beat the eggs, sugar and Ameretto until foamy, and slowly add butter. Mix in the flour mixture, then add the banana and chocolate flakes. Fill muffin forms 2/3 full and bake 20-25 minutes. Makes ca. 1 tray.&lt;/p&gt;

Because subsidizing cows is too important to be left to politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's also right that the US tends to take the EU much too seriously. Let me try to explain... the EU is just like NAFTA, except with a parliament. And a flag. And a hymn. A very &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.italcultusa.org/DCeuhymn.html&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt; hymn, I might add, and composed without any EU subsidy at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Elections in Lower Saxony and Hessen</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/02/02/elections-in-lower-saxony-and-hessen/"/>
   <updated>2003-02-02T19:02:44+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/02/02/elections-in-lower-saxony-and-hessen</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, the local elections in Lower Saxony were a resounding landslide for Gerhard Schr√∂der, his crowning as the Chancellor candidate who would eventually defeat Helmut Kohl. Today, the election was a resounding defeat for his successor and prot√©g√© Sigmar Gabriel, and a victory for Christian Wulff, the quiet CDU leader who twice lost to Schr√∂der. As a resident of Lower Saxony, I can certainly live with a Premier Wulff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDU has, as expected, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dw-world.de/english/0,3367,1430_A_769775_1_A,00.html&quot;&gt;won historic victories&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Landtag&lt;/em&gt; elections Lower Saxony and in Hessen. The Union has over 48% in both states, and may have absolute majorities in one if not both local parliaments. The SPD suffered huge losses, at or near post-war lows. Greens and FDP gained in both states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schr√∂der tried to play the Iraq card (he announced his 'no' in the UN Security Council at a campaign rally in Goslar), but voters didn't buy it. For one, the card has been already played, and for another, voters are smart enough to know that foreign policy is made in Berlin, not in Hannover and Wiesbaden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with &lt;a href=&quot;http://chicagoboyz.blogspot.com/2003_02_01_chicagoboyz_archive.html#88419844&quot;&gt;Ralf Goergens&lt;/a&gt; that this is the beginning of the end for Schr√∂der. The Bundestag elections are too fresh, and the leftists in the SPD have no alternative. I'm afraid the only way to get rid of Schr√∂der is at the polls in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Put It In A Letter</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/31/put-it-in-a-letter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you want to get involved in grassroot politics, you have to start small. You can join the local branch of a political party, organize petition drives, talk to your neighbors, express your views to your congressman or MP, and write letters to the editor. And maybe, just maybe, you can make a small difference. Unless your name is  Aznar, Blair, or Berlusconi, then your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110002994&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; can make a huge difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An issue I almost always raise on my posts on foreign policy is whether Europe matters? The warbloggers say no, but constantly whine about Europe anyway. (Does that make them warwhiners?) Gerhard Schr√∂der said no, and that made it OK for him to use the Iraq crisis for domestic purposes. The French seem to say no, except insofar it can help them reassert their influence in the world and the EU. Donald Rumsfeld's 'old Europe' remarks seemed to imply that he wished Europe would matter more. The Aznar letter is a sound reply that yes, Europe does matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Nephew &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/01/24/2080.php#comments&quot;&gt;commented&lt;/a&gt; on my small mammal post that &quot;[It seems] like the more important repercussions of the Iraq crisis are the transatlantic ones.&quot; I think so, and I think this letter is the first step to clearing things up. The transatlantic partnership is important. Stop. It is too important to abuse for domestic or EU politics. Double stop.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile at work, our CEO announced that she is leaving at the end of the month, i.e. tomorrow. I don't want to say that she was unpopular in our department, but someone hung a 'Ding Dong' sign on our door, citing the &lt;a title=&quot;Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead!&quot; href=&quot;http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/thewizardofoz/dingdongthewitchisdead.htm&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; from the Wizard of Oz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the CTO is taking over for her and we'll have to get by with just two board members for the time being. Just as well, we're cutting costs all over the place and are planning no increase in sales, and are hoping to break even on the year. To put things in perspective, our sales for a year are equal to the sales in Mama's division for two weeks. And most weeks she makes a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher's grandparents will be disappointed to hear that the OshKosh overalls they gave him for Christmas already have a hole worn in the knee. They are the only pants he ever wants to wear, so I guess we will have to find a way to patch them from the inside. He doesn't like patches on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>An Axe for the Toolbox</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/28/an-axe-for-the-toolbox/"/>
   <updated>2003-01-28T17:01:43+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/28/an-axe-for-the-toolbox</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm unlucky enough to have to maintain internal web servers on a few outdated Linux boxes, with various versions of Red Hat, Suse, and Mandrake. Trying to keep Apache and PHP current on them is a nightmare, since current RPM packages are not available for old distributions. (MSSQL admins learned over the weekend how important it is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/56/29027.html&quot;&gt;keep your servers  current&lt;/a&gt;.) And I simply do not like the way Mandrake packages Apache (with separate servers with and without mod_perl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building my own RPMs would be silly, since I only have one of each box, so I would still have to compile 5 different Apaches. I have been using &lt;a title=&quot;ApacheToolbox&quot; href=&quot;http://www.apachetoolbox.com/&quot;&gt;ApacheToolbox&lt;/a&gt; to try to keep things somewhat organized. But compiling a current PHP on an older box with ApacheToolbox is still a nightmare, since 1) it installs PHP as a static module, so updating PHP means updating everything, and 2) PHP gets confused about which libs (system or ApacheToolbox) to link. Given that my boxes are busy with other tasks, trial and error with PHP/Apache compiles takes literally hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I happened upon a solution. Compile ApacheToolbox &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; PHP, then compile PHP as a dynamic module with apxs. ApacheToolbox without PHP compiled and installed cleanly on all boxes, and since PHP only looked for system libraries, it was easy to sort them out. I was able to update all my boxes with various PHP extensions before noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this under FreeBSD is much easier, thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshports.org/&quot;&gt;ports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This week this has culminated my being cited by  &lt;a title=&quot;Instapundit.com&quot; href=&quot;http://www.instapundit.com/archives/006988.php#006988&quot;&gt;InstaPundit&lt;/a&gt; without a link, since lately I don't have anything to link to. Time to fix that. By the way, even though I don't share the sentiment of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scrappleface.com/MT/archives/000608.html&quot;&gt;Axis of Weasels&lt;/a&gt;, I think the phrase is as funny as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first heard that Schr√∂der and Chirac had announced their joint intention not to vote for a war resolution in the UN Security Council, I thought it was extremely stupid. Going public means that private talks aren't working and stating your intention in advance greatly inhibits your ability to influence other votes. I could only think that they wanted to prevent such a resolution from coming to a vote at all, or they wanted to extremely irritate Tony Blair. Surely the United States wouldn't even acknowledge such an announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Rumsfeld blinked. He called Germany and France 'problems' and 'the Old Europe', and his reaction acknowledged that 'the Old Europe' does indeed make a difference. Maybe Chirac and Schr√∂der had outfoxed Bush after all, blindsiding him by announcing their intentions &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the Blix report that Bush has been waiting for. After the Blix report, the US will appear to be proactive by either bowing to the Security Council or by going ahead without them. Either option involves at a minimum a loss of face. That is, if France (and, parenthetically, Germany) really do follow through with their intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess it's only stupid if it doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama got an air cast today (not a gel cast like we thought). It's fastened with Velcro, so she can take it off when it gets uncomfortable. She didn't even have to visit the doctor. She just picked it up from the medical supply store. Meanwhile she's able to put just a slight amount of weight on the injured foot. Several folks have commented that it must be extremely painful. It was, but only the first day. Since then, she has been mostly exhausted from all the hopping and sliding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's missing a monthly meeting tomorrow, but her colleagues have put their entire IT department in motion to set up a webcam connection for her so she can participate. I know how much IT people &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; last minute special assignments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Oma is helping out by picking up Christopher in the afternoon, so I can work a normal work day. When I get home, I get to chase after both Mama and Christopher, so I end up exhausted as well. Otherwise I'd comment on how &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2683409.stm&quot;&gt;Germany and France are joining together push the US out of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. Why else would they announce now that they will not vote for a war resolution?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama went to the doctor today. The ligament in her ankle is not completely torn, so surgery will not be necessary, but the ankle was still too swollen to apply the gel cast today. She'll get that on Wednesday. Meanwhile she is taking Arthotec for the pain and swelling as well as a set of injections against thrombosis. She can slide up and down the stairs, so she's sleeping upstairs again. She go back to work next week, but probably won't be able to drive for another week after that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While hauling leaves out to the woods, Mama stepped into a tractor-tire rut, fell, and tore a ligament in her right ankle. Luckily Christopher was outside, and she sent him to the house to get me. With our neighbors' help, we took her to the local emergency room. There in very uncaring fashion they took x-rays and sent her home with crutches, pain pills, and instructions keep the ankle iced and to visit her doctor on Monday. Our other neighbor is a physical therapist, and she was able to offer massage and some advice in a more caring manner. Remind us to have our next accident &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She will likely be off work at least a week, since she can't drive without her right foot. We'll see how organizing getting Christopher to and from day care will work out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't you know. As soon as the weather gets warm (above freezing) and Mama's off on her first trip of the year, I get the flu. Nothing serious, the usual headache and sore throat that ibuprofin and pinot grigio can handle in the short run, but enough to come home early. My co-workers don't like working with folks who are infectious. Of course, Christopher doesn't issue sick days, but there's always the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005UQZ6&quot;&gt;Kleine Eisb√§r&lt;/a&gt; to keep him occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>To Book or Not To Book</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/13/to-book-or-not-to-book/"/>
   <updated>2003-01-13T20:01:36+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/13/to-book-or-not-to-book</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought the Internet was supposed to make it &lt;a title=&quot;How we did it last year&quot; href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/03/16/1666.php&quot;&gt;easy to book a flight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're set to meet Christopher's grandparents in Florida the first two weeks of April.  We wanted to go in March, but Mama's schedule won't allow it. We'd have liked to spend about &amp;euro;1500 for the three of us to fly, but my queries on &lt;a title=&quot;Expedia: The German Edition&quot; href=&quot;http://www.expedia.de/&quot;&gt;Expedia&lt;/a&gt; came back with 'fat chance'. April is no longer winter season, and it's too close to Easter. There used to be seats on British Airways for &amp;euro;1300 (with a magic transfer from Gatwick to Heathrow... that would be fun with a 3-year-old), but they were long gone. Our only chance was Delta for &amp;euro;1800. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's now getting late, and the fares aren't getting any cheaper. On a lark, I thought I'd try &lt;a title=&quot;What's an Opodo?&quot; href=&quot;http://www.opodo.de/&quot;&gt;Opodo&lt;/a&gt;, the portal set up by Lufthansa and some other European airlines. And there was a special Lufthansa online economy tarrif for &amp;euro;1600 that's not listed on Expedia. Lufthansa is good since that's Mama collects miles there for business. (But not for the service, which, especially on domestic flights, leaves much to be desired. She calls Lufthansa Business Class 'the most expensive &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;de&quot; title=&quot;breakfast rolls&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: dotted 1px; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Br√∂tchen&lt;/span&gt; in the world'.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Opodo website sucks in many ways. It's only usable under Internet Explorer. Under Mozilla the page with the list of available flights is blank. But even under IE it's hard to use. If you hit the back button during a booking, all the data disappears and you have to start over. If you try to login during a booking, all the data disappears and you have to start over. And if you save a itenerary and recall it later, it saves only the search parameters and not the actual flights; in effect all the data disappears and you have to start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was frustrated enough to try to book the flight at &lt;a title=&quot;English spoken by default here&quot; href=&quot;http://www.lufthansa.de&quot;&gt;Lufthansa's&lt;/a&gt; own web site (which, strangely enough for a German carrier, defaults to English). They offer the same special online economy fare, but it is impossible to enter a child as a passenger, or indeed more than 2 adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I wasted 90 minutes of potential Christopher quality time trying to put together a set of flights that I could print out (since I cannot save the flights, only the query) to show to Mama (we need to discuss whether we want quick or leisurely layovers). Then, since my data has disappeared, I'll have to start over to actually book the flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is why travel agents will not go out of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, for the curious, we'll be flying HAM-FRA-IAD-TPA. Maybe we'll be able to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldwideklein.com/comments.php?id=P39_0_1_20&quot;&gt;WorldWideKlein's satellite dish&lt;/a&gt; as we fly over.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Women and IT</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/09/women-and-it/"/>
   <updated>2003-01-09T17:01:36+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/09/women-and-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/000809.htm&quot;&gt;BurningBird&lt;/a&gt; has been relating the frustrations of being a female Unix expert. Way back in August 2001 there was a discussion of Women in IT, for which I wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$703&quot;&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; that never got imported into my new blog. Maybe some parts are now relevant, so I'll repeat the some of it  here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripting News has started a discussion (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/08/25&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/08/26&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) about women in the IT industry, why there are so few of them, and wouldn't it be better if there were more. The responses from women that he's posted seem to agree that he doesn't get it. Maybe it's like the joke about what women really want. If you have to ask, you probably can't provide it anyway. Then again, if you never ask, you'll never find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation in Germany is probably worse, since there are so many factors against working women in general, especially those with children. We've complained about these numerous times here: rare and expensive day care, half-day schools, long maternity leaves, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my company, of our 8 network administrators, 2 are women, which I think is a unusually high percentage. (One is currently on maternity leave; she plans to come back half-time in January.) Of the 40 or so programmers, currently none are women, although we had two women who left the company last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, of those 4 women, only one programmer came to the&lt;br /&gt;
profession via the &lt;i&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;gt;University route. The two admins both took the &lt;i&gt;Realschule&lt;/i&gt;-&amp;gt;Vocational School track, while the other programmer was a career switcher with training  paid for the by the &lt;i&gt;Arbeitsamt&lt;/i&gt; (Unemployment Agency). I would guess that 80% of our programmers and admins come from the University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary education in Germany is traditionally split at the 5th grade into university prep (&lt;i&gt;Gymnasium&lt;/i&gt;) and vocational school prep (&lt;i&gt;Realschule&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hauptschule&lt;/i&gt;). Both our female admins have told stories of how their teachers tried to steer them away from math and technical courses.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Samhain - File Integrity and Intrusion Detection</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/08/samhain-file-integrity-and-intrusion-detection</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At work I've been looking at &lt;a title=&quot;samhain labs&quot; href=&quot;http://la-samhna.de/samhain/&quot;&gt;Samhain&lt;/a&gt;, a file integrity system similar to &lt;a title=&quot;Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html&quot;&gt;AIDE&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripwire.org/&quot;&gt;Tripwire&lt;/a&gt;, but with many additional features, like signing of logs and config files, detection of rogue kernel modules, stealth operation, logging to SQL databases, and encrypted client/server communications. It can probably brew coffee, too, but I haven't found it in the docs yet. The configuration is a bit complicated, but it looks promising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a file integrity system is not to prevent hackers (or rogue employees) from attacking a system, but to be quickly aware of an attack before the attacker has a chance to cover his tracks. It involves keeping cryptographic signatures of important files so that changes can be detected even if the file size and timestamp remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hate editing CSS. I use default stylesheets so I don't have to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after receiving a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2003/01/05/2065.php&quot;&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; from one of the &lt;a title=&quot;Der Schockwellenreiter&quot; href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/&quot;&gt;world's top 5% computer users&lt;/a&gt; that PapaScott was unreadable under Mozilla on his Mac, I sprang immediately into action. He's surfing at a font size of 12, which is quite small, and my stylesheet of relative font sizes was slavishly obeying his preferences and rendering 'small' bodytext in anti-aliased Georgia at 10 pts. Which is apparently &lt;a title=&quot;Jeffrey Zeldman Presents: The Daily Report&quot; href=&quot;http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0602a.html#anti&quot;&gt;bad news&lt;/a&gt; for anyone who wants to actually read such text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don't want to lose any readers, much less those in the top 5%, I've dumped the Georgia font and gone to all Verdana, and fiddled some with the font sizes. The sidebar still isn't quite right, and it's all probably way too big for Internet Explorer, so I'll have to check back on those CSS hacks to create smaller settings for IE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention that I hate editing CSS?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After two years of working at 900 MHz, I finally went out and bought a new computer. Actually, I didn't, I haven't bought a whole new computer in over 10 years. I only bought a new CPU and motherboard, and the requisite DDR RAM. The RAM cost as much as the CPU and motherboard combined, and was the real reason I waited longer than usual before upgrading. I did follow my usual strategy of a getting a low-end AMD processor that doubles my current speed. Well, at least the marketing speed, since the 1800+ runs at 1533 MHz. I can now build world under FreeBSD in 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did think about getting a Mac, especially now that I've got a iMac at work. OSX is nice. Too bad it only runs on overpriced proprietary Apple hardware.  My OS isn't beholden to an evil monopoly, and my hardware shouldn't be either. I'm sure Steve Jobs would brainwash me to want an entire new Mac every couple of years. He wouldn't let me get by with just a CPU and motherboard. And I could could never push a Mac past the Domestic Financial Planning and Review Council.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Five Dollar Bookmarklet</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/02/five-dollar-bookmarklet/"/>
   <updated>2003-01-02T21:01:36+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/02/five-dollar-bookmarklet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About the time my New Year's hangover was starting, Phil Ringnalda had come up with a &lt;a title=&quot;phil ringnalda dot com: Five dollar bookmarklet&quot; href=&quot;http://philringnalda.com/archives/002438.php&quot;&gt;Five dollar bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; in response to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/12/31/2056.php&quot;&gt;authoring app&lt;/a&gt; post. While hacking the MT bookmarklet is a cool idea, and it's handy to know where to do it, it's not really what I had in mind. Of course, I didn't really say what I had in mind. I just made a throwaway cute comment about a two-bit bookmarklet not expecting anyone to take it seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if I were designing the million dollar authoring app, off the top of my head, I would expect it to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;warn me if I were submitting invalid HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suggest tags and attributes that my post may be missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow me to drag and drop links into my post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check if the links are on my blogroll, and allow me to add them if they are not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;check if the links have RSS feeds, and if so allow me to add them to my aggregator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run with the browser and OS of my choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what I was thinking of when I said that a bookmarklet wasn't up to the job. Maybe &lt;a title=&quot;Ranchero Software: NetNewsWire Pro 1.0b4&quot; href=&quot;http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/probeta/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire Pro&lt;/a&gt;, a news aggregator with posting capability, will become something like this, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio Userland&lt;/a&gt; can be scripted to do it, or maybe it will be an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mozilla/&quot;&gt;XUL app for Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe I'm just dreaming. I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Grounded By Stupidity</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2003/01/02/grounded-by-stupidity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was all set to drive in for my first work day of the new year when I noticed that my left front tire was flat. This would have been a nuisance in any case, but was in fact a huge bother because my spare tire was also flat. I had intended to buy new tires next week. Now I was certainly aware that driving without a spare entails a certain amount of risk, but I must admit that I underestimated the risk of leaving my car parked in the driveway without a spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had Mama not had today off, this would have been a real pain to get fixed. However I was able to load the two flat tires into her car and drive off to the tire shop in Buchholz (which was dead as a doornail at 8 am the morning after New Years). I was back home by 9, mounted the new tires up front using only the jack and lug-nut wrench provided by Renault, and could have been at work by 10:30 had I not decided to spontaneously use a vacation day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst thing is that Mama was bugging me all through December to buy tires already, and now I have to listen to her all through January smugly reminding me that she was right.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We spent New Year's at home with Christopher. We prepared a simple raclett (gouda cheese, not the real stuff) and fascinated Christopher with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britannia.org/recipes/showrecipe.php?RecipeID=00000104&quot;&gt;Feuerzangenbowle&lt;/a&gt; (punch laced with flaming rum-soaked sugar). For the first time ever we bought fireworks that were going to show him, but he pooped out about 10 pm, so we had to wait impatiently until midnight to shoot them off without him. Today we moped around the house, reading (Mama a mystery, Christopher his new airplane book, me a tech book on &lt;a href=&quot;http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/&quot;&gt;Cocoon&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's wishing everyone a happy and healthy 2003!&lt;/p&gt;

It was originally a throwaway scene for a variety show, NDR first showed it for New Year's Eve 10 years later. Today they are running it &lt;a title=&quot;Hamburger Abendblatt: Dinner for One&quot; href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/12/31/109069.html&quot;&gt;5 times&lt;/a&gt;: twice in original black and white, twice colorized, and once &lt;em&gt;up platt&lt;/em&gt; (in north German dialect). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do Germans see in a English-language theatre sketch from the 1920s? No one knows. &lt;em&gt;&quot;Maybe it's that our Prussian humor is similar to British humor. But then again, the British don't think it's funny, so maybe it's not British humor after all.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was at first confused by Mark Pilgrim's &lt;a title=&quot;Pushing the envelope [dive into mark]&quot; href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope&quot;&gt;use of the cite tag&lt;/a&gt;, but now that he has &lt;a title=&quot;Million dollar markup [dive into mark]&quot; href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/29.html#million_dollar_markup&quot;&gt;clarified&lt;/a&gt; that he's not doing it &quot;for the children&quot;, but rather &lt;a title=&quot;Tag soup of a new generation [dive into mark]&quot; href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/30.html#the_tag_soup_of_a_new_generation&quot;&gt;just for himself&lt;/a&gt;, I can see the point.

I don't think a two bit bookmarklet is up to the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And is it just me, or does Mark's million dollar markup prevent the Movable Type bookmarklet from working in my &lt;a title=&quot;Mozilla&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/&quot;&gt;two-bit browser&lt;/a&gt;? Why, I'm surprised that anyone links to him at all. :-) &lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Mark points out that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/12/31/2056.php#comments&quot;&gt;just me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Creating an MT Import File from HTML</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/12/23/creating-an-mt-import-file-from-html/"/>
   <updated>2002-12-23T14:12:52+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/12/23/creating-an-mt-import-file-from-html</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.couchblog.de/couchblog/&quot;&gt;Nico&lt;/a&gt; recently trashed his Movable Type database. He had a backup, but it was old (from October), so he was missing about 200 entries. Knowing that I had trashed my database once or twice, he asked me for advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;200 entries is a bit too much to copy and paste, so I came up with a little perl script to create a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtimport.html&quot;&gt;MT import file&lt;/a&gt; from the HTML files of his individual entries. It's customized for Nico's template, but it might be a useful starting point for others stuck in the same situation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nico's template was something like this:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Title&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Post&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
More post&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was able to look for the title between the h3 tags, the body of the post between the title and the 'more' anchor, the extended entry between the more anchor and the closing div tag, and so on. The category wasn't included, so I had to skip it. You'll need to adjust this logic to fit your template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perl is pretty basic. I'm using 'slurp mode' to read in the entire HTML file into a variable, instead of reading the file line by line.  I'm also in the habit of using | to delimit my regex, so they look like m|...| instead of the typical /.../. And when you return a regex in a list context, you get a list of the matches $1, $2, etc. So instead of '$content =~ m|...|;$author=$1;', I can put this one a single line as '($author) =($content =~ m|...|);'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;br /&gt;
# parse.pl - parse HTML files to import into Movable Type&lt;br /&gt;
# usage: parse.pl *html &amp;gt; output.txt&lt;br /&gt;
# Note: you _will_ need to adjust the regex and date conversion&lt;br /&gt;
while (&amp;lt;&amp;gt;) { # for each file on the command line&lt;br /&gt;
# read in entire file to $content, line feeds and all&lt;br /&gt;
# using slurp mode&lt;br /&gt;
    { local $/; $content = &amp;lt;&amp;gt;;}&lt;br /&gt;
# locate the fields we need using regex&lt;br /&gt;
# some matches may include newlines&lt;br /&gt;
    ($author) =($content =~ m|&amp;lt;div class=&quot;posted&quot;&amp;gt;s+(.+?)s+/|s);&lt;br /&gt;
    ($title) = ($content =~ m|&amp;lt;h3 class=&quot;title&quot;&amp;gt;(.+)&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;|);&lt;br /&gt;
    ($text) =  ($content =~ m|&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;s+(.+)s+&amp;lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&amp;gt;|s);&lt;br /&gt;
    ($more) =  ($content =~ m|&amp;lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&amp;gt;s+(.+)s+&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;|s);&lt;br /&gt;
    ($date) =  ($content =~ m|title=&quot;updated: (.+)&quot; name=&quot;updated&quot;|);&lt;br /&gt;
# convert the date to MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss&lt;br /&gt;
    $date =~ s|([-d])02|${1}2002|;&lt;br /&gt;
    $date =~ tr|-,|/|d;&lt;br /&gt;
# printout the fields in the proper format&lt;br /&gt;
    print &quot;AUTHOR: $authorn&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;
    print &quot;TITLE: $titlen&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;
    print &quot;DATE: $date:00n&quot;;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Goose breast, on special at Minimal, so Mama and I can have a private Christmas dinner on the 26th even if the goose from the 25th is history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salami, as long as I'm at Minimal anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potatoes for baking, for the 24th. We have plenty of regular pototoes, but no big ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sled for Christopher? Probably not, the weather is going to thaw and turn slushy.&lt;/li&gt;

I'm no Asian business expert, but I do pay attention to the news, and can point out a few random facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title=&quot;Ostasiatischer Verein e.V.&quot; href=&quot;http://www.oav.de/index.php3?t=e&quot;&gt;German Asia-Pacific Business Association&lt;/a&gt; is based in Hamburg and is extremely active developing business contacts in China and elsewhere in Asia. It was founded in 1900. Business relations with China are not a new thing in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984 Volkswagen signed a 50% 25-year joint venture with China. It was this year &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canadiandriver.com/news/020415-2.htm&quot;&gt;extended&lt;/a&gt; for an additional 20 years. I believe that the US Big 3 thought that 50% was too little control to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg, Germany's largest port, is a sister city with Shanghai, China's largest port. The mayor visits Shanghai annually, with a large business delegation. 230 Chinese firms are located in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I think German business is successful in China because, at least in regards to China,  Germans put business before politics. I don't think Americans would be able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I sent the following (edited for context) to Steven Den Beste in response to latest posting yesterday on &lt;a href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/12/Oldwineinnewbottles.shtml&quot;&gt;elitist Europeans&lt;/a&gt;, a theory I don't think flies very far in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who thinks that Europe doesn't matter, he sure spends a lot of time grousing about Europe. Maybe the problem is as much an American &lt;em&gt;inferiority&lt;/em&gt; complex as it is a Euopean &lt;em&gt;superiority&lt;/em&gt; complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as EU foreign policy, and there won't be for decades, if ever. The EU does things that are either the lowest common denominator of the member states or that don't matter at all. (I'll let the reader decide which category applies to EU foreign policy.) In the end, as happened once again last week in Copenhagen, the EU does what is decided by the French President and the German Chancellor behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that theories of elitism apply to the bit of Europe I'm most familiar with. Whatever ideas of aristrocracy survived German unification under Bismarck were lost when the Kaiser abdicated, and utterly destroyed in World War II and 10 years of living in rubble. Blood and upbringing do not matter in modern Germany. Only money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German political leaders tend to have rather humble backgrounds. Kohl and Stoiber both came from families of low-level civil servents, Merkel was East German physics professor, Fischer was a rock-throwing radical, and Schr√∂der grew up with a single mother in poverty. They came into power not because of who their parents were, or where they studied, but because they very early became involved in (or founded) political parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do agree with Steven on one point. The Europeans who emigrated to America were fundamentally different than those who stayed. But don't think anyone is going to get very far with elitism as a theory of why Europeans are who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,227619,00.html&quot;&gt;Spiegel Online&lt;/a&gt;, the documentary has already aired in Britain and Italy, so it seems to be old news. So why does ARD deem it worthy of prime time? And why is the US State Dept complaining only now? Or did they protest the previous showings as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to have been able to tell the entire story of harvesting a Christmas tree from our front yard, but alas, our tree stand is too small, so we'll have to wait until Monday to bring the tree inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first moved out of the city, Mama used to always bring a small shovel along on our bike rides to &quot;liberate&quot; baby pine trees from the paths at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mu.niedersachsen.de/Aktuell/naturparke/heide.htm&quot; title=&quot;Naturpark L√ºneburger Heide&quot;&gt;nearby nature reserve&lt;/a&gt;, where they would have been tramped to death by tourists, to be planted in our garden. This tree is the last of those liberated trees. It must be about 8 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Grinding Away</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/12/10/grinding-away</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Work has been a grind, as closing up an office 500 km away is a lot more work than just turning out the lights. Projects have to be transferred, equipment accounted for and transported, security schemes dismantled, accounts cancelled. Not to mentioned that it's emotionally draining. The colleagues in Leipzig are being paid until the end of the month, but as of tomorrow their office will be dismantled so they have no place, nor reason, to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Hamburg, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Work Council&quot;&gt;Betriebsrat&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/em&gt; held a meeting with us that explained their side of recent events. It looks like next year will continue to be 'interesting'. Management tried to organize a Christmas party at the last minute, but cancelled when it was clear that there was little interest. Meanwhile, we have coffee again. It turns out providing coffee outright is cheaper than renting vending machines that dispense coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Question for markup gurus: is defining foreign words, as in &lt;em&gt;&lt;acronym title=&quot;Work Council&quot;&gt;Betriebsrat&lt;/acronym&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, an acceptable use of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;acronym&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Tim says I should do this: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span xml:lang=&quot;de&quot; title=&quot;kindergarten&quot;&amp;gt;Kindergarten&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Let's see how it looks: &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;de&quot; title=&quot;kindergarten&quot; class=&quot;foobar&quot;&gt;Kindergarten&lt;/span&gt;. Hmmm, the tool tip is there, but I'd need to define a style. He's right, that's way too hardcore! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further update&lt;/b&gt; The default style in Mozilla for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;acronym&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;{ border-bottom: dotted 1px; }&lt;/code&gt;. So let's see how &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span xml:lang=&quot;de&quot; title=&quot;kindergarten&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: dotted 1px;  font-style: italic;&quot;&amp;gt;Kindergarten&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; looks: &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;de&quot; title=&quot;kindergarten&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom: dotted 1px;  font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Kindergarten&lt;/span&gt;. Hmmm, that's not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama's under the weather, so Christopher and I hiked up to Hamburg for the afternoon to visit the Christmas markets downtown. I decided that we would take the train rather than drive, and thus give Christopher his first ride in a real live Deutsche Bahn train (as opposed to a mere S- or U-Bahn). I had forgotten that it was not only cold but windy (so it was miserable outside at the market), and that there was a soccer match so that the main station was full of HSV fans (so we missed the train I wanted to take home and had to wait an hour for the next one), and that the return train would be packed to the brim with returning weekend travelers (so we had to stand... ever try to get a 3-year-old to stand still for 25 minutes?). In return, the DB never checked our tickets, which I was planning to buy on board, so the trip was relatively inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got home, Christopher told Mama all about trains for a good half hour. So I guess he enjoyed the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

The war in Iraq or transports of nuclear waste aren't enough to get real fired up about, but the dismantling of a squatter settlement by my favorite Interior Minister Ronald Barnabus Schill has brought rioters into the streets several times the past month. Of course, he's been taunting the rioters in the media, and reportedly had to be restrained by his assistants from showing up personally to inspect the law-enforcement efforts. Now, he has recommended to his fellow interior ministers that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/12/07/101940.html&quot;&gt;Germany obtain the Russian gas&lt;/a&gt; used to end the theater siege in Moscow.    I hope he realizes that it would be useless against outdoor riots.&lt;/p&gt;

We forgot all about it, so we had no boots out for Christopher. We tried to make up for it by opening up one of his presents last evening, a double-decker train station for his wooden set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I mentioned that all of his presents this year will come from E-Bay? Does that make us evil parents? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of note: Christopher used the toilet at home for the first time yesterday! That's no great accomplishment for him, he's been practicing at day care for over a week. It is an milestone for his parents, who finally got him to the bathroom in time. Yes, parents need toilet training, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our youngest cat, Karl-Heinz, died in his sleep this morning. He was 16 years old. He was &lt;em&gt;Mama's&lt;/em&gt; cat, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2001/10/11/1561.html&quot;&gt;Helga&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; cat, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2000/01/17/1201.html&quot;&gt;Mausi&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; cat. I thought he was selfish and manipulative, even for a cat. He was cute and he knew it, and he knew how to use it. He was shy and didn't come out for company, but was the immediate favorite of everyone who met him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came from a troubled home in Minneapolis. His name when we got him was 'Twisted Sister', and my first experience when we tried to take him home was that he bit me, through my hand, so hard that I fainted. When we finally got him home, he hid in our basement for weeks. It took literally years for his personality to become somewhat normal.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the category 'things that are much more difficult than they seem', &lt;a href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/&quot;&gt;USS Clueless&lt;/a&gt; is now listed with a last-updated time in my blogroll. Actually, after I figured out how to extract the latest 'Stardate' from his main page, yesterday Steven started &lt;a href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/11/NowwithRSS.shtml&quot;&gt;posting&lt;/a&gt; an RSS feed. So it's now fairly easy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>5 Hours for a Lampshade</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/11/24/5-hours-for-a-lampshade/"/>
   <updated>2002-11-24T07:11:42+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/11/24/5-hours-for-a-lampshade</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama returned from her excursion to Munich yesterday. Even though she has a more than functional company car, she wanted Christopher and I to pick her up from the airport. Why? Her car was at the office (taxi fare to the airport is cheaper than parking), but she wanted to swing by Ikea to pick up a replacement lampshade. Then we would drive her across town to her car. This didn't seem to me to be an efficient use of time, but I agreed anyway. Afterwards, I figured this little adventure cost me 5 hours of free time, which explains why I'm still tired today. But Christopher enjoyed the trip to the airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; While cleaning the living room, Mama knocked the lamp over and broke the new lampshade, after barely 24 hours. Since the lamp had been shadeless for well over a year, I guess that means we'll get the next new lampshade in Spring 2004.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should just get used to the fact that every time Mama goes on a business trip, some sort of disaster strikes. This time it's a failure of day care coordination. The original failed (our &lt;em&gt;Tagesm√ºtter&lt;/em&gt; is at a conference), the backup failed (she forgot to inform her substitute that we were coming), and the backup of the backup failed (the substitute is leaving on vacation today). And the tape in the vault is missing (Oma is out of town). And there is no Plan D. So I'm burning a vacation day today with Christopher. At least it's Mama's last trip for the fall, and she won't have another big trip until March.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Generic Links</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/11/19/generic-links</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/11/18/1991.html&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to do a couple of days ago, I've converted all the internal links to a generic /YYYY/MM/DD format. The individual posts have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/11/18/1991.html&quot;&gt;.html&lt;/a&gt; endings for easier reading, but since the file ending is ignored it doesn't affect anything. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/11/18/1991.swf&quot;&gt;http://www.papascott.de/2002/11/18/1991.swf&lt;/a&gt; will work as well, or even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/11/18/1991.doc&quot;&gt;http://www.papascott.de/2002/11/18/1991.doc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b2 was fairly cooperative with all of this. In index.php, the individual link is now &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&amp;lt;?php the_time('/Y/m/d/');the_id(); ?&amp;gt;.html&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. b2archives.php had to be adjusted to output the new monthly archive links. The *_popup_link functions output relative links that are now wrong in the archive pages. I had to adjust them to add a slash at the beginning of the href. Just for fun, I made the date headline into a link to a daily archive. That function is now really ugly: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php the_date('/Y/m/d/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;d.m.y','&amp;lt;a href=&quot;',&quot;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RewriteRules are the as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/11/18/1991.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, except that each [R,L] has been replaced with an [L], i.e. the link is not redirected to the rewritten link. And of course, the old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/index.php?p=1991&amp;amp;more=1&amp;amp;c=1&quot;&gt;index.php?p=blah&amp;amp;more=1&amp;amp;c=1&lt;/a&gt; links still work as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Then Mama explains he means the actual meaning of the noun, as in a flap, latch or valve. He means the switch on the Lego tracks. I need to turn it so the train can pass. I guess a switch can be a latch laying on its side. Sorry Christopher, I didn't mean to assume that you were being inpolite.&lt;/p&gt;

How stupid does the Union think the voters are? This just goes to show that the Union has no constructive ideas of its own. Of course politicians are liars! All Angela Merkel has to do is ask her old boss Helmut Kohl about reunification and 'blooming landscapes' and 'noone will be worse off'. Then again, Kohl has a history of stonewalling Bundestag special committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update 05.12.02&lt;/b&gt; Greeting to readers from suburban Tennessee! Yes, the Union is still going ahead with its special committee, and Finance Minister Eichel has promised to give as good as he gets (as in, how did Stoiber intend to pay for his &amp;eruo;70 billion of campaign promises). So let the mud slinging begin again, although I would rather have an opposition that would, uh, propose some constructive alternative policy?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher is very picky about his clothes. He always has been, but lately it has been extreme. He has to have an undershirt, a white, sleeveless undershirt. He has to have overalls, with pockets, they are his 'railroad pants'. And he has to have his kite socks, of which we only have one pair. We have to trick Christopher to be able to wash them, or wait until he is asleep. That's why the first thing Mama said when I woke up this morning was &quot;I can't find the kite socks.&quot; They were on the radiator in the bathroom. I had put them there to dry.&lt;/p&gt;

Lately Schr√∂der has been acting like a politician from the previous century, so maybe the picture fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Spiegel, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vowe.net/archives/002701.html&quot;&gt;vowe&lt;/a&gt; points to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,druck-223258,00.html&quot;&gt;commentary &lt;/a&gt; there entitled 'Green Sense, Red Nonsense', that contends that the Greens are the only party making economic sense these days, while the SPD is only concerned with not irritating its lobby groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those keeping score, the latest 'Sunday Question' poll puts the SPD at 30%, CDU 48%, Greens 10%, FDP under 5%. Of course, the problem with the Sunday Question is that everyone knows there really isn't an election this Sunday. Only every four years.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/2002/11/14&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20021114&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.couchblog.de/nico/archives/000870.php#000870&quot;&gt;missed&lt;/a&gt; me at the usual address. That's nice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For German .de domains there is no evil Network Solutions/Verisign monopoly. There is a  central registrar &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.denic.de/&quot;&gt;DENIC&lt;/a&gt;, but as an end-user you deal with your provider or hoster. I moved papascott.de to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cornerhost.com&quot;&gt;hoster&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and they are obviously not a DENIC member, so I had to find a domain-only provider. I've used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrw.net/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; in the past, without any problems, but I thought I'd try &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.united-domains.de/&quot;&gt;someone new&lt;/a&gt; that was a bit less expensive and with online domain administration and a free basic DNS (only one A record, but that's all I need). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently they recycled my paperwork, and after having set up my domain on Saturday, they set it up again on Wednesday, erasing my previous settings (and my A record). papascott.de then resolved to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://62.146.28.82/&quot;&gt;redirect server&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to correct the A record immediately when I saw the error, but their DNS has a TTL of 24 hours, meaning that everyone who had received the bad address wouldn't get the correct address for 24 hours. In the meantime I set up a series of redirects that send the bad address to the temporary domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this would have been catastrophic if I would actually post anything of value here. As it was, the damage was minimal. And I could have avoided all this by using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.easydns.com/&quot;&gt;real DNS hoster&lt;/a&gt;, even though they cost extra.&lt;/p&gt;

That's what's cool* about democracy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*The German text, 'das ist ja das Geile an der Demokratie', is just slightly vulgar. 'Horny' would be a better translation for &lt;a href=&quot;http://dict.leo.org/?search=geil&quot;&gt;'geil'&lt;/a&gt;, but 'horny for democracy' makes no sense in English, even if we do speak of 'lust for power'.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yo, still here. Christopher is home sick, and while Oma has been able to stay with him it still throws a stick into the spokes of our schedule. Plus this is the week of reckoning at work, as the dreaded 6-weeks-before-the-end-of-the-quarter deadline for terminating employment contracts looms. An all company meeting is set for Friday. The rumors are flying, since everyone knows we haven't landed any new contracts, and I remain cautiously pessimistic. Mama's employer isn't doing that well either, but since it is a Dow Jones company everyone hears about their problems. So she's busy cutting costs too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Mama was pictured last week in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bild.de&quot;&gt;Bild Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;. No, not as a Bild Girl, but together with her boss as a promo for her employer. And only in the Hannover edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;('English week' is a German sports term. English soccer teams usually play twice a week, while German teams usually play just once, on the weekend. When a German team does have a midweek match, they call it an English week.)&lt;/p&gt;

Actually, according to Spiegel Online, he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,221621,00.html&quot; title=&quot;Spiegel Online: Schr√∂der will Bush gratulieren - trotz allem&quot;&gt;has&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Here's a quick English summary of the Spiegel article: &lt;b&gt;Schr√∂der wants to congratulate Bush, in spite of everything.&lt;/b&gt; Schr√∂der's press secretary announced that Schr√∂der wanted to congratulate Bush as soon as the final results are in. He didn't want to speculate whether Bush would belatedly congratulate Schr√∂der on his victory in September. &quot;Of course the Chancellor will congratulate the President in the appropriate way.&quot; The Foreign Office explained that the Republican victory would have no effect on relations with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

My job was to listen to police radio and wake up a photographer if anything interesting happened. (Note that I was not to wake up a reporter. Words can be written after the fact.) Anyway, one boring night I was looking through the desk drawer, and discovered hundreds of xeroxed address labels, all with the same address. Walter Mondale's law firm in Washington. I have no idea what the news room was regularly sending to Walter Mondale... it certainly wasn't his newspaper subscription. I imagine there was some deep dark link between the paper and the politician. I have a vivid imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this morning when I woke up, I was somewhat surprised to find her alarm turned off and that she was already up. And dressed. And gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing I noticed she was gone, since often during the week we don't see each other in the morning. Otherwise I would have driven off, and Christopher would have played trains all day long alone at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out she had an early meeting this morning, but could come home early this afternoon. She was so happy that she could cover for me in the afternoon that she forgot to say that I had to take her shift in the morning. I was a bit angry at first, but since I'm the flexible one, and not the breadwinner one, I grudgingly woke Christopher, brought him to his &lt;em&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/em&gt;, got stuck in traffic on the way to the city, and got to work 2 hours later than I had planned.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gentoo Linux</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2002/10/10/intro_gentoo.html&quot;&gt;Gentoo Linux Reloaded&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to give &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gentoo.org&quot;&gt;Gentoo Linux&lt;/a&gt; a try, despite the &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/06.html&quot;&gt;bad experiences&lt;/a&gt; of some that I have read about. The portage system, baed on FreeBSD ports, sounds good, and this could finally be a maintainable source-based Linux system. Even if you have an install CD, there's still a lot to download, since the sources are not on the CD (I cheated and did a test install at work, then burned a CD with the distfiles). But even though you no longer have to compile your own compiler when installing, you still have to compile your own kernel. And they don't let you copy the kernel from the install CD. I guess that would be cheating. I haven't compiled a Linux kernel from scratch in many moons, we'll see how many tries it takes to get something that boots. My test install at work didn't boot, but it was under VMWare so maybe it was doomed to fail anyway. &lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; In the time it took to write this post, the kernel finished compiling and worked on the first try. However, grub took two tries to work correctly. But now my Gentoo is happily updating itself.&lt;/p&gt;

They were expecting 100,000 to come see the new Elbtunnel. It turned out to be 500,000, and it was absolute chaos as the shuttle buses and ferries were unable to keep up, And even today, with the new tube open for traffic, there was still 18 km backed up for morning rush hour, since there are still only 2 lanes free in each direction. And the impatient try their luck with the Elbe Bridge, which was then backed up for 12 km. That's where I was stuck, which I only mention because after crawling in traffic for over an hour this morning, I mistimed a red light downtown. In the intersection saw the flash of the cameras on both sides of my car after it turned red. I can only hope that I was within the 2 second tolerance, or that the cameras were out of film. Or both.&lt;/p&gt;

The number of dead hostages seems to have stabilized at 117, but then it's still early in Moscow. When this started amd I was dreading the outcome, I was afraid that over a hundred hostages would die. In that sense my fears were realized. But this is still a good outcome. The Russians were right to do something rather than to do nothing. Those 'black widows' came to Moscow to die, but they never dreamed that they would die in their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are saying that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapundit.com/archives/005044.php#005044&quot;&gt;Putin was right&lt;/a&gt;. As far as I know, Putin wasn't even consulted the morning of the raid. That might be because the decision to take action had already been taken the night before. But all I know is what I see in the news.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The 6-lane autobahn tunnel under the Elbe River in Hamburg was opened in 1975. It was designed for a maximum daily traffic volume of 75,000 cars. The current traffic on an average weekday is 120,000 cars. So you can imagine that most drivers are trilled that the 4th tube with 2 additional lanes will be opened to traffic on Monday. But first, on Sunday, the 4th tube will be opened to foot traffic as a huge &lt;em&gt;Volksfest&lt;/em&gt;, complete with food stands and music. Organizers expect 100,000 visitors. There's no place for them to park, of course. They will have to drive to the AOL Arena and take shuttle buses to the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I can think of better things to do on a Sunday than to walk through a tunnel with 100,000 fellow citizens, even if is raining cats and dogs like it did today. And I don't expect the traffic situation to clear up right away. Now that the 4th tube is done, the reminaing 3 tubes will be closed for renovation, one at a time, so that all 4 tubes will not be open simultaneously until Fall 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

That's probably the best result one could have hoped for, given that previous hostage takings by Chechen terrorists and rescue efforts by Russian special forces had resulted in death tolls in the hundreds. &lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; ZDF now speaks of 90 hostages killed, over 350 in hospital, and called the chemical used by the special forces 'nerve gas'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of links back to me on this subject. Hey, all I did was watch and listen to the news. I'm no expert on Russia. I've never been to Russia and speak no Russian. I also seem to have been a bit misunderstood. I did not &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailbox.univie.ac.at/~prillih3/blog/2002/10/26.html#a587&quot;&gt;wonder why noone had blogged&lt;/a&gt; the subject.

The situation seems just as desparate as I feared yesterday. Last night German TV (well, at least ZDF) was again full of long special reports on the crisis, while the sniper in the US was mentioned 'only' as a report during the normal newscast. But then Moscow is closer than Washington, and there's no ocean in between. And the US has seemed to have solved the sniper problem, while in Moscow there is no solution in sight. Or perhaps even possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Russian special forces have apparently taken control of the theatre, killing the leader of the terrorists: &lt;a href=&quot;http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;amp;ncid=716&amp;amp;e=1&amp;amp;u=/ap/20021026/ap_on_re_eu/russia_theater_raid&quot;&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=worldnews&amp;amp;StoryID=1636744&quot;&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.

This is Bali times 3 in slow motion, and none of the terrorism or Russia experts I saw had any hope of a peaceful solution. None.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's not very reassuring to work for a German financial software company when magazines like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1397028&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt; (pay only) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/inhalt/0,1518,grossbild-215880-,00.html&quot;&gt;Der Spiegel (cover story)&lt;/a&gt; (cover free, story pay only), and even the local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/10/12/80263.html&quot;&gt;Hamburger Abendblatt&lt;/a&gt; carry stories on the 'German Banking Crisis', and how the first reaction of the banks is to cut back on IT spending. The Economist article is especially good, since it points out how special treatment for &lt;em&gt;Sparkassen&lt;/em&gt; (savings banks) skews the whole domestic banking sector. Most of our customers are &lt;em&gt;Sparkassen&lt;/em&gt; (or their IT &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dvg.de/&quot;&gt;outsourcers&lt;/a&gt;), with the notable exception of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postbank.de/&quot;&gt;Postbank&lt;/a&gt;, yet another special case in the banking market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the preliminary results are in, and it looks like that 90% of my co-workers did indeed agree to the pay and vacation reduction for this quarter. I guess many, like me, waited until the last minute. So management got what they wanted, we'll see what happens. I'm cautiously pessimistc. And yesterday we brewed the last of the company-provided coffee. We have to organize our own from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

The police have now started issuing similar threats to sites mirroring the poster, and Der Schockwellenreiter has called on bloggers everywhere to mirror the poster to render the censorship efforts absurd. Now, I find the poster in questionable taste, as well as the whole 'tradition' of May Day rioting, but I should be able to view the poster myself and make my own decision.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Electoral Shift</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/10/20/electoral-shift</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usefulwork.com/shark/archives/000266.html#000266&quot;&gt;Stefan Sharkansky&lt;/a&gt; responded to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson101102.asp&quot;&gt;Victor Davis Hanson's&lt;/a&gt; post-mortum on the German election with the following: &quot;The election was close, but it was a regional victory. Schroeder won in the former Communist East. The more pro-American Stoiber won among America's allies of more than 5 decades in the West....&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't overestimate the influence of the eastern states, with just 18% of the electorate. Yes, the 5 eastern states overwhelmingly supported the SPD (39.2% to 29.0%) while the west favored the Union (40.6% to 37.9%). However, the Union won just 3 of 11 western states. Stoiber's majority in the west came from his landslide in Bavaria (42.2% to 33.1%). If Bavaria is excluded, the SPD handily won the 'rest of the west' (40.8% to 36.4%). The north-south divide is just as pronounced as east-west. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the Federal Republic, the Union could count on a 'B√ºrgerliche Mehrheit', a center-right majority (the SPD governments of Brandt and Schmidt were exceptions when the FDP jumped ship). Now the center-right has lost two elections in a row. The self-destruction of the PDS can only further help the SPD. At today's SPD party congress to approve the new coalition, Chancellor Schr√∂der declared that 'now, once and for all, this is no longer a CDU country'. Unless the Union can find a new long-term strategy, it will stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(My figures are back-of-an-envelope calculations from the state by state 2nd vote results available from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/&quot;&gt;Bundeswahlleiter&lt;/a&gt;, link seen at &lt;a href=&quot;http://toaster.michael-timm.de/&quot;&gt;Toaster XP&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The New Old Blogroll</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm now including the update times in my blogroll like I used to. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogrolling.com/&quot;&gt;Blogrolling&lt;/a&gt; makes my data available as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpc.blogrolling.com/rss.php?r=ff5c543c6d32b2efee7f40bbb537da2d&quot;&gt;chronologically sorted RSS file&lt;/a&gt;, which I can parse quite easily using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Magpie RSS Parser&lt;/a&gt; for PHP (thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; for the tip). Magpie chokes if any entities are in the file, but since I set the titles myself, I can easily avoid that. I do need to do a bit a parsing to convert the 'Last updated' string to a time/date I can use. One advantage over the data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blo.gs/&quot;&gt;blo.gs&lt;/a&gt; is that I can include sites that do not ping weblogs.com when they update. They land at the bottom of the list. Eventually I'll figure how to check them for updates as well (RSS feed? HTTP headers? md5 sums?).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm not a TCP/IP expert, but I got to feel like one today. Our Notes admin Stefan was wondering why the virus checker in Leipzig wasn't able to download updates from the web over the Squid proxy, even though it was set up exactly like the one in Hamburg.  The proxy even has the same internal IP, but it couldn't be found. And the proxy logs didn't even show an attempt to connect. So it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tcpdump.org/&quot;&gt;tcpdump&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ethereal.com/&quot;&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue. They confirmed that Notes never did try to connect to the proxy, but was trying to do a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address. The DNS in Leipzig must be broken, the lookup fails. When Stefan entered the hostname of the proxy instead of the IP address, the download worked. Even though the instructions say to enter an IP address. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama's in Munich for 'media training' until tomorrow night, and Christopher is at his substitute &lt;em&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/em&gt; Petra, since Heidi is at a conference. Petra usually doesn't work afternoons, but keeps Christopher until 5 pm as a favor to us. So I make an extra effort to pick him up on time. Except this afternoon on the &lt;em&gt;Autobahn&lt;/em&gt;, I hear a strange clunking from the back of my car just after the &lt;em&gt;Elbtunnel&lt;/em&gt;. Pull off into an industrial area, and sure enough, the right rear tire has blown. No sweat, pull out the spare tire, get the car up on the jack, and pull off the bad wheel. It won't budge. It's stuck as if it were welded on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to start getting creative. Call the auto club. Call Mama, who has Petra's number. Call Petra. Wait. Call Mama's sister-in-law to pick Christopher up... not home. Call Oma... she's home, and can pick him up. Call Petra to say Oma will pick up Christopher, and will even bring him to our house. A hour has gone by. Call auto club again, I'm next in line. Wait. There's the auto club car, but doesn't come to me He stops across the street! A guy there apparently called first. Wait half an hour for the auto club man to fix his Audi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 7 pm, 2 hours after my first call, the auto club car finally crosses the street to me. My wheel is rusted tight, says the auto club man. He pulls out a hammer and a piece of wood, and after about a dozen hits the wheel finally starts to budge. Change tire, fill out auto club form, call Mama to say everything is alright, call Oma to say I'm on my way, and arrive home 2-3/4 hours late. Christopher was nearly asleep, but wakes up when he hears me, takes an hour to settle down, and falls asleep on the couch instead of in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wouldn't have been at all possible to manage without a cell phone. There wasn't a pay phone anywhere near where I stopped. And in case you're wondering why my posts are few and far between and why I'm still using the b2 default layout... stop wondering.&lt;/p&gt;

I remember 1987 in Minnesota, when the Twins somewhat unexpectedly stumbled into the World Series. We had followed them somewhat religiously that year, attending some 20 games (we would bike to the Metrodome and usually sit in the $3 bleacher seats). Once the team made the playoffs, we looked at our bank account and said, no, we couldn't afford any playoff tickets. Or World Series tickets. And we stuck to our decision. We watched Game 7 at a neighborhood sports bar full of Cardinal fans (our South Minneapolis neighborhood had a lot of black 'immigrants' from St. Louis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but that World Series marked a turning point for the two of us. For me, it was the beginning of the end of my graduate studies; 6 months later I had dropped out of graduate school. For Mama, her boss announced that fall that he was moving to Arizona, the beginning of a series of job changes which ended 3 years later in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally got Christopher to the photographer yesterday for his passport pictures. Since the US passport takes a different format than German ID, we couldn't use the instant passport picutres, but instead had to pay for a portrait. Christopher was in no mood to be photographed, so he looks very skeptical. Back at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usembassy.de&quot;&gt;US Embassy&lt;/a&gt; website, I found more information on &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/specialreq.html&quot;&gt;issuing passports to minors&lt;/a&gt; as well as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/DS-3053.pdf&quot;&gt;official form in PDF&lt;/a&gt; for Mama to give her consent, and also found out that foreign-issued passports are now produced in the US, explaining the increased cost and the long wait (2 to 3 weeks). That's probably good. My consulate-produced passport from 1994 is green, is not machine-readable, and looks like something I pasted together in my basement. It gets strange looks at every border I cross.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher is starting to become frightened of monsters. For example, I had thought that &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.imdb.com/Title?0198781&quot;&gt;Monsters, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; would be a cute video for us to watch together, but after the first two minutes, he demanded that I turn it off. Since then, the couple of toys he has from that movie have been at the bottom the the toy favorite list (as in he throws them down the stairs everytime he notices them). And yesterday's &lt;em&gt;Sesamstrasse&lt;/em&gt; had a theme of scary shadows that look like monsters, and the theme did not please him at all. He was impressed by on clip where the monster in Ernie's bedroom turned out to be a quilt. That became his mantra for the next hour. &quot;Monster. Quilt. Monster. Quilt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of monsters by today's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lileks.com/bleats/archive/02/1002/100202.html#101102&quot;&gt;Bleat&lt;/a&gt;, which also provides an accurate description of what happens to a father's psyche when the mother is out of town for several days.&lt;/p&gt;

Not that I have any real use for an office package, but sometimes you can't avoid having to use one. At work we are going to be cutting way back on the number of MS Office licenses (I think down to 20; we have 130 employees). The rest of us will have OpenOffice.&lt;/p&gt;

She hasn't lost her job yet, but Simone of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluepixel.chimerahost.de/&quot;&gt;bluepixel&lt;/a&gt; (site now blank) has been given a &lt;em&gt;Abmanhung&lt;/em&gt; (cease and desist order, legal step before being fired) by her employer for allegedly revealing company secrets on her blog. Examples of reactions are from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogworld.de/entry.php?id=00242&quot;&gt;Bloghaus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sunflyer.ch/site.php?sid=5045332856fa6539a601edc9f55947f0&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;Sunflyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pepilog.de/eintrag-00464.htm&quot;&gt;Pepilog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.couchblog.de/nico/archives/000647.php&quot;&gt;Nico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/10/09.html#a8334&quot;&gt;Der Schockwellenreiter&lt;/a&gt;. All I can add is that a weblog is not a private place. It's public. You have to write as if your employer is reading every word, as well as your wife, your lover, your parents, your children, your enemies, and the whole world. Then again, if your boss is going to be such a jerk, you're probably better off without that boss. &lt;/p&gt;

So I'm giving them a try. I'm importing their HTML directly for now, rather than groking RSS, but it still doesn't look bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You'll never have heard of Kathy Byrne Caruso, unless you've ever played the game of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avalonhill.com/default.asp?x=games_diplomacy&quot;&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/a&gt;. In the Diplomacy hobby, she was a legend. She could lie, cheat and stab in the back with the best of them, and in Diplomacy, those are compliments. (Diplomacy is like a stylized form of the game of Risk, but only if you could say that chess is a stylized form of tic-tac-toe.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was also my friend, back in the 1980s when I was involved in the play-by-mail Diplomacy hobby. That was (and is) a community much like the weblog community, except the technology then was mimeograph, typewriters, photocopies, pen and ink, envelopes, stamps, and sometimes the telephone. Someimes we'd even travel cross-country to meet one another and play for a weekend. I was an awful player, but I enjoyed the company, and enjoyed producing a chatty zine, which I called 'Irksome'. That's how I met Kathy and her husband John, then living in Queens, New York. A brash-talking New Yorker, I'm not sure how she hit it off with a shy Minnesota boy, but we got along fine. She even got to know Mama, who was still in Germany, by mail, and on Mama's first visit to the States we went to New York to stay with John and Kathy for a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I hadn't heard from her in over 10 years, I'm sure that if we had ever met up again, within 5 minutes we'd be caught up. However, last month, I found out (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://devel.diplom.org/Postal/Zines/TAP/&quot;&gt;The Abyssinian Prince&lt;/a&gt;) that Kathy had just died after a quick but severe bout with lung cancer. I nearly mentioned her here then, and was thinking of her when I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/index.php?p=1876&amp;amp;more=1&amp;amp;c=1&quot;&gt;Young, Dumb and Excited&lt;/a&gt;, the saga of our wedding day, since Mama's first stop in the States on her way to marry me was to stay overnight with John and Kathy. This past weekend, I heard from John, and I was able to gather some thoughts about Kathy for him. Mama thought that I had expressed myself well, so as my tribute to Kathy, I'll include my thoughts here, hoping that they will make some sense to those who never knew her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I hope all this public reminiscing is helping to soften the blow of losing Kathy, a woman who was very, very special. I remember you two most not for anything that happened in the hobby, but how you helped us when Mama came from Germany to the States, when both she and I were both young and silly enough to decide to live in the same country and get married. Yes, Mama slept with you two before she slept with me, at least on that trip. We've never forgotten that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the bobby, I remember the Maniacal game, GMed by Bob Osuch, where we were going for a 17-17 draw and she stabbed me on the last turn to take the win. In the end I wasn't surprised to be stabbed, and not at all bitter. I can't remember the other players anymore. John Michalski? Dick Martin? I never was a good Diplomacy player, but finishing second to Kathy made me look, and feel, good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And, yes, there was a wild ride in a rental car from the KC airport to Wichita for Pudge Con with Kathy and Al Pearson. I don't remember any details, just that the entire ride was hilarious. We kept wishing we weren't in Kansas anymore, but we were always still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And Mama and Kathy did invent the Beer River variant (pour a beer on the Diplomacy board, forming a river from Moscow through Munich to Paris that fleets can follow). Did that variant ever get registered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As you might imagine, Mama wears the (financial) pants in the family. She's a regional manager for (her employer in) Germany, in charge of 210 locations in northern Germany, and the first woman to advance as high in the company. She has a big, fat BMW 530 as a company car, and that helps make up for the travel and the long hours. I work as a webmaster for a e-banking software company in Hamburg. And we do have a little Hanson. Christopher will turn 3 in December. What little free time we have revolves around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My only tie to the Diplomacy hobby these days is TAP, which I get via email, and which I try to at least skim each issue. I keep a personal weblog at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/&quot;&gt;http://www.papascott.de/&lt;/a&gt;, where I sometimes put Christopher pictures, but mostly ramble. It's like a zine where I don't have to bother GMing any games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thanks for getting in touch, John. I feel lucky to have known both you and Kathy, and  I've missed out by not getting in touch with you guys since leaving the hobby. We could have had a great time with Kathy when she was in Germany last year. Our loss.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we spent the day in Eckernf√∂rde, visiting with Mama's cousin Rudi visiting from New Zealand. He had left Germany as a boy in the 1950's, and after decades renewed contact with his German relatives, so that we are now seeing him for the 3rd time in 4 years. Mama has a convention in Sydney on her calendar for 2004, so she might get a chance to return the favor. Rudi was regretting missing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyleague/story/0,10069,805946,00.html&quot;&gt;National Rugby League final&lt;/a&gt; (and will be disappointed that New Zealand lost). But I know how he feels, seeing as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startribune.com/stories/503/3348777.html&quot;&gt;Twins won their playoff series&lt;/a&gt; while I was asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Indian Thaw</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/10/04/indian-thaw/"/>
   <updated>2002-10-04T05:10:09+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/10/04/indian-thaw</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I didn't think it important enough to mention, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapundit.com/archives/004417.php#004417/&quot;&gt;InstaPundit.Com&lt;/a&gt; noted that President Bush sent German President Rau a message of congratulations on the anniversary of reunification and that is a sign of a thaw in German-American relations. I don't buy that. It's a reminder that George Sr. was one of the godfathers of German reuinification, but says nothing about the current situation. Would a birthday card to the Queen of England mean everything is hugs and kisses with Tony Blair?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that Schr√∂der has been completely silent on Iraq since the election. I noted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/index.php?p=1884&amp;amp;more=1&amp;amp;c=1&quot;&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; that Schr√∂der left himself an out on Iraq, and I'm certain that when the war comes, there will be some token German show of support, like maybe leaving the anti-chemical-warfare tanks now stationed in Kuwait (which wouldn't require Bundestag approval).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other notes: Schr√∂der's coalition margin is thin, but not fragile. German governments have run on less. Adenauer once had a stable majority of one. &lt;em&gt;Mehrheit ist mehrheit!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, there are budget problems, but they are hardly new. They are complicated, since the deficits are mostly at the state and local levels, which all count in the 3% deficit limit set by the Euro. Real work on the budget would require Schr√∂der to cooperate with the states in the Bundesrat, where the Union has majority and is led by (you guessed it) Bavarian Premier Stoiber.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been been smoothing out the transition from MT to b2, cleaning up the database, making the permalinks individual entries rather than anchors in an archive, replacing the MT archives with redirects to b2, adding a referer check, putting a notice in the old RSS feed that the feed has now moved, and such things. I do need to bring in the blogroll yet and massage the nav column a lot! Or maybe 2 nav columns? And I need to apply Mark Pilgrim's &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintoaccessibility.org/&quot;&gt;accessibility tips&lt;/a&gt; (which I never did in MT, since I knew the next default templates would include them, which is why I stuck with the default MT template).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>YB2?</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/10/02/yb2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why did I switch blogging systems? It's directly related to the shaky situation at work. If I'm going to be looking for work in a few weeks, I need to focus on my strengths, which are PHP and MySQL. And it only makes sense to run my weblog with those same technologies. Nothing against Movable Type. It's a very good, well thought out system. But right now I need something simple that I can extend, to hone my skills, and maybe shore up my resum√©.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What caused the penny to drop for me was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000716.html&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; by Jonathon Delacour that he didn't want to become a PHP programmer, his focus was on writing. Since I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; program PHP for a living, and would like to continue to do so, I had better start living, thinking and &lt;em&gt;dreaming&lt;/em&gt; in PHP. Even if I don't end up leaving my employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learned that simple database structures can be a lifesaver. Movable Type uses 17 tables, and many of the fields are obsolete. pMachine, which I nearly switched to, uses 25 tables. b2 (or Cafepress, I'm not sure why there are two names) has just 5: posts, categories, comments, users, and settings. In moving my posts and comments from MT, it was fairly easy to find which columns to copy over, keeping in mind which functions in MT are not supported in b2. I had to run the text through the nl2br function in PHP, that was the only real complication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B2 does not implement a template system. The template index.php is in PHP, and you get real grease you get on your fingers when you touch it. I like that. I'm looking forward to getting my fingers dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Our Visit To The Consulate</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/10/02/our-visit-to-the-consulate/"/>
   <updated>2002-10-02T16:10:58+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/10/02/our-visit-to-the-consulate</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was the big day. I had the day off alone with Christopher (both the &lt;i&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/i&gt; and her backup are on vacation this week, so Mama, Oma and I are juggling shifts), I had all the papers, so we were off to the US Consulate, the 'Little White House' on the shore of the &lt;i&gt;Aussen Alster&lt;/i&gt; lake in Hamburg, to apply for Christopher's citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security was immense. The street and sidewalk in front of the building are closed for an entire city block, with no less than 4 police containers and at least 8 German officers armed with automatic weapons. They checked my passport before entering the street, and escorted  us to the gate, weapon in hand. There we were handed over to the Americans. My passport was checked again, my cell phone was taken away, and we were sent through the metal detector. We could then enter the passport office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn't planned to apply for the passport today, since I thought the 'Report of Birth Abroad' had to be processed first, so I had no pictures ready. But I was advised to apply anyway, since I needed to take an oral oath (raise my right hand, the whole bit) in front of a State Dept officer for both applications, and could thus save a trip by applying for both today. We also need Mama's written consent (I guess to prevent child-napping), but we can submit that along with the pictures by mail. Good thing I stopped at the bank. Cost: $65 for the Report of Birth, $30 for the passport with a $40 surcharge for a child, for a grand total of $135 (Euros accepted at 1:1). And please include a A4 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.genealogy.com/00000820.html&quot;&gt;SASE&lt;/a&gt; with the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher was more impressed by the sailboats on the &lt;i&gt;Alster&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't expect management to give a concrete response, but in this case, even no response is a very understandable response, whether what we are being asked to give up is just a drop in the bucket or a drop on a red-hot stone.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Politics are going domestic again, so that means things are returning to normal. The newly elected parties are raising trial baloons over which taxes to raise, after promsing before the election not to raise any taxes. And the Union led Bundesrat refused to approve the Red/Green anti-corruption law, apparently because they are pro-corruption?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My employer is not doing as badly as MobilCom, which has been abandoned by sugar-daddy France Telecom and today announced it will have to cut 50% of its ca. 5000 work force. After all, this is now third time my employer has been on the brink, and we haven't fallen over yet. But maybe I'll go part-time for the 3 months instead of taking the pay cut. A few hours of extra Christopher time per week are worth far more than any stock options, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

We seem to have taken another turn for the worse. Only this time we have a &lt;em&gt;Betriebsrat&lt;/em&gt; (worker's council), so instead of being told by management what's going to happen, we are being offered a choice. Either we can reduce our pay by 2-10% (sliding scale based on salary) for the next 3 months (and only the next 3 months) and give up 3-5 vacation days for this year (and only this year), and be compensated with stock options (ha!) for the financial loss, or else another round of lay-offs is inevitable. I rather doubt that enough of us our willing to sign off on the reductions, and thus my mood about work and life in general is not all that good this evening. Hmmph.&lt;/p&gt;

Not to punish Germany, because it wouldn't be much of a punishment, and would cost the US most than it would hurt the Germans. It &lt;a href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/09/EUforceprojection.shtml&quot;&gt;wouldn't force the Germans to increase defence spending&lt;/a&gt;, and not would hurt the German economy in any noticable way (some communities in SW Germany would hurt, but they all voted for Stoiber anyway, so it's no skin off Schr√∂der's nose). But it'd be a sure sign that the world has changed, and that the Americans don't need to protect anyone from the Germans anymore. OK... time to play alarm clock!&lt;/p&gt;

The thing is, he doesn't realize he's sick, so I had to keep reminding him that he has to keep his socks on, he can't go outside, and maybe he should take a nap (he didn't). Today he is sleeping in. He's well enough to go to the Tagesmutter, once he wakes up, but now it's already past 9, I wouldn't make it to the office until 10:30, and would have to leave right at 4.  My boss has offered to be flexible at such times, and today I think I'll take him up on it. At worst I'd take a vacation day from next year. So, gotta go, I hear stirring in Christopher's room....&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Did We Get Into This Mess?</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/24/how-did-we-get-into-this-mess/"/>
   <updated>2002-09-24T02:09:25+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/24/how-did-we-get-into-this-mess</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I described how I would vote in the German election if I could, I deliberately left out the topic of Schr√∂der's anti-American campaign. All politics are local, and I would have chosen my party based on domestic issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm no great fan of George W. Bush, and my own opinion on Iraq is ambivalent. I can't think of a good reason to use force against Iraq, but then again, I can't think of a good reason not to, either. The attack on Iraq is inevitable, and I believe that it would be best for Germany to play little or no role in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am very distressed by the rhetoric Schr√∂der chose to use, and the resulting deterioration in US-German relations. He could have expressed an anti-war platform without attacking the US leadership. But he chose to make it personal, and in so doing created an atmosphere that made stupid, outrageous, unthinkable comments like those by D√§ubler-Gmelin possible and thinkable (she was a third-rank minister quoted out of context, but that's not the point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schr√∂der was calculating that since Bush seems to have already made up his mind to attack Iraq, Germany would have no influence on the decision and he could go public with his opposition. On the surface, that is true. The American decision on Iraq wouldn't have been influenced one iota by German opposition or support. But at a deeper level, human emotions play a role in foreign policy that goes beyond the mere projection of national interest. This is even more true for nations like the United States that are founded on moral ideals, as opposed to 'merely' being based on a common people and culture (like, for example, Germany). This feeling of loyalty and trust is right now shattered, and it goes beyond the feelings of two leaders who haven't gotten along from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schr√∂der didn't want to become anti-American. He just wanted to win an election. He would do best just to stay quiet on foreign policy for a while, let the war on Iraq develop without comment, and let his foreign minister try to pick up the pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a view from the States, Steve Den Beste has two articles &lt;a href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/09/GermanAmericanRelations.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2002/09/HowwillAmericanpolicytowa.shtml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; reacting to the election and describing how bad things have gotten.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's the day after, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/&quot;&gt;Spiegel Online&lt;/a&gt; is full of resignations. M√∂llemann resigns from his national FDP party offices (but not as chairman in NRW). D√§ubler-Gmelin announces she won't be available for the new cabinet (as if Schr√∂der was going to ask). And Merz is making way for Merkel to be Bundestag minority leader. The teams might be the same, but you're going to have to buy a new program to tell the players.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Schill Party: 0.6%</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Translated from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.welt.de&quot;&gt;Die Welt&lt;/a&gt;: Hamburg - The Schill Party received ca. 4.4 percent of the vote in Hamburg (nationwide: ca. 0.6 percent). Thus the party failed to achieve its goal of eight percent. Party Founder Ronald Schill does not, however, want to give up his national political ambitions. 'In principle this is a disappointing result,' he admitted, but that it is 'no embarassment to have landed under five percent'.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The final result is not yet final. We'll have to wait for the count of 'overhang representitives', the number of directly elected representives over the proportion of the total vote. They should increase the SPD faction by up to 5 seats, according to ZDF, giving Red/Green the majority, but we won't know for sure until 3 am when all districts have been counted. If you understand the electoral college in the US, then I'm the overhang reps will be completely clear. Good night!.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/22/elephant-round</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two hours after the polls close, the party leaders come traditionally to an &quot;elephant round&quot; discustion broadcast simultaneously on the two main networks ARD and ZDF. Usually the election is decided and the consequences are discussed. Tonight, nothing is decided yet, and the elephants have nothing yet concrete to say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schr√∂der can most likely continue to govern. The PDS is out. The FDP has lost big, thanks to M√∂llemann. The Union and the Greens have made gains. The result could depend on 'overhang representitives' for the two main parties. At this point, it is sure that a government will not depend on the PDS, and that a grand coalition will not be necessary. For that, at least, we can be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How I Would Vote</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/22/how-i-would-vote/"/>
   <updated>2002-09-22T14:09:02+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/22/how-i-would-vote</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is election day in Germany. Most of the pople I've talked to see it as having to pick the least worse of 5 bad choices. As as non-German citizen, I cannot vote, but this is how I would vote, if I could.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schr√∂der's term has been disappointing. The economy is stagnant, reforms have been half-hearted, labor regulations and social insurance costs have reduced the incentive for firms to add workers. Still, the country is better off than 4 years ago, at the end of the do-nothing Kohl administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoiber has pointed out these failings, but has little to offer as an alternative. For me, there are at least 3 strikes against Stoiber and Union. 1) Immigration. The Union's opposition to even meagre reforms can only be described as medival. 2) Family. A party that declares that the 2-earner household cannot be not a model for German families is certainly not interested in helping my family. 3) Fiscal irresponsibility. The argument that 'increased growth' will pay for their spending increases and tax cuts is unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the small parties? The ex-communist PDS lives in a fairy-tale land. If the FDP were truly a small-business small-government party, they might be interesting, but they are really a feed-the-rich party, and the M√∂llemann controversey shows they need to find themselves and put their own house in order before they should have a share of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Greens? If they were truly a small-business small-government environmental party, they might be interesting. But they've turned establishment. They do have a competent figurehead in Joschka Fischer, and they have the right platform for my pet issue, nuclear power (which I think has no place in a free society). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the end, I would vote Green. If you disagree with me, you'll be happy to know that Mama does, too, und, unlike for me, her vote counts.&lt;/p&gt;

We began to suspect that he actually didn't fall the other night, but instead has an ear infection. Mama took him to the emergency room in Buchholz, and sure enough, an ear infection it is. It was tough to notice because he is in such a good mood, and has no fever. The doctor put him on the 10-day antibiotics / paracetomol / mucus dissolver trip. Now we just have to convince him to settle down for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/21/superpowers-have-feelings-too</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapundit.com/archives/003434.php&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that George W. Bush &quot;doesn't give a shit what Europeans think&quot;. From American reaction to the German election campaign and the remarks of Justice Minister D√§ubler-Gmelin comparing Bush and Hitler, that report was obviously false. The United States does care what the world thinks about it, and even a superpower has feelings that can be hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D√§ubler-Gmelin has demonstrated at least 3 degrees of stupidity during this episode (first making the remarks in the first place, in a discussion with labor representitives where she forgot the press was present, second approving the quotes for publication in person at the offices of the  &quot;Schw√§bische Tagblatt&quot;, and third trying to deny at a press conference yesterday that she had meant what she said). However, it was her boss, Gerhard Schr√∂der, who created the atmosphere that made such unthinkable remarks possible. He made Iraq a campaign issue, he accused the US of pushing for a military adventure, and made political attacks on the US fashionable this election season. The minister was wrong, dead wrong, and deserves the political banishment that awaits her, but the chancellor shares much of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've recently been ranting about how I wish I had an RSS reader at my web hoster. Looking again at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/news.html&quot;&gt;AmphetaDesk&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed that there is a hack that makes it much more useful for me: &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cantoni.org/software/amphetadesk.html&quot;&gt;FTPstore&lt;/a&gt; is a slight addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in sync. It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.&quot; So I can keep &lt;a href=&quot;/myChannels.opml&quot;&gt;myChannels.opml&lt;/a&gt; here, and maybe do interesting things to and with it. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Let's scroll down the stories this evening at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/&quot;&gt;Spiegel Online...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/debatte/0,1518,214836,00.html&quot;&gt;Top story&lt;/a&gt;. Edmund Stoiber, answering a question from the audience in a TV interview. saied that as Chancellor he wouldn't allow use of American bases in Germany for a unilateral US attack on Iraq. Either he left his brain in the make-up room, or he's decided to out-Schr√∂der Schr√∂der, who has been careful not even to hint denying German airspace to US forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,214837,00.html&quot;&gt;Further down&lt;/a&gt;. FDP candidate Guido '18' Westerwelle is refusing to make campaign appearances with his vice-chair J√ºrgen 'Paratrooper' M√∂llemann, after M√∂llemann this week mailed out brochures repeating his attacks on Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the Vice President of the German Jewish Council Michel Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,214663,00.html&quot;&gt;yet further down&lt;/a&gt;. Justice Minister Herta D√§ubler-Gmelin is accused of comparing George W. Bush with Adolf Hitler. She was quoted by the newspaper Schw√§bischen Tagblatts: &quot;Bush wants to distract from his domestic political problems. That's a popular tactic. Even Hitler did that.&quot; D√§ubler-Gmelin denies comparing Bush with Hitler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have Germany's politicians all lost their minds? No, only their nerves. There are just 72 hours until the polls close on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

He replied that he's not (inadvertantly), and that weblogs.com may have outlived its usefulness anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase William Joel, 'you may be right'.  I'm finding a number of sites that I'd like to follow don't ping or ping irregularly, and that a number of pings are false alarms. But is maintaining local copies of 50 RSS feeds over dialup really a better alternative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all due respect to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/&quot;&gt;desktop RSS readers&lt;/a&gt;, I have too many desktops for that to be practical. The only thing my desktops have in common is Mozilla. For me it makes more sense to keep the feeds I want to follow at my hosting server. It doesn't bother me to have my feeds publicly accessible. I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; people to know what I read. I don't want an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/&quot;&gt;Amphetadesk&lt;/a&gt;, I want an Amphetaserver!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; has put together an &lt;a href=&quot;http://traumwind.server-wg.de/blog/magpie/index.php?url=http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/rss.php&quot;&gt;RSS reader with PHP&lt;/a&gt;, and that might be the direction I'll go.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One week before election day, Schr√∂der has pulled ahead of Stoiber. As usual, the NY Times gets the analysis mostly right in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/15/international/europe/15GERM.html&quot;&gt;For Now, Trading Allies for Votes&lt;/a&gt;. They forget that Bush and Schr√∂der got off to a rocky start, as the Germans were blind sided a number of times in the opening weeks of the Bush administration.  In fact, Schr√∂der is not taking that much of a foreign policy risk by playing the Iraq card, since Bush doesn't seem to be listening to the Europeans anyway, and wouldn't have asked for German troops in any case. Not being on the Security Council, German support or opposition makes little difference. When the war does come, Schr√∂der has left himself a rhetorical out, albeit a thin one, if Iraq can be linked to terrorism (and it will be). But Germany can forget about a permanent UN Security Council seat for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama called. She's catching the last flight from Munich to Hamburg, and won't be home until close to midnight. She said the airport was much emptier than usual. Christopher tried to distract her  by describing our visit with his granparents to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.serengeti-park.com/&quot;&gt;Serengeti Park&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. 'Monkey bus. Giraffe. Tiger. Lion. Train. Boat. Elephant. Airplane. Pizza.' Wait, pizza is what we had for supper tonight. And 'monkey bus' means the monkeys crawled all over the moving tour bus, reaching in the windows for fruit that the driver had passed around to the passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Online Registration</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/10/online-registration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So after almost 3 years, I resolved to finally get Christopher his US Passport, or at least get him registered at the American Consulate so he can get a SSN and vote and pay taxes and all that fun stuff. I had been putting it off until now at the high cost ($40 for registration + $40 dollars for passport, cash only, and if you don't pay in dollars you get a really bad exchange rate). Going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usembassy.de&quot;&gt;http://www.usembassy.de&lt;/a&gt;, I see 1) they've raised their prices to $65 / &amp;euro; 78 (who does their banking?!?), 2) I have to get a special birth certificate for Christopher, and 3) they want a certified marriage certificate, which we no longer have since we submitted it when registered our marriage here. OK, I have to order some documents. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;http://hamburg.de&quot;&amp;gt;http://hamburg.de lets you order birth certificates online without a credit card (long live COD!), if you can figure out which of the half-dozen offices in Hamburg is responsible for the location of the birth.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us&quot;&gt;http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us&lt;/a&gt; does not offer marriage certificates online, but does offer a fax number for requests (have your credit card number handy!). However, once I get the paperwork together, I cannot complete Christopher's registration online or even by mail. That must be done in person at the consulate. I just love having to go through armed guards to do business with my government.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Young, Dumb and Excited</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/09/young-dumb-and-excited/"/>
   <updated>2002-09-09T03:09:56+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/09/young-dumb-and-excited</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our young heroes had met in high school, ages 16 and 17, both wearing the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afs.org/&quot;&gt;American Field Service&lt;/a&gt; sweatshirt at a church function. He'd just come back from a summer in Brazil, she was from Germany and currently an exchange student in a neighboring town. They became sweethearts, went to prom, graduated, she returned to Germany, they promised to 'stay in touch', he went to college.  Six months later they resolved to remain sweethearts. She still had 3 years to finish her Abitur, her parents had no telephone, Al Gore hadn't yet invented the Internet, so they wrote 3 letters a week. The first summer he visited her, the second summer she visited him, and the third summer she came to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was that she would transfer her Abitur credits to the University of Minnesota, study geography or something, maybe play volleyball, and the two would live together without money as a happy student couple for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, without money. That was the hangup. To enter the country on a student visa, you have to have the financing of your education arranged ahead of time. In Germany, financing an education is a foreign concept (as is having to pay for an education). Parental support was out, as her parents 1) didn't have the money, and 2) weren't supportive of the move. The couple wasn't aware of any 'Study in America to be with your sweetheart' scholarship programs, so the student visa was out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/visa;fiancee.html&quot;&gt;fianc&amp;eacute;e visa&lt;/a&gt; was more in their price range. Thirty-five dollars up front, piles of forms, but no proof of financial status required. He was working part-time at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.co.hennepin.mn.us/lawlibrary/lawlib.htm&quot;&gt;county law library&lt;/a&gt; (I forget whether at this time he was determined to become a lawyer, or whether he had been at the law library long enough to have determined not to become a lawyer). He could find out about the piles of forms. She could go the consulate, prove she was a non-Communist without communicable disease, get her ticket and go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind that in the time they had had a serious relationship, they had been together for just 6 weeks (physically, as together in the same room or continent, as opposed to emotionally or spiritually, as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xrefer.com/entry/630372&quot;&gt;cloud cuckoo land&lt;/a&gt;). Or that, despite being married to a Minnesota resident, she would have to pay non-resident tuition for 3 years. As I said, our heroes were young, dumb and excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she arrived in July, with a backpack on her back and nothing in her pocket. He welcomed her into their new apartment, a small rathole near Loring Park (by the next summer they would move to a larger rathole near the College of Art and Design and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackforestinnmpls.com/&quot;&gt;Black Forest Inn&lt;/a&gt;). She looked for work, but the job market didn't have a whole lot of positions available for fresh Abitur graduates with a native knowledge of German. Except in the fast-food industry, which she entered in mid-August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there was the matter of that fianc&amp;eacute;e visa, and the small stipulation that &quot;the marriage must take place within 90 days of admission into the United States&quot;. This was not a step they were particularly looking forward to. But take it they must. From work, he knew of a particularly sympathetic female judge, and made an appointment with her clerk for the morning of the day after Labor Day. He figured the government center would not be very busy then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on the morning of September 6th, 1983, the apprehensive couple headed off on the bus to downtown Minneapolis. At the government center, they were met by four witnesses and guests, one of whom had brought a blender. She figured they needed at least one trapping of a traditional wedding. They took the elevator to the 19th floor, and Judge Sedgwick put it all to rest. There are very few photos still in existence that document this event. Later, they noticed that they had never paid the judge the 25 dollars for her efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving their guests and witnesses behind, their next step was breakfast at her new employer. Her boss was somewhat befuddled that her new employee would come in for breakfast on her wedding day, and gave them breakfast for free. The boss is still friends with the couple to this day. She had a somewhat more opulent wedding last year, far better documented with pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then boarded a bus for the long journey to St. Paul, home of the regional office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the St. Paul Post Office. There they filed the paperwork proving that they had complied with the stipulations of the fianc√©e visa (the clerk noticed that the ink was still wet on the license) and to apply for her permanent residency (an adventure in which she would be sent four Green Cards with typographical errors before finally receiving a card with everything spelled correctly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was an Irish pub for lunch. He had a lot of mail to prepare. He was involved in the hobby of Play-By-Mail Diplomacy, and published a fanzine with various games and articles. His readers had been following the fate of the apprehensive couple very closely, and he wanted to provide them with a special issue of the zine postmarked with the wedding date and the location of the consumation of the wedding at the INS. So with a pint of Guinness they stuffed envelopes and licked stamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here the details are more fuzzy. It is a fact that the evening was spent at Foxy's, a lesbian nightclub where a friend was DJ on Tuesday nights. Since neither of the two particularly enjoys to dance, they probably had way too much beer and caught one of the last buses back to Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, they had to transfer and wait 20 minutes at Uptown. The woozy couple laughed and thought it would be funny if she ended up dropping her studies and running the fast-food location directly behind the bus stop. Little did they know at the time that is exactly what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We heard the phrase 'young, dumb and excited' used by Minnesota Viking punter Greg Coleman to describe rookie quarterback Jim McMahon of the Chicago Bears. The phrase has stuck in our memories.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the excitement yesterday, I forgot to mention that it was our 19th wedding anniversary. Mama and I remembered to each other, and in light of recent blogger weddings I was planning on writing a long recount of September 6, 1983. But now that I've missed it, I think I'll wait until next year. But an Irish pub and a lesbian disco both played a role in the festivities. As did the INS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Thanks for the well wishes, folks! And I did write up an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/09/09/1876.php#001876&quot;&gt;account of our wedding day&lt;/a&gt; after all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've recently started reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt; again, and there are so many good points in it I should really link to the whole thing every week. This week's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1313840&quot;&gt;Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt; (Fear of America, and of being left out: Why Europe will probably give in over Iraq) is a case in point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eminent Americans visiting Europe recently often seem to find themselves in a state of bewilderment, almost as if they had stumbled into some sort of parallel universe. ?We in America think of September 11th as an event that changed the world,? says Bill Kristol, editor of the neo-conservative Weekly Standard, ?but the Europeans seem to regard it as an event that changed America.? Robert Kagan, author of a much-applauded article on the gulf between Europe and America, comments that ?American policymakers find it hard to believe, but leading officials in Europe worry more about how the US might mishandle the problem of Iraq?by undertaking unilateral or extra-legal military action?than they worry about Iraq itself.?&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/05/anniversary-of-terror</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is both the 25th anniversary of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists/baader/12.htm&quot;&gt;Schleyer Kidnapping by the Red Army Faction&lt;/a&gt; (which culminated in the storming of a hijacked Lufthansa jet in Somalia, the suicide pact of the RAF leadership in prison, and the murder of Schleyer) as well as the 30th anniversary of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hfienberg.com/kesher/2002_09_01_kesher_archive.html#85415470&quot;&gt;Massacre of Israeli Athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.  I've noticed several &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/09/05/65713.html&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; to the former in the German media today. I've seen absolutely no references to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usefulwork.com/shark/archives/000167.html#000167&quot;&gt;Shark Blog&lt;/a&gt; points to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/aktuell/sz/getArticleSZ.php?artikel=artikel7368.php&quot;&gt;article on the Olympic Massacre&lt;/a&gt; in the S√ºddeutsche last week. And I remember seeing a German documentary about it, so it's not as if Germans have repressed the event from their collective memory. It perhaps is not given the weight it deserves. The first time Mama and I were in Munich, we went to the Olympic Village hoping to find a memorial to the slain Israeli athletes. We found a plaque in front of House 31, but nothing else. It seemed totally inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes spam can be funny. A few weeks ago, I got a Klez-infected spam  forged from  'der  at shockwellenreiter.de'. I thought that was funny so I told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/&quot;&gt;Der Schockwellenreiter&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, my Spam Bouncer caught a Klez-infected bounced mail. Someone had forged &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; address in a spam to 'der  at shockwellenreiter.de', and J√∂rg either manually or automatically bounced it ('X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.482)'), but it bounced to me and not to the Klez-infected spammer (in Russia? 'Received: from mx5.mail.ru (mx5.mail.ru [194.67.57.15])...). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick was that there is no trick. Even though the Linux router is not a an access point, it's not in demo adhoc mode, but rather in IBSS mode.

   <title>Where Am I Coming From</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/01/where-am-i-coming-from/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm dense, so it wasn't until Karl &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paradox1x.org/archives/000238.shtml#000238&quot;&gt;mentioned it a second time&lt;/a&gt; that I realized that that &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/000496.php&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; were blogging stories &lt;a href=&quot;http://oblivio.com/road/02082801.shtml&quot;&gt;in five words or less&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe my story is that of just having turned 40 and realizing that life is now going downhill instead of uphill. Or that of having a son who learns faster than I can but still learns from me. Or realizing that I had to leave my parents to realize how much like them I am. Or that I had to leave my country to realize how much a citizen of my country I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is in constant motion, and we do not have the perspective to pinpoint where we are right now. We can only look back at where we have been and calculate our present position by interpolation. And maybe we can guess where we will be tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way, I cannot understand others by simply knowing where they are now. I also must know where they have been. They have been places where I've never been, and I can learn from them, even if I don't understand that right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very important to know where am I coming from. I've deliberately left off the question mark.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>IndyMedia isn't?</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alwin  made a couple of comments on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indymedia.org/&quot;&gt;IndyMedia&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from giving an unconventional definition of 'independent' &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2002/08/26#MTU6NDM6MjAdb&quot;&gt;(&quot;Independent means not taking sides. Doesn't it?&quot;)&lt;/a&gt;, he later comments &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2002/08/29#MDc6Mzk6MjMdb&quot;&gt;if it just seperated the editorial from the content, it would be more credible to me&lt;/a&gt;. (See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paradox1x.org/archives/000228.shtml#000228&quot;&gt;Karl's comments.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally find IndyMedia to be unprofessional and to often play somewhat fast and loose with the facts. But I  think there is &lt;i&gt;no such thing&lt;/i&gt; as news content devoid of editorial. All news has a point of view, whether it comes from AOL Time Warner or The Weekly Reader. The very fact that news  reporters and publishers are a part of society means that they have a personal stake in the news they present. Their point of view cannot be cloaked, and is expressed even in the words they use and what they choose &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reporter without a point of view has nothing to report.  News without a point of view would be utterly boring, and would not worth reading. Or buying. News without a point of view would be worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

My favorite Interior Senator is at it again. Judge Merciless Ronald Barnabas Schill gave his first speech Bundestag speech today, during a debate on the financing the emergency flood relief. He ranted for 15 minutes on how immigration policy was to blame for the proposed tax cut, went over his allotted time, and had his microphone turned off after he said the Bundestag was 'kicking the constitution' for limiting his speaking time. Even Hamburg First Mayor von Beust has distanced himself from his coaltion partner and Second Mayor. I stick by my theory. He's sabotaging his own party's Bundestag campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We missed (er, deliberately skipped) the first-ever German TV debate between chancellor candidates Sunday evening. It sounds like we didn't miss much. The consensus from the media, my co-workers, and the German weblogs I've scanned was the that the format was forced and sterile, Schr√∂der was more convincing,  Stoiber came across better than expected, and the whole thing was rather boring. And they will do it all over again in a couple of weeks. Here are a few English headlines snitched from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsisfree.com/&quot;&gt;News Is Free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Herald Tribune: Europe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iht.com/articles/68843.htm&quot;&gt;NEWS ANALYSIS Stoiber wins some respect in first TV debate with Schroeder&lt;/a&gt; &quot;&lt;em&gt;Edmund Stoiber may not have won Germany's first televised debate between chancellor candidates, but he performed so much better than the meager expectations of the German political world that he emerged into the election's homestretch with both momentum and a new measure of respect.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg World News &lt;a href=&quot;http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?ptitle=Top%20World%20News&amp;amp;s1=blk&amp;amp;tp=ad_topright_topworld&amp;amp;T=markets_box.ht&amp;amp;s2=ad_right1_windex&amp;amp;bt=ad_position1_windex&amp;amp;box=ad_box_all&amp;amp;tag=worldnews&amp;amp;middle=ad_frame2_windex&amp;amp;s=APWnnlha0R2VybWFu&quot;&gt;Germany's Opposition Leader Stoiber Wins Support After Debating Schroeder&lt;/a&gt; &quot;&lt;em&gt;German chancellor candidate Edmund Stoiber won more support from voters than Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in the country's first televised campaign debate a month before elections, opinion polls showed.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFXPress: Europe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afxpress.com/afxpress2/afx/story_43817.xml.html&quot;&gt;GERMAN VOTE Schroeder emerges as more competent than Stoiber in 1st TV debate&lt;/a&gt; &quot;&lt;em&gt;BERLIN (AFX) - German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder came away as more competent than his main rival Edmund Stoiber in Germany's first-ever live television debate last night, nearly four weeks ahead of a tightly contested election, snap opinion surveys said.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio Free Europe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rferl.org/nca/features/2002/08/26082002135714.asp&quot;&gt;Germany: Schroeder, Stoiber Discuss Iraq, Economy In First-Ever Election Debate&lt;/a&gt; &quot;&lt;em&gt;German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his challenger in next month's election, Edmund Stoiber, clashed in a U.S.-style television debate last night, the first-ever held in a German election. The two candidates sparred over German support for any U.S. attack against Iraq, as well as their different approaches to the problems of German unemployment and the sagging economy. Opinion polls were inconclusive on who won the debate, but commentators minimized its impact on changing voters' minds.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1291344&quot;&gt;Economist.com | The continent awash&lt;/a&gt; is a good summary of the flood situation and its aftermath (except that it's a &lt;i&gt;Jahrtausendflut&lt;/i&gt;, not a &lt;i&gt;Jahrhundertflut&lt;/i&gt;). Whether he deserves it or not, 4 weeks before the election Schr√∂der is getting a boost in the polls as a result of the flood crisis, pulling the SPD nearly even with the CDU/CSU after trailing by 5 points a month ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally the flood has crested, but is sinking very slowly, soaking and weakening the dykes. In Amt Neuhaus and Dannenberg, east of L√ºneburg, Bundeswehr troops and volunteers are still shoring up the dykes with sandbags. In Dresden, over 100 of Mama's fellow employees have been severely affected, losing all their household belongings. Her employer is organizing donations.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Between all the flood pictures on TV and watching ships at Cuxhaven last weekend and L√ºbeck on Wednesday, Christopher's latest craze is boats. Mama and I are taking a couple of days off together, and today we took Christopher on a harbor tour. Lots of boats there. Tomorrow we'll hit the beach at L√ºbeck again. Papa wasn't along last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were both somewhat consternated by the disappearance of our digital camera a couple of weeks ago, just before my parents arrived. We were at the point of accusing one another of losing it, or leaving it at the playground. This evening it showed up.  Christopher found it in his Lego box. Now we know who is really to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama promised her nephew that I'd put together a PC for him (nice of her to make promises for me), so I'm scrounging around for old parts. I had a 20 GB hard disk laying around, but seeing as Mama still had just 6 GB, I decided to let her have the 20. She really needs a Windows reinstall, but I was too lazy. I just Partition-Magic'd everything over. PM was even smart enough to make the new disk bootable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dangerousmeta.com/&quot;&gt;Garret&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/&quot;&gt;J√∂rg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;update&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/&quot;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; too, of course) are not the last bloggers on dial-up. We're still connecting via ISDN too. Now Mama is dialing in to her employer quite a bit, and we often have both ISDN lines blocked, often enough that her boss has suggested we get another ISDN line. I thought maybe the Telekom might want to sell us ISDN+DSL, but they didn't seem too anxious for our business (we'd have to &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; cancel our present line, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; they could check if DSL is available for us). So we'll stick with our alternative provider EWE Tel. They're working on DSL, and might get it out here eventually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blo.gs&quot;&gt;blo.gs&lt;/a&gt; was down for a few hours, so my blog roll has a hole in it for today. It's back up now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Elbe flood seems to be weakening just a bit as it approaches Hamburg. The crest appears to have passed Magdeburg without any parts of the city going under water. Tonight the TV reports are from D√∂nitz and Hitzacker, on what used to be the inner-German border. The crest seems to be 50 cm lower than expected, as water has been diverted into polders upstream. The problem up north will be not so much the Elbe itself, as the Elbe dykes seem to be holding, but rather the flood backing up into its tributaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama has a cousin in a flooded village in Meck-Pomm. One of her department heads still has a house in Magdeburg, which is not flooded. Another lives in Geesthacht, of which parts (including one of Mama's restaurants) will be flooded by Saturday. In our county, the dyke should hold.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The flood waters from Dresden are heading north. Flooding is expected in the outskirts upstream of Hamburg by Thursday or Friday. However, Hamburg itself will be barely affected, since the harbor is large enough to disapate the flood. Our county (Landkreis Harburg) has declared an emergency for the Elbmarsch, where 12000 residents may have to be evacuated. The PapaScott residence is 50 km away from the area that might be flooded, so we are in no danger.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of recreating the MT tags in PHP (and losing the ability to add custom tags like Brad Choate's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mtmacros.php&quot;&gt;MT Macros plugin&lt;/a&gt;), I should instead be using PHP to prompt MT to rebuild and save a static page on demand when it's missing, kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/?detail=2002-08-01_16-03&quot;&gt;Martin was talking about&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago. Oh well, it was a good exercise anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Dynamic Archive Template for MT: First Draft</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/08/12/a-dynamic-archive-template-for-mt-first-draft/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I've mentioned before, I'd really like to avoid building static archive files in Movable Type. Below is my first attempt to duplicate the Individual Entry Template using php to extract the entry from the MySQL database. It's totally 0.01: uncommented, unoptimized and lacking any error checking. But, at least for me, it outputs a reasonable facsimile of an individual entry. This is very a much a work in progress, but I wanted to post something since I probably won't be able to work on this for the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; This is a real stupid brute-force approach. I simply took the default template and replaced all MT tags with PHP code. A smarter approach might be a parser to translate the MT tags on the fly. Or maybe not. This is a work in progress. But I think I said that already.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;?php if($_SERVER[PHP_SELF]=='/index.php') { ?&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hit the 'more' link to see the code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;?php }?&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
entry.php, version 0.01. Call as &quot;entry.php?id=xxxx&quot; where xxxx is some entry number.&lt;/p&gt;

Right facts, wrong conclusion. The reason service is so bad in restaurants (and shops) in Germany is not the 'demise of the German work ethic'. As far as I know, German service has &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; been good. Restaurants and shops are chronically short staffed, and customers are seen by employees as an annoyance. But this is hardly news.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/08/10/adventures-with-windows-ce</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After being impressed by one of her franchisees, Mama bought a used Casio E-125 Pocket PC on Ebay a couple of weeks ago. She was going to try out my old Palm III, but while she was thinking about it Christopher grabbed it from her desk and threw it down the stairs. End of Palm III, but I digress. She'd really like to sync it with her Lotus Notes client, but I can see already that getting Pocket Outlook and Notes to work together will be an adventure and a half, so I thought we'd start small and try to sync with Outlook, which is supported out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't get around much, I know, but I've never used Outlook. I don't even know what it looks like, at least I didn't until today. But it was included with ActiveSync, so I thought could just install it and sync to it. But, no, our E-Bay seller forgot to include the original CD pocket with the  product key, so I can't install it from there. No problem, we have Office 2000, so I'll just add Outlook to her Office installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Office refuses to do so. I've repartitioned and added a CD burner since installing office, so it's looking for the CD in the wrong place. No way to update the installation. So I thought I'd uninstall and reinstall Office. Uninstall went fine. Reinstall died, not just once, but three times. I'm starting to sweat now. Mama needs Office to work on her PC at all. I finally think to clean out the registry, restart, and install from the burner, a more reliable device than the CD-ROM. Finally success. We have Outlook, and the rest of Office as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ActiveSync refuses to sync with Outlook. OK, I should have installed Outlook first. Uninstall, reinstall ActiveSync. Still refuses. Remove the partnership to the Pocket PC, it now connects as guest, and now I want to reestablish the partnership. But I can't do it. There is no menu point to establish a partnership, a wizard is supposed to start automatically. But I keep connecting as guest. Update to ActiveSync 3.5. Still guest. Delete the guest profile. Still guest. Search desparately in Google, try changing registry settings. Still guest. See a hint to hit the reset button on the Pocket PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does the trick. The wizard pops up to setup a partnership, and the calendar entries get synced to Outlook. Eight hours after I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people say Linux is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

I leave details to the imagination) and a shortage of inspiration. The situation will only become worse in the next couple of weeks, as Christopher's grandparents are coming for an extended visit, and Mama and I are dividing the hosting responsibilities (subtitle for this post: 'Separate Vacations'). I'm not sure whether the effect on the weblog will be noticeable (can a decrease in creativity be noticed when the amount of creativity was quite small to begin with?), but at least I'll be feeling less bad about it. Or at least more justified. Or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

In the German health care system, doctors seem to get the short end of the financial stick. Patients never see the bill, it gets sent directly to the &lt;i&gt;Krankenkasse&lt;/i&gt;, so the risk of getting caught submitting a fake bill is slight. (Unless you are a gynecologist submitting bills for male patients, as in one fraud case I heard about.) One reform proposal is to send patients copies of their bills. They still would pay nothing, but they know how they were treated and can spot irregularities better than the Sickness Funds. And the typical Geman is very good at complaining about irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;

Or so says my great uncle, who says the cousin accompanied the King on one of his visits to Minneapolis, and called him in rural Minnesota to ask him to come visit. My great uncle had to decline, as he no longer drove and could not get to Minneapolis (and didn't think to ask one of his nephews to drive for him). Details are hard to confirm, as my great uncle is now both elderly and very hard of hearing. At any rate, I will not be knocking on the door of Crown Prince Haakon and Princess Mette-Marit, claiming to be a long-lost in-law.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past week, ever since the rain stopped and it got warm, my lungs have felt like a pair of full sponges, and I've had a persistent cough that made my head spin. But no fever. Yesterday I went to the doctor. He said it sounded like asthma, although I have no history of asthma at all. The lung test was negative, but he still sent me home with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pari.de/english/300/310/314/&quot;&gt;PariBoy inhalator&lt;/a&gt; and a box of Emser Salt solution. I'm skeptical. I'm home from work and feeling better today, but I think it's because the rain started again last night.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MT Is Hard</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/08/01/mt-is-hard/"/>
   <updated>2002-08-01T02:08:48+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/08/01/mt-is-hard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alwin mentions his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2002/07/30#ODozNzoyNCBQTQdbdb&quot;&gt;difficulties trying out MT&lt;/a&gt; and that setting up pMachine was a lot easier (it is), Mark Pilgrim mentions &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/30.html#dive_into_vincent_flanders&quot;&gt;Vincent Flanders difficulties trying out MT&lt;/a&gt;, and Paul &lt;a href=&quot;http://gammatron.novarese.net/2002/07/30.html#a2031989&quot;&gt;concludes that therefore MT must be crap&lt;/a&gt; (as well as Debian GNU/Linux, for good measure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is related to my current problems with Movable Type as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
MT &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; hard to set up. There are a lot of settings that have to be just right before it will run. That's the nature of a CGI. It is a complete program that runs by itself (inheriting a number of environment variables from the web server), and needs to be explicitly given certain bits of information (like where to read and write files). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MT also demands a lot a resources, because 1) that's the nature of a CGI, being called as a separate program by the web server, and 2) the design decision to write static HTML files for all archives. When the archive templates are changed, all archive files need to be rewritten. For PapaScott that's a couple thousand files. My hoster restricts how much CPU time a CGI can take, so MT times out before it can write out all its files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CGI is a clunky, old fashioned way to program web services, slow and resource hungry. Ten years ago there was no other way to do it. These days it belongs in the same dustbin as Netscape 4. However, precisely because CGI is old fashioned, it is available at nearly all web hosters, so that is why I think Ben and Mena chose to develop MT as a CGI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pMachine is easier because a PHP page is not a complete program. It is text parsed by the PHP program, which is usually installed as an Apache module, so it (sort of) becomes part of the web sever itself. pMachine creates entry and archive pages on the fly, so it doesn't need to write any HTML files, saving the associated overhead and setup headaches. All pMachine needs to know is where to find the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul's criticism of the MT documentation is somewhat unfair, since the docs are designed for a user at a commercial hoster with no means or knowledge of setting up the web server. MT does work just fine for me with a standard Apache installation (Linux distributions tend to screw up Apache, so SuSE and Red Hat don't count as standard installations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'll probably stick with MT for now. My hoster has worked out the MySQL issues, so I can use the database again. I do like the user interface and the design, and I don't feel like switching to something completly different right now. I'm writing up PHP versions of the archive templates so I can serve archive pages on the fly. Then I won't have the problems with rebuilding. I have a working entry template already, and I'll post them all when I have them all ready and more-or-less usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for and OS and software that just work, I don't think there is any such thing, except for game consoles. Turn on your PlayStation, plug in the cartridge, and play. It just works. Computers should work the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

The SPD is responding by starting the 'hot phase' of the campaign next Monday, 3 weeks earlier than planned. Meanwhile, someone is releasing politicians' frequent flyer data to the Bild Zeitung. Funny, only politicians left of center are being outed. You don't suppose that it's a plot to help the Union? Nah......&lt;/p&gt;

There's no automatic way to do that, so I bascally reinstalled MT, reset all my preferences, and re-imported all my entries. The date-based archives will not rebuild, niether daily nor monthly, and so all links to them are broken. I'll probably have to end up changing hosters, or blogging software, or maybe both.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/07/24/i-hate-banks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hate banks... no, let me rephrase that. My employer's customers are banks, which means they pay my salary, so I love banks. So much that I set up a web-based bugtracker so they can report problems with our software directly to us. Except that that their sys admins are paranoid, and they test our system in a firewalled network with no internet access. So they can't access our bugtracker. And they still want to track bugs. And the idea of bringng a notebook with a WiFi card, or even a plain old &lt;i&gt;modem&lt;/i&gt; dialed in to T-Online, into their stinking white room hasn't occurred to them. I hate banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, since the customer is always right, I should blame our project manager for not giving me the correct specs, like 'build a web-based bugtracking system than can also be used by users without web access'.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This evening the ARD news magazine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdr.de/fakt&quot;&gt;FAKT&lt;/a&gt; had a segment on working women in Germany.

The career mother has a better job than the father, who has to be be somewhat flexible, but both work full time while the child is cared for by a &lt;i&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/i&gt;.

He calls it 'Bear and Fish', because his favorite scene is when a bear steals a fish from the father and son while camping. He'll even pound on the page with his hands to try to fight the bear off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this weekend that his jabbering now consists of over 50% real German or English words that adults can understand. Maybe he's talking only just as much as he always has, but I can understand more and more of what he is saying, so he's catching my attention more often. And I realize that he is still learning about 10 times as fast as I can, and that he's talking about all the new things he is learning. That's scary, and at the same time exciting. He could probably even solve this problem of installing the current php-xmldom on Mandrake Linux via rpm I've been fighting all weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/07/21/its-raining-men</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I always wondered why rainfall, as a liquid, was measured in inches, a linear unit, and not in unit of volume like pints, gallons, or acre-feet. In Germany, rainfall is measured in liters per square meter, which have satisfied my childhood sense of logic. And can easily be converted to linear units, since a liter is (10 cm)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 1 l/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to 1 mm of rainfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say all this only because it has been raining all week, and it's raining again today. Our part of northern Germany received 150 l/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (6 inches) within a few hours a couple of days ago, Some towns near us (Soltau, Buxtehude, Stade) were flooded, the dike along the Elbe in Drochtersen (where Mama's brother Roland lives) threatened to break, and the highway in Horneburg (near Buxtehude, the route we drive to visit Roland) is still flooded out. along with several homes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt; As Emily Litella would say, &quot;Never mind!&quot; The problem, as I should have suspected, was on my side. My browser font settings were somewhat illogical (default size: 12 px, minimum size: 11px), so of course changing to relative sizes screwed things up. I'll leave my original post as is below as an ode to my confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried out Mark‚Äôs tip for today on &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/15.html#day_26_using_relative_font_sizes&quot;&gt;using  relative font sizes&lt;/a&gt;, but unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work for me, at least not the part about the page looking ‚Äúexactly the same‚Äù as before. For my browser of choice (Mozilla under both Linux and FreeBSD), the posting text was shrunk, but not the sidebar text. Setting a minimum font size fixed the font size, but the leading (line spacing) was still reduced, enough to make it less readable. I‚Äôve left the settings on my &lt;a href=&quot;/validate.php&quot;&gt;validation page&lt;/a&gt;, if you care to look. Maybe noone sees the difference except for me. It could very well be a Unix-only TrueType/XFree86 issue. I had run into similar issues before trying to set up font sizes with CSS, and this serves to remind me why I don‚Äôt do stuff like design and layout anymore. It just makes your brain hurt.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; On Mama's Win98/IE5.5, Mark's CSS makes the leading a tick looser, but hardly noticable, while under Mozilla/Win it's microscopically tighter. Is my obsession with leading because I used to typeset a scientific journal for a living?&lt;/p&gt;

Christopher is now old enough to follow along, so I try to arrange our afternoon schedule so he can watch. The street scenes are made in Hamburg (featuring Samson the bear instead of Big Bird, sometimes with &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.imdb.com/Name?S%E4gebrecht,+Marianne&quot;&gt;Marianne S√§gebrecht&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.imdb.com/Title?0095801&quot;&gt;Bagdad Cafe&lt;/a&gt; fame), and the segments seem to be about 50-50 German/American.&lt;/p&gt;

It's blogging software based on PHP and MySQL, and (as far as I know) is the first blogging package to support TrackBack after Movable Type. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Daniel Fiene's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogstrasse.de/trackback/&quot;&gt;uni.tb &lt;/a&gt; (mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/07/06/1794.php&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; last week) is now available for download as a beta. It's a PHP function can integrate TrackBack into any blogging system than can output PHP. It's been tested with SunLog, pMachine and GreyMatter. At the moment, though, it's only documented in German.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To say the Christopher is obsessed by trains would be a gross understatement. So today while Mama was on the road working (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/07/13/1805.php#001805&quot;&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;), he and I took the S-Bahn to Hamburg and had lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bahnhof-hamburg.de/wandelhalle.html&quot;&gt;Hauptbahnhof&lt;/a&gt; (with a window seat to the platforms below). I was Christopher's hero of the day, or at least for the hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow if the weather is good we'll go to Hamburg's zoo &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hagenbeck.de/&quot;&gt; Tierpark Hagenbeck&lt;/a&gt;. Christopher can name most of the classic zoo animals, so he should have a good time.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; We decided to stay home, due to drizzle and lack of energy. We'll go some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

Well-educated women in their thirties recognize that, although a career sounds glamorous, it requires a tremendous amount of hard work.

i just noticed that the english edition of the frankfurter allgemeine (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faz.com&quot;&gt;http://www.faz.com&lt;/a&gt;) is now updated only weekly instead of daily. too bad. they were often the only english-language source for current german news, and i'll miss them now that the election is heating up. i guess from now on i'll have to write my own news.&lt;br /&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In between all the soccer matches, bicycle races, plane crashes, and corporate crashes, there's an election campaign going on here in Germany. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faz.net/IN/INtemplates/faznet/default.asp?tpl=event/content.asp&amp;amp;doc={8D7210F2-C0EB-48EE-9FDF-3CECAA80B276}&amp;amp;rub={B14F8BC8-7A2B-47C8-ABC9-226E5D69CB15}&quot;&gt;Forsa poll&lt;/a&gt; released today shows that niether Black-Yellow (Union 39%/FDP 8%) under Stoiber nor Red-Green (SPD 36%/Greens 7%) under Schr√∂der would have a majority.  The ex-communist PDS (6%) holds the balance of power. The PDS would tolerate a Red-Green government, but it remains to be seen whether Schr√∂der would tolerate being tolerated. The trend for the Union/FDP is falling, as this is their lowest rating in 8 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal level on who Germans would prefer as Chancellor, Schr√∂der leads Stoiber by a wide margin (49% to 36% in the last poll I saw). Not that it matters... German election ballots list parties and not Chancellor candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that Schr√∂der is slicker than Slick Willy when it comes to campaigning, and that Stoiber, used to safe majorities in Bavaria, is a babe in the woods when it comes to a real election and has no idea what's going to hit him. But I'm rooting for Stoiber to lose, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>30 Ways To Leave Your Lover</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone's already pointing to the excellent series &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/30_days_to_a_more_accessible_weblog&quot;&gt;30 days to a more accessible weblog&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org&quot;&gt;dive into mark&lt;/a&gt;. The examples &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a bit contrived. For &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/11.html#day_2_michael&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, I myself am color blind, and I do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; see the world in shades of grey. Total color blindness, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.achromat.org&quot;&gt;Achromatopsia&lt;/a&gt;, is rare. I just don't see green (an imaginary color that the rest of the world has made up to annoy me). I do, however, recognize all the colors on a traffic light. They are red, yellow, and white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Mark's points are all valid. and yesterday's entry on  &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/07/08.html#day_21_ignoring_spacer_images&quot;&gt;ignoring spacer images&lt;/a&gt; was especially good. And since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org/news/2002_07.shtml#000532&quot;&gt;Movable Type will be adoping Mark's suggestions&lt;/a&gt; in their templates, it won't be any work for me to incorporate them all. I just have to wait 9 more days.&lt;/p&gt;

The notebook would purr lovingly when I put the other card in my FreeBSD workstation, but stubbornly refused to talk to Linux. Since I just want the thing to work, I gave up and put Mandrake 8.2 on the notebook. It's what we use at work, so I can keep updated, and it took just 2 tries to get online. I'm still not completely wireless, since the battery is still shot, but I can get that repaired or replaced. And there's a power outlet on the patio. And the weather is supposed to get better.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama decided we need a new ceiling in the kitchen. That's OK, since we hadn't yet covered the concrete panels that make up our ground floor ceiling with anything more than a coat of paint and a couple of ceiling lamps. And it's mostly her money in the bank account, so she can spend it how she wants. So we're having sheet rock hung 5 cm under the present ceiling, with a few halogen spots built in. It will look nice, I'm sure. And the carpenters say it will take just 3 days, except for the painting. And now, after 2 days, they are 3/4 done, ahead of schedule actually, but the entire kitchen and living room are covered in fine white sheet rock dust. That dust is enough to drive you crazy. And it has. It starts making you wipe or sweep in some corner, muttering like MacBeth's wife, 'Out, out, damned dust', even though you know the dust will be back tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're 'enjoying' the north Germany 'high summer' (cloudy, cold, rainy). (Update: So is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.couchblog.org/nico/archives/000323.php&quot;&gt;Nico&lt;/a&gt;.) Work is busier than ever since we've been minus one for 6 weeks. (My ex-colleague was able to find work already, administering firewalls for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.otto.de&quot;&gt;the world's largest catalog merchant&lt;/a&gt;.) I can't stretch my work day past Christopher's pick-up time at day care, so it's a daily struggle to get things done before having to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A follow-up on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/2002/04/18/1712.php&quot;&gt;Mac question&lt;/a&gt; from a couple months ago. We did end up getting a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/imac/&quot;&gt;TFT iMac&lt;/a&gt; for our QM department. (It arrived within 24 hours, so I guess Apple is indeed having trouble selling them. And why did it come with only OS 9.2 installed?). My question: &lt;b&gt;Are there any web resources for PC/Unix admins adding the first Mac to their network?&lt;/b&gt; I find plenty of infos for &lt;i&gt;users&lt;/i&gt; switching to Macs, but not for PC admins who now have a new beast in their menagerie. (I do know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintoosx.org/&quot;&gt;Dive Into OSX&lt;/a&gt;, but that seems to be for experienced Mac admins.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe public life will get back to normal in the next day or two, now that the World Cup is over with Brazil defeating Germany 2-0. A just result. Germany played their best match so far, controlling midfield, but were unable to penetrate the box and left openings for Brazil at their own end. Yesterday's match for 3rd place (Turkey over South Korea 3-2) was more entertaining, but I guess our boys at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldcupblog.com&quot;&gt;World Cup Blog&lt;/a&gt; were asleep for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

But the real mind bomb, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; would say, is the TrackBack feature, which enables entries in your blog to be pinged by other blogs linking to it, and thus create a list of those links your entry. It will be like an Internet-wide comments feature, once people grok it and other blogging systems implement it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be really nice if MT could ping both weblogs.com and blo.gs by default. But it should be easy enough to add a couple of lines to get that to work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there is news occuring somewhere in the world today, but you'd never know it watching televsion here in Germany. On ZDF, for example, over half the evening news plus an hour-long special report is devoted to Germany reaching the World Cup Final with a 1-0 win over South Korea. No news event (other than 9-11) would receive this much coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

There are days when one of the halves just isn't up to it, and the other half can take over. There are nights when you just can't just wash his face, brush his teeth, and put him in bed. You have to let him wash your face with his wet washcloth (as well as your hair, your ears, your chest, and whatever else he can reach), put toothpaste on his brush 3 times and let him use 3 cups of water to rinse his mouth, and read Winnie The Pooh, The Farm Book, and The Hungry Little Caterpillar before he even thinks of lying down. That's just how it goes. After all, Mom took him to a charity summer party and to watch trains at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof. I guess I can spend a hour with him to wind him down.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just in time in summer patio season, I've manage to break my wireless connectivity. Well, at least my non-Windows wireless connectivity. Since running FreeBSD on my desktop machine has been going so well, I decided to put it on my ThinkPad 390X notebook as well. I wiped out the Debian partitions, not taking note of the wireless settings  it took me &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/06/22&quot;&gt;several days&lt;/a&gt; to work out last summer.  After all, FreeBSD has wireless built in. That was on Thursday. I still haven't worked out how to get the wireless card going. According to ifconfig and wicontrol, everything should be set up properly, but when I ping, the connection lights sputter a couple of times instead of blinking madly as they should. Oh well, with Mozilla and putty under Win98 I can do most of what I need to do, and the sun is too bright to work outside anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>World Cup Germany-USA</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/06/21/world-cup-germany-usa/"/>
   <updated>2002-06-21T04:06:25+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/06/21/world-cup-germany-usa</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bild.de/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Headline from the newspaper Bild: Ami Go Home!&quot; src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/06/bildamirudi-thumb.jpg&quot; width=&quot;125&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today is a day where I can't lose. As an American living in Germany, I'll be happy whichever side wins.  The flip side is that I  know one of my sides is going to lose as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Cup has been very unkind to favorites who expect to win. That will the key for Germany. If they go in looking past the US, they are in trouble.  If their heads are in the right place and are at the top of their game, the US cannot stop them. Their heads have been in the right place up until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the US, they have to come up with something more inspired than the 'stay back and wait for a fast break' that worked against Mexico. Germany has the patience and the physicalness that Mexico lacked, and could make the US look like Saudi Arabia, who tried a similar strategy. The anti-US Korean crowd could also be a factor, not against the Americans (who are used to it by now), but for the Germans (who are usually the bad guys away from home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My prediction for the folks at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldcupblog.org/wcarchives/000252.html&quot;&gt;World Cup Blog&lt;/a&gt;: Kahn gets another shutout. 3-0 for Germany. The US goes home, and will talk about their wonderful win against Mexico for years to come. And if you see any pictures of crowds in Hamburg, I'll be the one in the &lt;i&gt;oranje&lt;/i&gt; colored shirt not celebrating wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I understand there's a match in the other bracket today as well, but since it's only going to be shown on pay-TV in Germany, I can't really say that much about it. I guess it can't be all that important.&lt;/p&gt;

Good news for German bloggers, and especially for J√∂rg Kantel (aka Der Schockwellenreiter). After a phone call between J√∂rg and a representitive of the Suhrkamp Verlag, the cease-and-dissist letter has been withdrawn, including the demand for legal fees. The Kantels are now free to spend the &amp;euro;1200 as they wish... for example, on their dog Zebu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of which links are legal in Germany and which are not is still open. There are previous cases of FTPExplorer/SelfHTML and the Hamburg ruling requiring disclaimers for outside links are not particularly comforting. But American bloggers  have similar problems, for example  National Public Radio  requiring &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2002/06/19#NDozMzoyNSBBTQdbdb&quot;&gt;permisssion&lt;/a&gt; for links.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/05/31&quot;&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; over the upcoming Walser novel has now become a weblog controversy. As I &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/06/13&quot;&gt;alluded&lt;/a&gt; to before, the author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/&quot;&gt;Der Schockwellenreiter&lt;/a&gt; on Friday was  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/06/14.html#a6048&quot;&gt;served&lt;/a&gt; with a cease-and-desist letter  (in German, an &lt;i&gt;Abmahnung&lt;/i&gt;) by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.suhrkamp.de/&quot;&gt;Walser's publisher&lt;/a&gt; to remove a link to a pirate pdf copy of the novel, as well as a demand that he pay the legal costs of producing the letter, some &amp;euro;1200. The pdf had been sent by the publisher itself to journalists as advance review copies, and one of those copies found its way onto the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/06/15.html#a6068&quot;&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/06/15.html#a6069&quot;&gt;literally&lt;/a&gt; dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/06/16.html#a6084&quot;&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; blogs, and also the mainstream &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heise.de&quot;&gt;Heise&lt;/a&gt; News Ticker &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/ghi-16.06.02-000/&quot;&gt;&quot;Suhrkamp mahnt Weblog wegen Walser-Roman ab&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. While the pdf itself was clearly illegal, is simply linking to it illegal as well? Wasn't the publisher acting irresponsibly in respect to its own copyright by sending out unsolicited copies to journalists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having to pay for just being threatened to be sued may seem to be strange concept. The Register printed an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/20431.html&quot;&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt; of German &lt;i&gt;Abmahnungen&lt;/i&gt; a while back. The procedure is meant to be used in commercial disputes, not against private individuals. Maybe with enough publicity, Suhrkamp will withdraw the demand for legal fees.&lt;/p&gt;

Any price. Although I'm sure with his parent-beating, hair-pulling, tantrum-thrhowing, sand-tossing, I-have-no-idea-what-I-want antics, they'd bring him right back and demand a refund.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm still using &lt;a href=&quot;http://ranchero.com/php/rollingreferers/&quot;&gt;Brent's code&lt;/a&gt;, but added a MAX(d) column to the SQL query, and sort on it: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German &lt;a href=&quot;http://flagr.antville.org/20020610/63363/&quot;&gt;flagrant blogger&lt;/a&gt; posted this, so I guess the humor can't be &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; politically incorrect to post. The FDP is considering legal action against the magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Old Elbtunnel To Be Closed?</title>

Not to be confused with the Autobahn Elbtunnel, the toll tunnel runs 0,426 km and connects the Landungsbr√ºcken with the Blohm &amp;amp; Voss shipyard on the island of Steinwerder. The tunnel was built in 1911 and is an engineering marvel even today. Elevators at each side lower vehicles into the narrow tunnel. Howver, traffic is down 50% since 1995. and tolls cover only a fraction of the cost of personnel (as the elevators are not automated) and maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tunnel is a tourist landmark, and we make sure we show it to our visitors. On weekends the tunnel is often closed for cultural event. like art shows, film festivals and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photoloader.com/events/elbtunnel.asp&quot;&gt;even&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://elbtunnelmarathon.de/&quot;&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt; (48 laps). If you remember the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.imdb.com/Title?0071935&quot;&gt;The Odessa File&lt;/a&gt; with Jon Voight, the tunnel chase scene was filmed there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dave &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2002/06/06/isItMarketingOrJournalism&quot;&gt;&quot;Is it marketing or journalism?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and Karl &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paradox1x.org/mt/archives/000039.shtml#000039&quot;&gt;&quot;INDEED&quot;&lt;/a&gt; seem to be talking past one another. Dan Gilmor's column (or any Knight-Ridder outlet) would in fact be the very last place I'd expect to see criticism (objective or otherwise) of Knight-Ridder's online presence. If it appeared, I wouldn't believe it anyway, because I'd think a) he's about to get fired, and he's venting off steam in his final column, or b) Knight-Ridder has something up their sleeve, and the criticism is a marketing ploy. The ethical thing is for a journalist to stay quiet about his employer, since he cannot report on them objectively, and leave the reporting to outsiders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Gilmor's online work belongs not to him, but to Knight-Ridder, and Knight-Ridder has every right to throw out all old web pages of his work. It's stupid, of course, but would be typical for a industry where yesterday's product is used to line bird cages.  I'm sure they either thought they could make money on their archives, or that it wasn't worth the bother to preserve the old links. But it's unfair to expect Dan to make any comment on that in his column, or even Karl in his weblog, for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, Dave's real point, that we cannot trust the media industry as a whole to report on itself, is well taken.&lt;/p&gt;

Those who mention it at all tend to  snicker at the colleagues/classmates/family who waste time with such things. To follow the national team is like an American saying he watches the Super Bowl. Or, an even better comparison, like an American who follows the Olympics and cheers for the USA. So I won't say anything about Germany-Ireland, except to say I now (along with most of my co-workers) have 90 minutes of work time to make up somehow. And that Ireland's tying goal was deserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we're losing another colleague at work (they're buying a house in the country and she wants to have another baby), and we've elected an elections board, the first step on a long road in installing a worker's council (which seems to entail all of the bureaucracy and internal politics of a union, but without the dues).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/radioMacrosHeadLinks&quot;&gt;Userland&lt;/a&gt; is starting to give links to blogroll files (in OPML).  At &lt;a href=&quot;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02.html#google_recommends&quot;&gt;diveintomark&lt;/a&gt; Mark Pilgrim is showing a script that can parse OPML blogroll files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question: I've started using my favorites at &lt;a href=&quot;blo.gs&quot;&gt;blo.gs&lt;/a&gt; as my blogroll. They also offer an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blo.gs/184/favorites.opml&quot;&gt;OPML version&lt;/a&gt;. If I give this file as my blogroll link, will these tools be able to read it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin at &lt;a href=&quot;http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/&quot;&gt;Traumwind&lt;/a&gt; is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://traumwind.tierpfad.de/blog/?detail=2002-06-03_09-08&quot;&gt;trying out bl.ogs&lt;/a&gt; for his blogroll, but he prefers RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt;: I now see the answer was already at &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/06/03#discoveringMyBlogneighborhood&quot;&gt;today's Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Note that it's totally cool to use a different outliner to create your blogroll, as long as it produces an OPML file with an HTTP url, the macro will be able to find it and the weblog will point to it through the head links. I've asked that blogrolling.com support an OPML version of the rolls it creates.&quot; So I'll add the blogroll &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; and see if anyone complains.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday I put in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/05/27/index.php#001739&quot;&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt; script, which I adapted from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://philringnalda.com/phpblogroll/&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; by Phil Ringnalda. After seeing me in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diveintomark.org&quot;&gt;Mark's&lt;/a&gt; referrers, he was &lt;a href=&quot;http://philringnalda.com/archives/002219.php&quot;&gt;reminded&lt;/a&gt; of my link and that that his script was &lt;a href=&quot;http://philringnalda.com/archives/001908.php&quot;&gt;inspired&lt;/a&gt; by my old article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$778&quot;&gt;blogrolling with php alone&lt;/a&gt; (which in turn was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.curry.com&quot;&gt;Adam Curry&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.curry.com/discuss/msgReader$801#theBlogRollingMacro&quot;&gt;blog rolling Frontier macro&lt;/a&gt; (and who  I think originated the term 'blogrolling' ). Anyway, this post is just to further complicate the tangled web of links, and to remind me that I, too, need a linkback script of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Don't Read This Book, Film At 11</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Americans will wonder at this... the lead story on last night's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tagesthemen.de&quot;&gt;late news&lt;/a&gt; was about.... literature. And they went on and on, for at least 10 minutes. In short, the FAZ is refusing to publish the new novel by Martin Walser, &quot;Death of a Critic&quot;, because they say it is anti-Semitic and that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FFE-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&amp;amp;doc={9F018D5D-01B5-46D4-9D65-290CA8EE3CBE}&quot;&gt;dead critic is intended to be the real-life FAZ critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki&lt;/a&gt;. The publisher could not have orchestrated a better PR campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how much the typical German viewer cares about Walser and Reich-Ranicki, but I guess this was better than seeing yet another panic story about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?x39453821&quot;&gt;Nitrofen scandal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Like Christmas and Easter it comes &lt;a href=&quot;/2000/05/14/&quot;&gt;every&lt;/a&gt; year (although last year I seem not to have mentioned it), and doesn't really change at all (except that this year it is in Estonia, which is somewhat unique). Some people take it seriously, but most don't. The German entry this year is supposed to be quite good (according to British bookmakers), but what chance does Germany have to win a European-wide phone-in popularity contest, no matter what the field?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; My taste must be becoming European. My two favorites, Malta and Latvia, finished second and first. The German performance was quite flat, and finished near the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we hang out with the wrong crowd, but TV series are not a topic of conversion for us or anyone we know. Our schedules are so chaotic, we couldn't manage to follow a series even if we wanted to. I guess that's called real life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today. we found that no, we weren't dreaming, indeed the layoffs were true, for reasons of cost-cutting, not communicated to the staff (I knew because our department talks to one another after hours) and chosen arbitrary (my department head was not informed, I'm sure he would have not chosen his most senior admin for the boot). They were not communicated in one-to-one meetings, as one would expect, but instead dropped anonymously into the employees' home mailboxes on Friday afternoon. And this is supposed to motivate us remaining employees to pull ourselves out of the crisis? Hardly. Stay-at-home fatherhood is looking better all the time. The mood is miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the end of the work day on Friday, my employer without warning laid off ca. 10% of the development, support and technical staff. (Typical notice for German salaried employees is 6 weeks before the end of the quarter, so Friday was D-Day for the end of June.) My dept was also hit; my office mate, a Sr Systems Manager who has been with the company since it was founded, was among those let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came totally out of the blue. This week we had announced a new customer and 1st quarter numbers (a slight loss). I don't know whether this is the beginning of the death spiral for the company, or if management just decided to get rid of some people they don't like. Neither possibility is pleasant to think about, and Tuesday (Monday is a holiday) will be an interesting work day, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Even here in Germany people are talking about whether the Bush Administration was warned before 9/11. (I've read blogs about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldwideklein.de/?id=P175_0_3_0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20020517&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2002/05/17&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) But I can't imagine what good it would have done, say, for the government to have known a couple of weeks ahead of time what was going to happen, without knowing exactly when, where and who, without somehow convincing the public of the seriousness of the threat. The airlines and the public would have never gone along with the security measures necessary, especially considering the false alarms in the past. Or am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the public was convinced, they were a thousand times more effective than any government action would have been, as shown by the passengers of AA Flight 93. They took action within minutes. The government, it seems, takes months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; I forgot to mention, remember that the Hamburg flat of Atta et al. was searched by police the very evening of 9/11, less than 6 hours after the attacks. That made it pretty clear that somebody knew something ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Extremely strange but true: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2002/05/15.html&quot;&gt;Der Schockwellenreiter&lt;/a&gt; J√∂rg Kantel (perhaps Germany's best known blogger,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://focus.de/F/2002/19/Internet/tagebuecher/tagebuecher.htm&quot;&gt;recently profiled&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.focus.de&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/a&gt; magazine) found out that some people are too dumb to use Google. To sum up in English: His boss was sent a mail asking why his institute employs a pedophile named Erik M√∂ller as IT head. But there is no Erik M√∂ller employed there, and the IT head is J√∂rg. What happened? Erik M√∂ller is a journalist who wrote a story &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/inhalt/co/4158/1.html&quot;&gt;'Children are Pornography'&lt;/a&gt; on the politcs of censorship in Germany. The said nitwit did a Google Search on 'Erik M√∂ller p√§dophil&quot;, which pointed to an entry in J√∂rg's forum (citing a different article by Mr. M√∂ller). The dumbhead thought that J√∂rg's picture was that of Mr. M√∂ller. clicked to reach J√∂rg's resume, and mailed the accusation to his employer. J√∂rg is considering legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson. Some people believe everything they think they read in the Internet, and cannot be distinguished from idiots.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://davespicks.com/archive/2002/0514.html&quot;&gt;Dave's Picks&lt;/a&gt; says that although I may feel less safe in Europe now, he felt a whole lot unsafer when visiting behind the Iron Curtain, back when there was a Iron Curtain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can count days correcty, we must have been in Phoenix the same time as &lt;a href=&quot;http://booknotes.weblogs.com/2002/05/14&quot;&gt;Craig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still bouncing my workstation back and forth between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; Linux and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;. I can't run &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.activestate.com/komodo&quot;&gt;komodo&lt;/a&gt; under FreeBSD, but there's no &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org&quot;&gt;kde3&lt;/a&gt; ready for Debian yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was my first day back at the office. QM is complaining that their Mac (a 3-1/2 year old G3)  is too slow to test anything on, so maybe we'll be getting a nice G4 with OSX after all. But I doubt if we Unix bigots will ever let a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/xserve/&quot;&gt;Xserve&lt;/a&gt; in our server room.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dutch Elections, Fortuyn and Schill</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/05/13/dutch-elections-fortuyn-and-schill/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/05/13/dutch-elections-fortuyn-and-schill</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For background in English on the elections in Holland on Wednesday, you might want to check out the Netherlands edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatica.com/index.asp?s=0&quot;&gt;Expatica&lt;/a&gt;, a community website for expatriates with an extensive news section. I'll ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://live.curry.com&quot;&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; if he thinks the stories there are any good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also surprised not to have seen any comparisons of Fortuyn with Germany's political maverick, Hamburg's Interior Senator &quot;Judge Merciless&quot; Ronald Schill. They have a number of surface similarities: both are celebrities new to politics, right of center without being radical right, founding parties that bear their names. However, Schill's celebrity is local to Hamburg, and his law-and-order platform is tailored for urban voters. Although his party pulled 4% in Sachsen-Anhalt last month, he doesn't have national ambitions, at least not for this year (he's supporting Stoiber). And Schill is nowhere near as charismatic as Fortuyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schill-partei.de/&quot;&gt;Schill Party website&lt;/a&gt; is in German only, but it does have a picture of the good judge, and you can decide for yourself whether he would look any better with a Pim Fortuyn haircut.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>This and That from Phoenix</title>

   <updated>2002-05-11T09:05:59+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/05/11/this-and-that-from-phoenix</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our dream is to return to the Southwest someday, but it won't be anytime soon. Mama's employer restructured in the US last year, and no longer has a regional office in Phoenix (merging with Denver). Since Mama is a Regional Manager, moving to Phoenix via her employer is out (Denver is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; an acceptable alternative). But we looked at a nice abobe-style townhouse anyway, just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed with Mama's old boss, who still has a job but no longer an office (see above). Instead she has a lot of lonely travel and is somewhat jaded on the company. Our other friend has worked for 3 different oil/convenience store companies in the past year without changing her desk. But she's happy. We all went to a D-Backs game our last night. We had fun, and they won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAX sucks for catching connections, especially with a stroller. To switch terminals, you have to go outside and wait for a crowded non-accessable bus. FRA was almost as bad; no bus, but a maze of twisty tunnels, all alike. AMS or even KEF in Iceland are much nicer. Our domestic flights with America West, however, went very well, despite our &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/03/25&quot;&gt;fears before booking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I be worried that it is now past noon, and Christopher is &lt;b&gt;still&lt;/b&gt; sleeping?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unlike Mama, who spent her vacation reading mysteries, I got myself the two new PHP books from O'Reilly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/progphp/&quot;&gt;Programming PHP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/webdbapps/&quot;&gt;Web Database Applications&lt;/a&gt;. They are both worthwhile, although the Database book is more in tune with what I am doing, while Programming PHP is more of an introduction. For various reasons, PHP 4 is becoming my main tool at work (although perl still plays a big role). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure Mama had more fun with her reading, though.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Feeling Less Safe</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/05/10/feeling-less-safe/"/>
   <updated>2002-05-10T02:05:37+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/05/10/feeling-less-safe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pardon my insomnia-induced ramblings, but events the past two weeks have fundamentally changed my feelings about living in Europe. &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/05/10/index.php#001720&quot;&gt;I no longer feel safe...&lt;/a&gt; at least I no longer feel safer here than in the US.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(I've got to add links and do some editing, but I wanted to get this posted before going back to bed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 12 years I have lived in Europe, I have always taken it as a given that I would feel physically safer here than in the US. In the 80s we lived in Minneapolis, just as the gangs started moving in (see Prince: Sign O' The Times), and Mpls later became the murder capital of the US, at least for a couple of years. We then moved to Phoenix, where the large transient population (not in the sense of being homeless, but in the sense of having just come to town and being very likely to soon leave) does not engender a feeling of security. We were transient, too; we stayed just 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supposed feeling of security isn't really based on actual experience, by the way. At work, Mama has had to deal with much more crime here in Germany than in the States (but that's because in the States she handled only a couple of locations, but now she has hundreds). And only in Germany did I personally know a murder victim. But never mind that. I thought the statistics on crime rates, gun ownership, etc. backed up my feeling that I was safer here than back in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not now. I do not feel safer in Europe anymore. First there was 9/11, but everyone knows about that, and I won't dwell on it. And then, while we were away for two weeks on vacation, two things happened that changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First was the school shooting in Erfurt. Violent acts in German schools isn't new, there have been a few such crimes the past decade, but this was particularly awful in its scale. It shows that controlling gun ownership doesn't prevent acts like this, and that Europe is not immune to the media culture of violence that seems to prevail in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the shooting of Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, 9 days before national elections. I'm not real up on Dutch politics, see Adam Curry for more details, but Pim Fortuyn was apparently on the verge of making a national impact in The Netherlands, and was murdered for his beliefs. And that scares me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That scares more than neo-fascists like Le Pen or Haider. It scares me more than any of their small-time ilk in Germany or any place else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream German politics has always tiptoed around the issue of immigration, claiming that it was &quot;too dangerous&quot; to politicize the issue, as if they thought enough Germans so small brained to start rioting against foreigners when the subject was merely mentioned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I guess it is dangerous to even mention certain subjects. And now I feel less safe.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher's chicken pox seems to be winding down. The fever has been gone for 24 hours, and the blisters are starting to dry up. It looks like his infliction was milder than normal (maybe because of good nursing from RN Grandma). And he might be caught up with his sleep again. And he's not contagious anymore, so we might be able to arrange that visit.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Chicken Pox</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/04/21/chicken-pox</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Las Vegas last evening, tired and cranky. And, for Christopher, with chicken pox. It was going around at day care two weeks ago, and we noticed the first blisters and a fever while on the plane. He's not that uncomfortable yet, but he must be highly contagious. So it probably won't be a good idea for us to visit Ian today. I've got the first nap duty, so I'm with him in the room trying out the cable modem at the hotel :-). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://kidshealth.org/parent/infections/skin/chicken_pox.html&quot;&gt;Here's&lt;/a&gt; everything you never wanted to know about chicken pox. Christopher is at starting to itch, but is still in relatively good spirits. He was up from midnight until exactly 5:18 am (with Mama's wake-up call at 6:30). Do I get extra Papa Points for staying up with him? Let's just say it would have been a hell of a lot more convenient to be going through this at home!&lt;/p&gt;

He's already excited about &quot;Flugzeuge&quot; and &quot;airplanes&quot;. Then again, he's excited about anything large and motorized, like bulldozers (&quot;Bagger!&quot;) and tractors (&quot;Trecker!&quot;). I'll try to drop notes here from time to time.

   <title>Not In My Backyard</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/24924.html&quot;&gt;The Register: Deutsche Bahn sues Google over anarchist links&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.nothingbutthetruth.de/archives/000776.shtml#000776&quot;&gt;Nothing But The Truth [en-US]&lt;/a&gt;). The background is the regular shipments by rail of highly concentrated nuclear waste in (supposedly) highly secure Castor containers to a (supposedly) temporary storage facility at Gorleben near L√ºneburg. The shipments are accompanied by protests, massive police presence, actions to block the tracks, and the occasional act of sabotage. (I've mentioned my admiration of the &lt;a href=&quot;/2001/03/28/&quot;&gt;armoured garbage trucks&lt;/a&gt; before, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?as_q=castor+gorleben&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;as_epq=&amp;amp;as_oq=&amp;amp;as_eq=&amp;amp;lr=lang_en&amp;amp;as_ft=i&amp;amp;as_filetype=&amp;amp;as_qdr=all&amp;amp;as_occt=any&amp;amp;as_dt=i&amp;amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;amp;safe=images&quot;&gt;a Google search on Castor and Gorleben in English&lt;/a&gt; will find lots of further information.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm all for free speech and all that, but there are only three rail routes to L√ºneburg, one of which goes through my town, and if anarchists would like to derail a Castor train as proof of concept that the shipments are unsafe, I'd much rather they do it as far away from my house as possible. For example, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citypaper.com/2002-02-20/mobs.html&quot;&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/text/2002/feb/12/513027050.html&quot;&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A fourth? A third? Half? I suspect my employer needs a OSX-capable machine to test our products, but I don't have any numbers to back up my suspicion. We're all Unix geeks who have no clue about Macs. Feel free to leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Thanks to Garret for the link, and welcome to a couple of new folks who left comments. I should also be a bit more specific. My employer sells server software for home banking and brokerage, so I'm really interested in how many folks would use OSX for home banking with a web browser (either with a login/password or a key stored on diskette or chipcard).&lt;/p&gt;

Especially passages like &quot;they began to shoot, firing low to make sure they hit the children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

We could charge what it's worth, but who could afford to pay?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &quot;Tagesm√ºtter&quot; (translates as &quot;day mother&quot;, the dry translation is &quot;in-home day care provider&quot;) (there are also &quot;Tagesv√§ter&quot; but they are rare...) has 20 years of professional experience, she teaches and certifies in-home day care providers, founded the state board and is on the national board of in-home day care, and is politically active on the national level on behalf of her profession. (And when she's out politicking, she arranges a substitute at no charge.) Her hourly rate is 25 cents per hour higher than average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so you know what you could expect if you change professions :-)&lt;/p&gt;

The camp was burnt down by the British just weeks after it was liberated. Today it's just a field with mounds, a couple dozen in all. Each mound is a mass grave. Each mound represents tens of thousands of victims. The last time we were there, it was a cloudy, gloomy day, and we could hear gunfire from nearby troops on exercise. Eerie.&lt;/p&gt;

I found that it's not quite the cats meow, not yet, and I recommended that we wait for an update with bugfixes and then try it again. Display of fonts (rather important for Office documents) just isn't quite good enough yet for daily use on a relatively current machine (Mandrake 8,1), and I couldn't get fonts to display right at all on an older installation (Mandrake 7.x) . It's promising, and I'll keep an eye on it, even if it's not quite usable yet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ants and Toilet Paper</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have ants in our house again. They were here this time last year too. They seem to like canned cat food. So they are all over the cat dish in the entryway. Mama noticed this early this morning, took the ant-infested cat dish outside, and put a new dish in the kitchen. The ants took this as an invitation to come to the kitche, so by the time Christopher and I woke up, the ants were in there. And in the living room. But I found where they are coming from. They can run back in their hole, but they can't hide forever. I have a can of bug spray, and I'm not afraid to use it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we have discovered that we are out of toilet paper. In a household where all lives revolve around a two-year-old, practical necessities sometimes get forgotten. After all, Christopher doesn't need it yet. He does use toilet paper, as &lt;a href=&quot;/2001/11/25&quot;&gt;we mentioned a few months ago&lt;/a&gt;, but as we noted at the time, he doesn't follow the manufacturer's operating instructions. Unfortunately, this not being the land of unlimited possibilities, we cannot take care of this need online. There is no &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.klopapier24.de&quot;&gt;www.klopapier24.de&lt;/a&gt; (there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.klopapier.de&quot;&gt;www.klopapier.de&lt;/a&gt;, but it's more of an artistic than a commerce site).  I have, however, set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mailtothefuture.com&quot;&gt;Mail To The Future&lt;/a&gt; to send me a mail tomorrow afternoon to remind me stop at the toilet paper store on my way home from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I shouldn't have dismissed the online possibility so quickly: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.budni.de/cgi-bin/home/katalog?go=treffer&amp;amp;such=toi+pap&quot;&gt;Budnikowski&lt;/a&gt; has a toilet paper page and so does &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.schlecker.de&quot;&gt;Schlecker&lt;/a&gt; (under Haushalt-&amp;gt;Papier und Folie)!&lt;/p&gt;

The demo has been very nice, much improved from version 4 that came with my FireWire card, and I think I'll end up buying it. So maybe we can finally start sending video CDs to Grandma and Grandpa, like we've been promising for months. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've seen plenty of Linux magazines at gas stations and supermarkets, but when buying groceries this evening I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.php-mag.de/&quot;&gt;PHP Magazin&lt;/a&gt;. I picked it up, so I can now say that everything I know about computing I could have learned at the supermarket. Well, almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing like a little bread and salt to make a new place feel like home. Hal also wins the award for first post, er actually &lt;a href=&quot;/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1678&quot;&gt;first comment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is still the MT default, all CSS and standards-conformant. I'm working on implementing the happy stripes from the old design in CSS, if for nothing else to look a little different from all the other MT sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks again to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.userland.com&quot;&gt;UserLand&lt;/a&gt; for hosting PapaScott on Manila for over 2 years, and best of luck with all the new ventures that seem to be on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Party's over, it's back to work today after the four-day weekend. One thing I'll be checking out at the office is the new Codeweavers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeweavers.com/products/office/&quot;&gt;CrossOver Office&lt;/a&gt;. Our developers all run Linux, but need Windows for Notes and to view the occasional Word document (they don't need full MS Office licenses). We've been running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citrix.com&quot;&gt;Citrix&lt;/a&gt; servers up to now, but that's expensive and they tend to max out at 25 users. If CrossOver works out, we might get a few dozen licenses to run Notes clients. And if &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com&quot;&gt;Radio&lt;/a&gt; will work with it, I'll get one for home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Citrix, I finally got the Citrix client to work on FreeBSD. I should have known, it's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freshports.org/port-description.php3?port=201&quot;&gt;port&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's Christopher with his Easter Rabbit he got from Oma. It's made of bread, so he's having it for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we didn't get around to searching for Easter eggs yesterday, we did it this morning. Christopher didn't see the point of hard boiled eggs at first, but finding a chocolate bunny made the adventure worthwhile. We've still got 2 packages of Kinder chocolate that he got as presents for Easter. We'll have to try to parcel them out as slowly as we can.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the weather was gorgeous. Christopher was able to spend the whole day outside. With Bobby Car races with neighbor Carolin, a bike ride to the playground, &quot;helping&quot; Mama in the garden, he kept busy all day too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case anybody is wondering, Europe is already on Daylight Savings Time as of yesterday. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker&quot;&gt;Blogtracker&lt;/a&gt; is out of whack!&lt;/p&gt;

And then all Radio users being required to use AOL to update their blogs? And that AOL is after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; as well? Weblogs as AOL Premium Content, visible only to AOL subscribers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a dark future we're looking at here.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>(Most Of ) The Gritty Details</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/03/31/most-of-the-gritty-details/"/>
   <updated>2002-03-31T19:03:48+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/03/31/most-of-the-gritty-details</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case anyone is wondering, here are the details of how I moved my Manila website to Moveable Type&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main step, as I mentioned a few days ago, was to get XML files for my Manila site. There's a TheXmlFiles tool for Radio 7 that can produce these, but it does not work for Radio 8. I downloaded Radio 7 from the same directory where Radio 8 is located (there's no link for it on the Radio website, as far as I can tell), and installed it in a separate directory from Radio 8. It produced a directory full of XML files, as described in the documentation for TheXmlFiles, which I zipped and copied over to my BSD machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to process these files with Perl, but my perl tools complained about the special characters in the XML files, since I used German umlauts in several of my posts. The standard character set for XML is Unicode, but the umlauts were saved as Latin1, so I converted the XML files to Unicode with 'recode latin1..utf8'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manila produces a discussion group message for each post, comment and image on the site. For now, I only wanted to import the main posts into my new site. The file homePageCalendar.xml lists the message number of the main post for each day. With the script &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/03/xmlexport.txt&quot;&gt;xmlexport.pl&lt;/a&gt;. for each of these posts, I extracted the post date, title, and body into the text format used by MoveableType.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Manila, you can put image or link names in quotes to expand to a so-called glosary entry. The message files have these names in quotes, and they need to be expanded to the full image or link. I did this by running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/03/xmlglossary.txt&quot;&gt;xmlglossary.pl&lt;/a&gt; on the output from above. The image references now all refer to the Manila site. I uploaded all images to a directory on my new site, and search-and-replaced all references to refer to the new directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of problems I had to correct by hand. One day's entry had no text, so I simply deleted it from the homePageCalendar.xml file. One of the message xml files has a ctrl-S character that brought the scripts to a halt. I deleted it by hand, and everything ran smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Postscript 2002-04-13&lt;/b&gt; Chris Kelly notes that my scripts work if your content are all 'stories'. If you use Manila's news option, the content is stored differently and you'll need to adjust the script.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my tries to produce XML files of this website, the obvious answer finally hit me this evening. If I'm trying to get a tool for Radio 7 to work, the thing to do is to download and install Radio 7. I've now got a folder of all the files I need. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2002/03/25#MTowODowNyBQTQdbdb&quot;&gt;Cookies for breakfast?&lt;/a&gt; Christopher's currently on a pickle kick. I guess that's not quite as bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doc calls America West &lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/03/23#americaWaste&quot;&gt;&quot;America Waste&quot;&lt;/a&gt; after an ill-fated check-in from LAX to Phoenix. I wanted us to take America West LAX-LAS-PHX-LAX next month. After flying 12 hours from Frankfurt with a 2-year-old, do we really want to endure a check-in from hell? But AmWest costs half as much as the competition, even cheaper than Southwest. Decisions, decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've stayed in FreeBSD since Monday. My system is usable, but not yet complete. My problems so far have been the java plugin for Mozilla (crashes on the Domino mail applet) and finding a Citrix client (Linux version runs under emulation, but doesn't encrypt so I can't log in).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Time to eat my own dog food, at least at home. I administer a number of FreeBSD servers at work, but I don't have experience with a FreeBD workstation or managing a complete selection of ports. Now I'm going to try to run FreeBSD on my main workstation at home, in place of Debian GNU/Linux. I actually tried this already last year, but got frustrated keeping my ports up-to-date over my ISDN line. Now that I know about the portupgrade utility, that should be a lot easier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already downloaded the 4 CD set for FreeBSD 4.5 at work. I can install a base system in my sleep, and after a couple of tries I got the standard XFree86 3.x going for my Elsa Gladiac graphic card and USB mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first packages I installed were cvsup (to keep my src and ports directories up-to-date), ncftp (to quickly find and download things) and portupgrade. I installed the kde packages from the CD (unfortunately, the supplementary kde packages are missing from the CD, so those I had to download). That gave me Konqueror and KMail, so I could surf and read mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then decided what basic programs I wanted to build ports for first, so I could download the distfiles overnight. I need browsers (mozilla, galeon), apache (with SSL, php, mod_perl), editors (vim, xemacs) and graphic tools (gimp, ImageMagick), and an up-to-date KDE. With 'portupgrade -NRF' (install new ports, plus all they depend on, fetch but do not build), I started downloading at 11pm, and it finished at 7:30, when Christopher I were eating breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the official spring opener. The patio table has been taken out of the shed and has been reassembled for your outdoor pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does a two-year-old know that it's the one day of the week his parents can sleep late, and wake up them at at 5:30?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to lose weight for the past week, but I have a feeling that the first pounds to go have been from my brain. First yesterday I bought a plane ticket from Lufthansa with the wrong return date, then today I managed to short-circuit the entire house. You see, the outtake hose on our washing machine sometimes clogs. I had to disconnect the hose, let it drain, clean out the filter, then restart the machine. Do you see the missing step? If so, you know how the connection to the extension cord got wet and tripped the main circuit breaker, which coincidentally is next to the washing machine. At least I had enough brain cells left to dry the floor before switching the power back on, otherwise I'd be sure to be up for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.DarwinAwards.com&quot;&gt;Darwin award&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's going to take me more than a couple weeks to lose weight, though. I'm going to be acting stupid for the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Flyte Tyme</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our travel needs are pretty simple. All we want to do is to fly to Las Vegas and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Mama has a business meeting is in Vegas, and we'll be staying in Phoenix for R&amp;amp;R afterwards, so we'd like to fly back from Phoenix. And since Mama's employer is paying for her ticket, she needs to book separately. And she has 100,000 Lufthansa frequent flyer miles, and we'd like to pay for my ticket with her miles. That's why we're booking so late... we had to wait for a PIN from Lufthansa. And that's also why we can't take BA through London, which would be cheaper if we had to pay for all the tickets ourselves (but would mean a ground transfer from Heathrow to Gatwick). There aren't enough miles to pay for Christopher, though, so we have to book him separately, as a child under 12, but not unaccompanied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lufthansa doesn't fly to Vegas, but we can fly in to Phoenix and take Southwest from there to Vegas, right? No, wait, there are no seats to Phoenix available as frequent flyer premium on the day we need to fly. Can we fly to Denver instead? No, flights from Denver to Vegas and Phoenix are too expensive. How about LAX? That works... we fly in to LAX, then America West to Vegas then on to Phoenix after Mama is done, all for &amp;euro;78 each, then take Lufthansa from Phoenix back home. So that's three HAM-LAX/PHX-HAM, one booked at work, one booked at Lufthansa Miles and More, and one child booked alone, and three LAX-LAS-PHX booked together at America West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That was the plan. In reality,&lt;/b&gt; the return flight from PHX was also closed as a premium flight. Mama had to call Lufthansa to set things right. So we fly through LAX on the way back as well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Strange, with Mozilla 0.9.9 I cannot flip my page... the http proxy says it cannot process my request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christopher crisis yesterday had to do with the volume of liquids. He wanted to drink his apple juice from a bottle rather than a plastic cup, and was extremely upset that 0.3 l juice from the cup did not fit into the 0.25 l bottle. He wanted all the juice in the bottle and none in the cup. It took me 15 minutes to come up with the idea to let the bottle overflow (into a bowl), so that that bottle was full and the cup was empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The (US) INS is the Mickey Mouse Club of federal agencies, but this... is an insult to Mickey Mouse.&quot; Mama always suspected this (it took them 4 tries to issue her a Green Card with her name spelled correctly), but now we know it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16787-2002Mar12.html&quot;&gt;true&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My folks are not only going to venture to the wilds of Las Vegas next month to see us, but they're now planning a trip to Europe this August/September with Christopher Ryan as the main attraction. They've already seen more of Europe than I have, but now they are going to take a chartered bus trip through Scandinavia, which starts in London and passes right through Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since they are going to see us after the bus trip, they are flying into Hamburg instead of London, and will join the bus tour here. Of course, their tour ends in London, so the interesting part will be to get them from London back here. Air travel in Europe is anything but cheap, but the no-frills &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ryanair.com&quot;&gt;RyanAir&lt;/a&gt; has a one-way deal London-Hamburg for &amp;pound;29.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, you have to include the parentheses: the flight is from London (Stansted) to Hamburg (L√ºbeck). Stansted is 56 km from central London, but one ca get there by bus or train. But saying Hamburg (L√ºbeck) is like saying San Francisco (Sacramento) or New York (Philadelphia). It's a ways out. But for &amp;pound;29.99 noone can complain.&lt;/p&gt;

It all started with Haider's campaign in Austria to block Czech entry to the EU. In an interview in response, Czech Prime Minister Zeman said that the Sudetendeutschen (expelled from Czechoslovakia in 1945) were all traitors loyal to Hitler. In the end both he and Schr√∂der have election campaigns and would just as soon avoid the expulsion issue (seeing as they each have opponents more hard line on the issue).

The decision (involving pork subsidies in Portugal) was rather minor, but was overturned for purely politcal reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
It's interesting in light of the ministers overturning the budget warning for Germany, and recent comments by European politicians that the Commission has become too powerful and that more European decision-making should be made at the national and regional level.&lt;br /&gt;
It's also interesting that I cannot find a single web link to this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milestone check for Christopher:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We recognized his first sentence yesterday, &quot;Nana essen&quot; (Eat banana), which of course has to do with eating. Earlier in the week he said &quot;Mama mehr&quot; (Mama more), which was disqualified for not having a verb.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This morning for the first time he seemed content to have his bath in the big bathtub, rather than the plastic baby tub. He's still not really having fun, but we figure he just needs some new tub toys.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's able to start a CD player by himself, but cannot distinguish among music CDs, data CDs, and DVDs (then again, who can without reading the labels?). He got very upset the other day when he couldn't listen to Shrek.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today he was able to climb onto the big slide at the McDonald's indoor playland by himself. It was almost impossible to drag him away.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's right in the middle of the terrible twos, what Germans call the &quot;Trotzphase&quot;, testing our authority and our limits. I gets loud sometimes.

   <title>Does This Stuff Come Off?</title>

&lt;p&gt;No, this isn't how I prepare for the televised Olympic coverage. We were invited to a 'Fasching' birthday party. I wasn't aware that we would be dressing up until the last minute, and this is what I came up with on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2002/02/fphmakeup.jpg&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; width=&quot;325&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;fphmakeup.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://moorbek.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;Moorbek&lt;/a&gt; had some intresting (albeit cynical) thoughts on the German Olympic success, which I'll loosely translate: &quot;We have two winter sports regions: the Alps and the Walachei in Th√ºrigen (you can't really count the Harz or the Black Forest). There live roughly 80,000 people. The German winter athletes are recruited from these 80,000 people, not from the 80 million German population. The succeses were all in endurance and strength disciplines (cross-country, speed skating). In the technical contests (alpine skiing, ice hockey, figure skating) the results were as usual. In cycling (Ullrich, Zabel), I had always wondered how long the DDR doping advantage would last. This was the wrong question, of course. The question should be, how do the trainers of today keep their athletes from being tested positive? The science of sport learned from German reunification. No proof, of course, but one can't help but notice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Staying home yesterday seemed to be good for Christopher. He slept a lot, until 8:30 in the morning and in the afternoon for over 3 hours, much than he would have at daycare. Now he's slept through the night for the first time in a week. And he woke up bright and healthy, so he spent a happy day at daycare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, it was the commute from hell. All the roads were iced up, plus there the Autobahn A1 was closed due to an accident, and all the traffic was re-routed through Buchholz. Since our daycare is in Buchholz, that meant I could drive in to drop off Christopher, but could not get out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive could have easily taken two hours. I couldn't even turn around to get back home. I decided to drive away from the Autobahn to the next village with a train station, and got to work in about 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day didn't improve any after I got to work, so I really would have been better off staying home.&lt;/p&gt;

September 11 and the war on terrorism has had virtually no effect on German politics. The SPD lost Hamburg on local issues, and the Schill 'Law and Order' Party is not overtly anti-immigrant. The NPD is not making political inroads anywhere, its political impact is nil. The losses of the Greens are not &lt;i&gt;despite&lt;/i&gt; the pro-war Fischer, but &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of him; he's undercutting the pacifist base. Stoiber is talking now as a national candidate much differently than he did as a state prime minister. He could make Euroskeptic noises when leading Bavaria, but not now as a national leader. He's not in the same boat as Haider. And eastern Germany is not particularly pro-Stoiber. Eastern voters tend to vote all over the map, and with only 18% of the vote, will not be a critical factor this fall.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Consortium of Committees</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher's still asleep, so I don't know yet if he's well enough for me to go to work. &lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; He's still got a fever, so we're home watching Kinderkanal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the lights went out here (and many thanks to UserLand for letting us know what was going on; much better information than any pay provider I've dealt with), I was explaining about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/2002/02/17&quot;&gt;Olympics on German TV&lt;/a&gt;. First first a quick primer on German public broadcasting...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two German public networks have very different personalities. They're both governed by the states (or L√§nder), who also regulate private broadcasting and determine the monthly broadcast fees for listeners and viewers (and if you smell potential conflicts of interest, you're right). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, ZDF is run by a committee of civil servents, while ARD is run by a consortium of committees of civil servents. Alles klar? The ZDF (Zweite Deutsche Fernsehen) is a single organization based in Mainz that does only national television. The ARD (Allgemeine Rundfunkanstalten Deutschlands... try saying that 3 times fast) is a consortium of the regional public broadcasters, each of which do regional television and radio and then try to agree which programs get broadcast nationally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/literature/broadcst.htm&quot; title=&quot;Broadcasting Law in Germany&quot;&gt;By law&lt;/a&gt; the public broadcasters have a duty to present diverse opinions, and are governed to insure 'internal plurality'. In practice this means that the two networks present a very institutional view of Germany and the world, with the views of parties, unions, big business and the church in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does all this have to do with the Olympics? Well, I said that the ARD covrage was somewhat better. This is because the Bavarian regional broadcasters are in charge of the ARD coverage, and since Bavaria is the center of winter sport in Germany, they have a somewhat better perspective on winter sport than their ZDF colleagues from Mainz. The Bavarians also made the comment about the sport of Wei√übier, which sounds like a good sport for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2001/09/07&quot;&gt;Alwin&lt;/a&gt; and me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher was really under the weather yesterday, 40&amp;deg;C fever and coughing, but somewhat better today. We're staying inside, which is a shame with the fine sunny winter weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't sound like that anyone in the States is happy with the Olympic TV coverage, especially those on the West Coast where everything has been tape-delayed. Here in Germany, the main coverage has been split between the two public networks, ARD and ZDF, switching every evening (as is usual for big sports events like the Olympics, World and European Cup, or World Track and Field Championships). We're 8 hours ahead of Salt Lake City, so the coverage begins about 4pm, the early afternoon events are in prime time, the hard core can keep watching until 5 or 6am. The multilingual satellite channel Eurosport has 24-hour coverage, showing mostly repeats. The digital pay-TV network Prmiere World has 5 sports channels devoted to the Olympics, but we don't subscribe, so we don't have any details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARD and ZDF are governed by politicians and financed by monthly fees paid by all TV owners. They can only show commercials between 6 and 8pm, the Olympics are no exception. (&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/02/20&quot;&gt;I explained more later&lt;/a&gt;.) Usually ARD is more stodgy and ZDF more modern, but this time the ARD has the better and more entertaining coverage. They both concentrate on German athletes, of course, and on the traditional sports where the Germans are most successful: luge/bobsled, nordic and alpine skiing, and speed skating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlights of the German coverage so far have been on ARD: Katja Seitzinger teaching Katharina Witt how to ski (and, vice versa, how to skate) and the Bavarian commentator admitting that the only sport being performed at the studio was pouring Wei√übier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sportwise, the surprise German medals (biathlon and cross-country come to mind) and the 3000 meter skating duel between Friesinger and Pechstein have been the most fun to watch. Like Friesinger, many favorites for gold have been only to win the tin medal... 4th place. &lt;i&gt;F√ºr Vierte gibt's nur Blech!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For the first time, he wanted to come to our bed. We let him fall asleep there, then brought him back down. We don't want to start anything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, by the time I got back to sleep it was time to get up already, so I could have just as well skipped it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher and I just had a scare. We were almost home from daycare, already in L√ºllau. I could see our neighbor was cutting trees, tall ones. What I didn‚Äôt know was that the tree being cut right then was half rotted and was falling in the wrong direction‚Ä¶ toward the highway! It landed right in front of my car. It didn‚Äôt touch us, we were able to stop in time, and we weren‚Äôt hurt. I‚Äôm sure our neighbor was more shocked and surprised than we were.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All three crises are still bubbling.&lt;br /&gt;
The number of informants in the &lt;b&gt;NPD scandal&lt;/b&gt; is up to 5, maybe 6, and there are more and more calls from FDP and CDU to drop the case.&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile, in the &lt;b&gt;job placement scandal&lt;/b&gt;, reports are that Arbeitsamt head Jagoda was informed of irregularites 4 years ago, and other reports that he ordered his investigators to refute the current charges, rather than to see if they were true.  He's not a political appointee, but he's probably on the way out.&lt;br /&gt;
And in Brussels, Schr√∂der may have avoided a formal &lt;b&gt;EU budget warning&lt;/b&gt;, but at the cost of a lot of bad blood in the Commission and the smaller member countries.&lt;br /&gt;

Hamburg's 'Judge Merciless' makes national headlines again, but now on the defensive. Celebrity parties where cocaine was seen, bodyguards with Mafia ties, and now a sworn statement that he rubbed 'white powder' on his gums. He calls the TV report a 'pig magazine' and swears to have his hair analyzed. Shades of Christoph Daum, and Schill has the same wild look in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't turned into a troll or an ogre, not yet. &lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; Hold on, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/2002/02/09&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; turned into an ogre after all.

The German white stocking caps with the long earlappers looked silly, I thought. The Olympics are crassly commercial and nationalistic, of course, but there are far worse ways to vent off such things. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://hal.editthispage.com/2002/02/08&quot;&gt;Hal&lt;/a&gt;, I enjoyed the oversized animal puppets. Seeing the US hockey team light the flame reminded me of February 1980, when they won the gold medal, and I had just started seeing a German exchange student in the next town.&lt;/p&gt;

Both Stoiber and Schr√∂derhave an interest in saving Kirch, since Kirch is in &amp;euro;2BN deep to the half-state-owned Bayerische Landesbank, and Schr√∂der certainly wouldn't want to see an arch-conservative Murdoch (or Berlusconi) on the German airwaves.&lt;br /&gt;
The entertainment programming on Kirch's ProSieben already looks like a Fox Deutschland, though.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I haven't found an English link  yet, but the main national story today is a study of government 'Arbeits√§mter' (Employment Offices) by the federal 'Rechnungshof'. In the study, some 70% of job referrals claimed by the Arbeits√§mter were 'incorrect', meaning the job seeker found the job by himself. So if the Arbeits√§mter are not finding jobs for the unemployed, what &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; they doing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Update&lt;/b&gt; FAZ has the story this morning: &lt;a href=&quot;http://faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub={B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88}&amp;amp;doc={75F0D98B-CB94-4A2F-9152-F524DC646757}&quot;&gt;Auditors Say Federal Labor Office Falsified Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christopher cracks the Barney code&lt;/b&gt; He's had this Barney laptop since his first birthday, with buttons for numbers, shapes and various objects. After leaving it alone for a while, a couple weeks ago he picked it up again and kept switching to the 'find' mode, where he is supposed to push the button that Barney asks him to and is really intended for kids much older than two. He'd push a random button, Barney would ask him to try again, and Christopher would get frustrated and get one of us to find the right button. I had to play Barney for over an hour one evening last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last night, it clicked. Maybe Christopher figured out that he had to actually listen to what Barney was asking him, but he started finding the buttons, first time, every time. In English, which his not his first language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully expect in a couple of years that Christopher will teach me how to program in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now Christopher is standing on his chair by the sink, &quot;washing dishes&quot;. Can he cause any damage, other than getting himself wet? Well, if he has a paper towel in the sink that blocks the valve at the top of the sink, plenty. Notice how full the sink is. (The apple he's eating is one he's has personally washed in his sink.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the little crises that make life interesting. This morning Christopher woke up with his door closed. That shouldn't be a problem, but he crawled out of bed by himself (the two removable poles were out but last I remember they were in... did he take them out himself?), he stumbled in the dark over assorted toys to the door, and couldn't get out. And started crying. And I couldn't hear him from my bed, because his door was closed. I have no idea how long he waited to be let out, but it took 15 minutes to calm him down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I did not watch the Super Bowl last night, which was actually this morning German time. Midnight to 4am is not prime time for anything except sleeping. Unless the Vikings were playing. But even then I'd go to bed if they were being blown out at halftime.&lt;/p&gt;

The opposition isn't opposed to the additional planes, they just want to embarass the government by reopening the budget. But involving the Constitutional Court?&lt;br /&gt;
In the US, the government gets shut down all the time due to budget squabbles, and the Supreme Court never steps in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?x31207647&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt; The government has delayed the legal commitment for the additional planes until next year, and the oppostion has withdrawn their suit. In other words, both sides have declared victory and gone home.&lt;/p&gt;

A wind generator was blown to the ground up near Husum. The wind has been quite loud here the past few nights. I thought our satellite dish would blow away for sure.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad day yesterday. We had been out vistiting on Sunday, Christopher skipped his nap and at 6:30pm fell asleep in the car on the way home. We let him sleep, thinking he'd be up a bit earlier than usual in the morning. A 'bit' was good... at 4:30am he was already up and at 'em. I didn't recover from that until well after noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You didn't hear it from me, but if you look at your nearest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt; mirror, you might find the &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/4.5-RELEASE/&quot;&gt;upcoming 4.5 release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Experimental Failure</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jim.roepcke.com/&quot;&gt;Jim and Cheryl Roepke&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jim.roepcke.com/2002/01/24&quot;&gt;birth of their son&lt;/a&gt; (with picture!). At just over 10 pounds, he's in Christopher's weight class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night we tried removing the two removable rods from the side of Christopher's crib, since he can crawl over anyway. He found the new exit fascinating and refused to go to sleep, even after his parents wanted to. Finally at 10:30 pm, we put the rods back in. He crawled out one more time, and finally fell asleep. &lt;b&gt;Postscript:&lt;/b&gt; As I was writing this, I head a crash and cry from upstairs. Christopher is up and raring to go at 6:30 am! He's sure going to nap well this afternoon. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/xmlCoffeeMug&quot;&gt;XML Coffee Mug&lt;/a&gt; won't work for people running Radio remotely. Then again, people smart enough to run Radio remotely are smart enough to set up a redirect from 127.0.0.1:5335 to whereever their Radio is running.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Christopher's First Interview</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/01/24/christophers-first-interview</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today Christopher had an entry interview for Kindergarten. Unlike in the States, where Kindergarten is a year of half-day school before first grade, here it's a kind of state-sponsored day care available starting at age 3. In theory, every child is guaranteed a half-day place in Kindergarten. In practice, you have to apply for a spot early, and you may not get the location or the time slot you want. The cost and quality can vary widely from locality to locality. In Jesteburg the cost is based on income, so as double-earners we're at the high end of the scale. There are full-day groups available, with 25 children per caretaker. The cost is nearly as high as our current private day care, where there are never more than 10 children, and usually no more than 6. I think that Christopher can wait until he is at least 4 until he starts Kindergarten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a theory about Christopher's babbling. He's noticed that Mama and Papa each have their own language, so he has decided that he needs his own language too. I deciphered one of his words today: 'daddle' means pacifier. When he says it, it usually means he's looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;

I've set today's title to test out that bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama decided to take a nap this afternoon, but Christopher did not. It took me 90 minutes to convince him otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new motherboard didn't into my case, so I traded with Mama. Now she says her PC is too loud. She's right. I'll have to fix that for her.&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile XP is being installed on a empty drive, and the old FreeBSD drive is now in the Linux machine and runs under VMWare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher is causing an interesting glitch in our network. Our router is an old Pentium 200 running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fli4l.de&quot;&gt;fl14l&lt;/a&gt;, a isdn4linux implentation that fits on a floppy. I've moved my desk and shelves to the basement, but the router has to stay upstairs since it is the peer for the wireless card in my notebook, and there is no wireless reception in the basement. But without my shelves, the router box is on a table within Christopher's reach. And he loves to pop the floppy out of the diskette drive. The router itself doesn't need the floppy disk anymore once it's running, but the DHCP server needs to write to the floppy. And Windows boxes tend to freak out if they can't find a DHCP server on startup (Linux boxes will just reuse the last settings). I just hope that Christopher doesn't try to hide the floppy once he pops it out.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>9/11: A Brick In A Bedsheet</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/01/17/911-a-brick-in-a-bedsheet/"/>
   <updated>2002-01-17T03:01:26+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/01/17/911-a-brick-in-a-bedsheet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Visiting the States last month, it was quickly apparent that the effect of 9/11 on ordinary people was much deeper than I had imagined. In Germany life had indeed stopped for a time, but in the meantime had started again. In the States life hadn't yet really started. The feeling seemed to be fanned by the media, not only the news shows in series of artificial anniversaries (3 months since 9/11, 100 days since 9/11), but even talk shows, where the main topic seemed to be always dealing with the mental (or the economic) aftermath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A friend of mine gave a good analogy, although she was talking about the death of her father. The traumatic event was like a black hole in her memory, which she visualized like a brick in a bedsheet. In her memory, time was sucked into the funnel created by that brick, so that events that happened just before the traumatic event seemed decades away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, 9/11 did not change my world. Maybe it's because international politics was my minor in college, or maybe it's because I'm realistic, cynical, or maybe just sick. But after the shock and horror was gone, my view of the world had not changed. Such an event was possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's because my adopted country has had its own bout of terrorism, and security is more a way of life. The Schleyer kidnapping and the 'hot autumn' of 1977 was certainly a traumatic point in (West) Germany, but it was terrorism from inside, and the shock to the German establishment was that it no longer knew or even recognized its own children. It wasn't so much the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's because Germany has had much experience with sudden sweeping change the past century. Losing two wars, mass destruction and occupation, totalitarianism, division, democratization, reunification. During the Cold War, it was matter-of-factly assumed that World War III would begin in Germany. For some Germans, the Euro is now the 6th currency in their lifetime (6 if you count black market cigarettes just after the war). The US experienced nothing like any of that. Pearl Harbor, perhaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it's because Islam is massively present in Germany. Muslims make up nearly 10% of the population. For my first job in Germany, I went back to what I had done in college. I was ashift manager for McDonald's. I worked with staffs that were overwhelmingly Muslim (Turkish and Iranian), and I became somewhat acquainted with Islam on a everyday level. I'm no expert, but I do know what Ramadan is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two blocks from the Hamburg Hauptbahnhof is a street that looks like Little Istanbul. There is the very mosque where the perpetrators of 9/11 first spawned their plan. I have wondered, if they wanted to attack the West, why didn't they strike in Hamburg, where they already were? They were already in a rich developed nation. Why did they take the time and trouble to go to the US? Maybe they already knew what I just realized: that the United States was much more vulnerable, and that the impact of an attack there would be much deeper. Like a black hole in time, like a brick in a bedsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've put Radio back on the shelf, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiredfool.com/2002/01/16&quot;&gt;Eric Soroos&lt;/a&gt; explains how to get upstreaming to work with rsync/ssh, or indeed any command line tool (by enabling a backup, then writing a upstream callback that calls the tool). That's a lot simpler than I thought it would be. While he imagines the solution for OS X, I'm sure you could get it to work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cygwin.com/&quot;&gt;cygwin&lt;/a&gt; under Windows as well. But I don't have the time to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems to fit in better at the other site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received the following mail from Switzerland:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hi Scott&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for Katja. Could you please tell her to make a phone call to me ore to our mother (We don't have a new adress). Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;
I wish you all the best for the new year.&lt;br /&gt;
Claudia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Except that we don't know a Katja, or a Claudia in Switzerland. At least we don't think we do. She might be a spammer trying to confirm my address. If you're reading this, Claudia, and we do truly know you, and you are not a spammer, could you please remind us of who you are? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning the radio traffic report announced that a section of the Autobahn 7 south of Hamburg would be closed for 30 minutes. Yet another unexploded bomb from the Second World War had been found and was to be defused. Such announcements occur every month or so. But this time I couldn't help but think that if a rich developed country like Germany was still finding remnants of its last war after over 50 years, how long will it take Angola, Bosnia or Afghanistan? Or Ground Zero in Manhatten?&lt;br /&gt;
I then realized that I would be safe in my office during the closure, and drove on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German bureaucracy moves slowly, which can be advantageous at times. We were deliberately slow sending in our 2000 tax return to the local Finanzamt, knowing we'd owe a medium size chunk. We finally got the statement just before we left on vacation in December, as well as a request for some additional paperwork. We &quot;forgot&quot;, and today got a polite reminder. But they still haven't booked anything from our bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2002-01-12T08:01:04+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/01/12/leftover-lutefisk</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try posting items about Germany at my Movable Type site http://www.papascott.de, but I'll link to some of them here. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/&quot;&gt;papascott.de&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/2002/01/12/index.php#000101&quot;&gt;Who is Edmund Stoiber?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in December, I mentioned that we would be &amp;lt;a /2001/12/22&amp;gt;eating lutefisk for our Hanson Christmas dinner. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hal.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Hal&lt;/a&gt; remembered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hal.editthispage.com/2001/12/22&quot;&gt;childhood lutefisk dinner&lt;/a&gt; with his Swedish relatives, and I made the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/2001/12/23&quot;&gt;intelligent comment&lt;/a&gt; &quot;I thought Swedes had more sense than to eat lutefisk&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Day I missed a posting in my discussion group, since I was too busy &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;recovering from the lutefisk dinner&lt;/span&gt; being sick and partaking of that American Christmas tradition of watching the John Wayne marathon on WTBS. Namely, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonasbeckman.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Jonas&lt;/a&gt; (from Stockholm) &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$811?mode=day&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;Unfortunately, Swedes don't have more sense than that. Thanks for thinking we should, though. We call it lutfisk - and in fact I often eat it during Christmas. But I do stay clear of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.svensson.com/norge/sur1.htm&quot;&gt;surstr√∂mming&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; (Warning: follow this link at your own risk! Ed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also read a newspaper article from Seattle (but I no longer have the link) about a restaurant that would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be serving lutefisk this year (which was certainly a disappointment to certain residents of the Ballard neighborood). It mentioned the Norsefest in Madison, MN, and wondered if the lutefisk eating contest and the outhouse race there had something to do with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutefisk was, however, still available at certain &lt;a href=&quot;http://iowa.weblogger.com/2001/12/30&quot;&gt;fine shops in Iowa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
Everyone else may be working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com&quot;&gt;Radio&lt;/a&gt; today, but today was my day for laying cable. Twisted pair ethernet cable, that is... from our home office, through the wall to Christopher's room, down a PVC pipe in the wall two stories to the basement. I even crimped on the ends myself, and added a second hub. All I can say is... it worked, first try. I'm posting from the basement right now. And now I know the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escape.ca/~droopy/ethernetcables.html&quot;&gt;pin outs&lt;/a&gt; of the 8 wires in a twisted pair cable: white-orange, orange, white-green, blue, white-blue, green, white-brown, brown. Not bad for a guy who's color blind!&lt;/p&gt;

So it's Stoiber after all. A safer but less interesting choice than Merkel, but in my opinion the easier opponent for Schr√∂der, especially since the economy seems to be bottoming out right now and the election is not until September.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Notes Sucks</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been considering weblog server software (much like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nothingbutthetruth.de/stories.php?story=02/01/11/4320090&quot;&gt;WorldWideKlein&lt;/a&gt; as well today). I've considered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sunlog.ch/&quot;&gt;sunlog&lt;/a&gt; (in German, but that would be no problem), but right now I've been playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movabletype.org&quot;&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt; over at http://www.papascott.de. So far I really like it. It might be a keeper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lotus Notes ruined my morning. Let's just say that there is some sort of undocumented limit to the length of all aliases for a view, and when that limit is exceeded and the alias is called via http, the server responds gracefully by crashing. Took me about 10 crashes to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add to the misery, I had a backup of the database restored to my home directory, which somehow changed the ownership of my home directory to that of the Notes database, which made it impossible for me to mount my home directory, which made it impossible for me to ssh to my servers. No, it was not a good morning at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher's favorite toy at the moment seems not to be a toy, but a CD player. He got a set of kids CDs from his Uncle Steve and family, and we 've left a portable player within reach in his room. He gets a kick out of turning it on and off and pushing the skip button to start a new song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2002/01/08&quot;&gt;Alwin&lt;/a&gt; will be happy to know that yesterday, along with his U7, Christopher got caught up with his vaccinations. Next shot is planned for 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To repeat what &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmf.editthispage.com/2002/01/07&quot;&gt;Wes&lt;/a&gt; says, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/imac/&quot;&gt;the new iMac&lt;/a&gt; looks nice. But can I get one without a monitor? I'd love to try out OS X, but not for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/germanstore/&quot;&gt;&amp;euro;2000&lt;/a&gt;. I was thinking of putting together a secondary PC f√ºr multimedia anyway, but my budget for that is closer to &amp;euro;300, since I already have some of the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to grandparents: The two missing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.littletikes.com/toyfinder/productsfull.asp?sku=0813&quot;&gt;bus people&lt;/a&gt; have been found.

&lt;p&gt;Christopher the artist... and, yes, that's ink all over his legs. He was at the doctor today for his U7 exam, and one of the doctor's questions was whether he can scribble on paper yet. His vital statistics: wieght 14.2 kg, height 88 cm, head circumference 48 cm. He's a bit heavy for his height (but still within the normal curve), and everything else is normal as well except speech development, which is slightly behind, but to be expected in a bilingual family. In case you are wondering, here are examples of Christopher's art  &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$829&quot;&gt;on paper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$827&quot;&gt;on his own skin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first test in the basement found that there is absolutely no 802.11b  reception from my router upstairs. That's none, zero, zilch, not even at 1 Mbs. I guess it's because of all the steel and concrete on the ground floor (this is German construction, after all, no wood at all). Reception in the dining room, on the other hand, is excellent. So I'll probably have to run a wire after all. We have a tube running from the basement upstairs for such things, but it enters not our office, but Christopher's room.&lt;/p&gt;

Otherwise &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;Mama will have to do without,&lt;/span&gt; er, I mean I'll have to run a cable to connect the rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, first step is to move 4 bookshelves with about 20 m of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ora.com&quot;&gt;animal books&lt;/a&gt; (and a few others) down 2 flights of stairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Euro front, my last DM coins are now gone, and my last outdated currency is a single 50 DM note. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub=&amp;#123;B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88&amp;#125;&amp;amp;doc=&amp;#123;0A8FA8E3-017E-4C42-8ED3-84D9DC903CC0&amp;#125;&quot;&gt;German banks are packed&lt;/a&gt;, much more than expected, full with people willing to wait hours to change all the cash in their wallet at once and be done with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought on New Years Day that we were over jet lag, but yesterday both Christopher and I were very out of sorts for our first day of work/day care. Today is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/&quot;&gt;blogtracker&lt;/a&gt; missing a lot of updated sites lately?

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Somewhat unvoluntarily, I had a chance to informally compare health care costs in the US and Germany. A couple of visits ago, my mother got sick here and we took her to our doctor. Cost of the office visit was $20, plus about $3 for a blood test, and the bill wasn't sent out for several weeks. Last Saturday, I got sick in Minnesota and had to visit my mother's doctor. Office visit was $60, plus $35 for a throat culture. I had to pay cash on the spot, even though the bill won't be ready for my insurance for several weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got a prescription for 10 days of antibiotics, at $10 per day. That would be comparable to here, although my doctor here would never prescribe more than 5 days of antibiotics at a time. &lt;b&gt;Later&lt;/b&gt; all strep tests were negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After buying coffee this morning and milk this afternoon, I have just one 50 DM note and 8 DM in change left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher and I just did what everyone is doing today. We went to the bank to pick up some Euros. At 11:30, most banks were open, and business was steady at the teller machine. We withdrew 150 Euros, then bought gas for 20 Euros cash. I paid with 100 DM. The cashier said that he was trying to avoid giving out Euro notes, so he first gave me 60 DM in bills, took 40 DM as payment, then gave me 45 Cents in change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've gathered our remaining copper Pfennig coins (10 Pf and smaller) to give to charity. I still have 100 DM in notes and silver coins in my billfold. After that, the Deutschmark is history, at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meanwhile, Mama reports&lt;/b&gt; from work that E-Day is going so smoothly for her employer that she will be coming home early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sold my soul last week und updated my Windows 98 partition to XP, mainly so I could process digital video without having to break my brain. My first impression is good. My primary OS for the past 7 years has been Linux (since kernel 0.99something), and will continue to be, but I don't have to be ashamed to boot up XP once in a while (or use in in a controlled space like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vmware.com&quot;&gt;VMWare&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Last day of work, have about a week's worth of stuff to finish up, company Christmas party in evening.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fly to Munich for Mama's national company Christmas party in evening (hopefully &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; traditional Bavarian music) &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fly back from Munich, last chance to shop
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pack, stores closed
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fly to Minnesota (HAM-AMS-MSP)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collapse into coma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I'm ready for the coma part already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ack! Today on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bildarchiv-hamburg.de/hamburg/strassen/millerntor/index2.htm&quot;&gt;billboard across from my office&lt;/a&gt; (pictures 3 and 4) they put up a giant 50 foot &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ipod/&quot;&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to show Christopher eating in continental fashion with fork and knife, but by the time we got the camera out, he was eating in pirate fashion with just a knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you following Christopher's progress on the troublemaking department, you may recall that a few weeks ago he was able to &lt;a href=&quot;/2001/09/03&quot;&gt;flush the toilet by himself&lt;/a&gt;. Now he's much more sophisticated. He's able to go into the bathroom, pull out two rolls of fresh toilet paper, tear off several meters from each, open the toilet, stuff the torn-off paper into the toilet, and flush. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/11/25&quot;&gt;&quot;Puhhhh-tahhhh&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, as Dave would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Frontier programmers exclaim &quot;Puhhhh-tahhhh&quot; when they get something to work, I guess a Perl programmer would exclaim &quot;She-bang!&quot;. (Perl programs usually begin with a line &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;, and first two characters, hash sign/excclamation point, are referred to as 'she' and 'bang'.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sobering work day today. A sysadmin knows in the back of her mind that the real threats to her network are internal, not external. But it's still a shock when that shadow in the back of her mind becomes real. I didn't choose this profession for the joy of spying on my co-workers. But my firm pays me, among other things, to protect its assets. But some parts of that job are no fun at all.&lt;/p&gt;

To do so, we're required to replace the NTBA on our ISDN line. The new one looks almost like the old one, so I thought I could just switch the wires for the line going upstairs. Except that the wires are in a different order, and I managed to confuse one pair. Good thing there are only a finite number of permutations to order 4 objects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still here. Mama's out of town until Saturday, so I have both early and late shifts with Christopher, and time is short. How do single parents manage day in and day out? And we're in the middle of a particularly despressing cold and rainy spell.&lt;/p&gt;

We don't pay and we don't have a decoder. So we'll sleep, rooting for the D-Backs in our dreams, and wake up at 6 am to see if they won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/33361.htm&quot;&gt;NY Post&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;'It's a best-of-one now,' Arizona Game 6 winner Randy Johnson said. Tino Martinez added, 'Winner takes all, losers go home.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaos in the house. The parquet floor is done, but the baseboards and some finishing won't be done until tomorrow. So we can't put stuff back on the shelves yet, our dishes and glassware is out on the counters, the house is not safe and we have to watch Christopher every minute. The floor looks great, though. Christopher's already tried to put a dent in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Curry's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.curry.com/discuss/msgReader$801#theBlogRollingMacro&quot;&gt;Blog Rolling macro&lt;/a&gt; is bound to become the &quot;Hello World&quot; app for weblogs.com.

&lt;p&gt;I don't have time to write up a description this evening, but here is my adaption of Adam Curry's blogrolling macro: &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$778&quot;&gt;Blogrolling with PHP alone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany had its own version of anthrax anxiety yesterday. I never would have mentioned it here except that a state health minister called one case 'confirmed', which turned out not to be the case at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.guardian.co.uk/harrypotter/story/0,10761,585560,00.html&quot;&gt;Harry Potter movie&lt;/a&gt; is not going to be as good as the book. The movie never is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been trying out the VMWare Workstation 3.0 &quot;near-release quality beta&quot; at work. It took some work to convert an existing image, but once it's going it's real nice and snappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a brand new quote I just made up: &quot;To switch to OS X you might have to mortgage your house, but to switch to Windows XP you have to sell your soul.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got our first look at the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euro.ecb.int/en/section.html&quot;&gt;euro currency&lt;/a&gt; last night, 6 weeks ahead of the general public. Mama had a euro training class at work, and received an envelope with 3 bills and 8 coins totalling 38.88. The coins are heavy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Robb asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://jrobb.userland.com/2001/10/31.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt; whether the US Postal Service is worth saving. Who owns the USPS these days anyway? I spent 10 minutes clicking around their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usps.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and left without a clue. For the German post, I had the &lt;a href=&quot;http://investorrelations.dpwn.de/index_en.html&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; within 3 clicks (that they are a publically traded corporation in which the German government holds a majority share).&lt;/p&gt;

Christopher inherited a mixed box full of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lego.com/legofinder/duplo.asp&quot;&gt;Duplos&lt;/a&gt; from his cousins, so he has several train cars (but no track), plus a couple of race cars, and some farm implements that he can hook together into a long train of sorts (with a race car in the front and a plow in the back). And aren't &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindstorms.lego.com&quot;&gt;Lego Mindstorms&lt;/a&gt; really for adults who still want to play with Legos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.curry.com/2001/10/31#rockOfAges&quot;&gt;Adam Curry links&lt;/a&gt; to me, and I &lt;a href=&quot;/2001/10/30&quot;&gt;got the name of the club wrong&lt;/a&gt;. But it's fixed now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We put a battery in Christopher's toy drill yesterday. Now it makes the noise it's supposed to make, although he can still put his own drill together with Legos and make his own sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher is starting to build cool things with Legos. Six months ago he was happy (and his parents proud) to be able to stack 6 or 8 pieces into a straight block, no corners sticking out. He's now stacking up (and knocking down) tall towers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam talks about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mtv.curry.com/stories/storyReader$15&quot;&gt;partying with Prince at Paisley Park&lt;/a&gt;. We were in Minneapolis at that time; the club he mentions is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.first-avenue.com&quot;&gt;1st Avenue&lt;/a&gt; (not 7th Avenue, as I originally wrote), where much of Purple Rain was filmed and of which Prince was rumored to be part owner. I never saw him there, though, but I did see the Ramones 3 times there.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/&quot;&gt;blogtracker&lt;/a&gt; now lets you search for blogs by name or URL, and even lets you set a time zone. Cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been inspired to overhaul my favorites list here. It's mostly for my own use, but everyone is free to click on the links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping Christopher up for an extra hour worked, but not as well as we had hoped. He slept one hour longer, but that hour was of course negated by the switch back to standard time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;weblogs.com seems to have stumbled over the time change... the 'when' attributes was showing negative numbers for new updates in the first hour after the switch. The problem disappeared after that &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally got confirmation from EWETel that we will be switching our phone line on 23 Nov. That's good, since our flatrate with T-Online expired two weeks ago. Until EWETel takes over, we're paying for our Internet by the minute, just like in the dark ages.&lt;/p&gt;

But can it really attract 12 million visitors a year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/&quot;&gt;blogtracker&lt;/a&gt; might be a good way to keep track of favorites with the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. It takes a long time select entries, though, since there are some 5000 to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher is still waking us up way too early. Today we forced him to stay awake until 9pm, so hopefully he will let us sleep in tomorrow morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's fascinated by electric drills, it seems. He was cheers us on whenever we have something to drill, and of course the big loud hammer drill is better than the little rechargeable Chinese drill. And he pretends to drill into the floor, complete with sound effect. So we got him a toy tool chest today, complete with battery-powered toy drill. So he doesn't have to make his own noise anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After being out two days with stomach flu, and a hectic Friday, we're back online. Then again, every day with Christopher is hectic, now isn't it? Especially when his back molars are pushing through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard yesterday on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndr4.de&quot;&gt;NDR4&lt;/a&gt;: there have been over 600 Anthrax hoaxes in Germany the past week. 10% of all postal mail has been delayed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday &lt;a href=&quot;http://hal.editthispage.com/2001/10/20&quot;&gt;could be the day&lt;/a&gt; for Hal and Audrey, quite a bit earlier than planned. But don't births usually &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; go as planned? Expect the unexpected!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We watched MSNBC on satellite for a bit this evening, just to get an idea of the tone of reporting in the US (which we can't get from CNN International because it is too, well, international). My main impression was this: is the American media really reduced to using &lt;i&gt;toy&lt;/i&gt; helicopters as props to report on Afghanistan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was boycotting news about &lt;b&gt;FC St. Pauli&lt;/b&gt; until there was something good to report. In the 10th match of the season, they finally got a win, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bundesliga.de/en/bundesliga/2001/10/01904/nachbericht.shtml?&quot;&gt;4-0 at home against Cottbus&lt;/a&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It could have been a nice pleasant Indian Summer Sunday, but after Christopher decided that 5:30 was a fine time to wake up, and spending 3 hours hanging a single curtain rod for Mama's mother, the day was pretty much shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two comments from German newscasts this evening seem to have some truth. ZDF: As the Americans have no concrete plans for what happens after the Taleban, the attacks on Afghanistan are nothing but shots in in the air. ARD (on the anthrax scare): Fear is the main weapon of terrorists. Right now in the United States, that weapon is being used very effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, almost as a footnote, the ARD newscast reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20011014/wl/croatia_dialysis_deaths_5.html&quot;&gt;23 dialysis deaths in Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, which, if I were a dialysis patient, would scare me a lot more than white powder in an envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same day our cat Helga left us, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blackholebrain.editthispage.com/2001/10/12&quot;&gt;wet frightened kitten&lt;/a&gt; showed up on the Donellan doorstep in Mississippi.  Today Sheila has &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/10/13&quot;&gt;kitten pictures&lt;/a&gt; of Papa, a grey and black tabby like Helga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were in the States, we gave our cats German names. Our two cats now are from the States and are named &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$92&quot;&gt;Mausi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$90&quot;&gt;Karl-Heinz&lt;/a&gt;, and we've also had Marlene and Steffi. Does that mean if we were to get a cat here in Germany, it would have to get an American name?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helga, the grey and black tabby cat from the Humane Society in  Minneapolis, who had accompanied us since 1985, died in her sleep this afternoon. She had had heart problems for the past year, and had become progressively weaker the past few weeks. Of our three cats, she was the &quot;party cat&quot;. She was the cat we'd see the most around the house, and whenever we had visitors, she always stayed with them. We will miss her.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More &quot;war&quot; vs &quot;Krieg&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2001/10/06&quot;&gt;Alwin&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I've had all the same problems a lot of folks have had. Obsessive, fearful thoughts about the aftermath of 9/11.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davosnewbies.com/discuss/msgReader$639#640&quot;&gt;John Robb&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;This is very scary stuff. The malls are empty in the US. People are staying home. Nobody is doing anything. IF everyone remains scared or depressed, we are in a world of hurt.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother has called me just two times since we came to Germany. The first was to tell me that he was getting married. The second was to tell me he was scared to death by 9/11 and what could happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's because I'm an expat far away, out of touch with what's going on at home, but I'm not scared to death. Worried, yes, but not scared. But if that's the mood back in the US, if 4 weeks after the attacks everyone is paralyzed with gloom and dread, then the terrorists have won. A couple of dozen guys with box cutters have accomplished what they wanted to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/2001/09/17&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the difference between &quot;war&quot; and &quot;Krieg&quot; was that wars take place far away. 9/11 changed that. It was an act of war that happened at home. But to stare paralzyed into the oncoming headlights is the wrong reaction. Whether the headlights are real or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Midday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another ISDN outage left us high and dry from Friday morning to Monday. So we were unable to read, or post, or work, or use the telephone over the weekend. The Telekom now claims to have found the problem and to have solved yet. We'll see. In retrospect, I can only recommend planning your outages so that they occur on weekdays during business hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doc (&lt;a href=&quot;http://doc.weblogs.com/2001/10/07#coxAtLunch&quot;&gt;at home&lt;/a&gt;) and John (&lt;a href=&quot;http://iowa.weblogger.com/2001/10/08&quot;&gt;at work&lt;/a&gt;) have been have connectivity problems as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday at work, I burned a CD with some 50000 XML data files for a project. The actual scripts I left in my home directory, intending to download them from home. Of course, no ISDN, no Internet, no connecting to work. I had 250 MB of files on the CD, but couldn't get to my 10 KB of scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More annoying than the Internet outage was the phone outage, since Mama and Christopher were away helping Oma Ruth move, and we needed to keep in touch to I could help unload the truck on this end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not particularly comforting this morning when reporting the outage to Deutsche Telekom to be connected to a call center in Bavaria. Gru√ü Gott! Ack, just last week I submitted the application to switch away from the big pink T to an alternative local telecom provider. The main reason being that T-Online no longer offers an ISDN flatrate, and cannot provide us with DSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;scott, your &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/2001/09/17&quot;&gt;&quot;krieg vs. war&quot;&lt;/a&gt; discussion is probably the key to the problems. when i think of war i think of what my grandmother and my parents told me. and this is from the perspective of a victim.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you're right, kris. We Americans remember that war somewhat differently. Studs Terkel wrote an oral history of World War II entitled &quot;The Good War&quot;, which I haven't read, but the title relects our thoughts quite well. It was a monumental task, but we got it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the word &quot;war&quot; quite often to mean a monumental task. The war on crime. The war on drugs. German doesn't seem to use &quot;Krieg&quot; in this way. Then there is the American phrase &quot;moral equivalent of war&quot;. There's no German equivalent, I don't think, no phrase for &quot;moral equivalent of the worst possible moral outcome&quot;. So when American speak of a new &quot;war&quot;, it could very well be misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is election day in Hamburg. Since Hamburg is not only a city but also a federal state, the election is of national interest. And interesting because there's a chance the Social Democrats could lose power for the first time in 44 years. But the result will not depend on the big parties (both Social and Christian Democrats are expected to lose ground), but on the small parties. How may points will the Greens lose, will the Free Democrats overcome the 5% hurdle, and will the new right-wing party led by the ex-'law-and-order' judge Schill really get 15%? The tragedy in the US is expected to play only a very minor role in the outcome. &lt;b&gt;Later: The first predictions&lt;/b&gt; show that the SPD/Green coaltion has indeed lost power. The FDP is in with 5.5%, and Schill has over 16%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave says he's getting &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/09/22#l17ea816879b7b82011f4b639de12e0e1&quot;&gt;Lots more email from Europe...pissing on the USA&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. He's not posting any quotes, so I don't know what opinions he means. But as an American in Europe, that is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the feeling I'm getting. In Germany, the major parties are fully supporting the US. That support, however,  is not unanimous and not unconditional. Germany is, after all, democracy. A democracy that, in large part, was a gift from the US. Many Germans feel that this is now the chance to pay the US back. Payback for CARE packages, the Marshall Plan, NATO, the Berlin Airlift, &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Gorbechev, tear down this wall!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

On the web side, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squid-cache.org&quot;&gt;squid proxy server&lt;/a&gt; can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ix.de/newsticker/data/ju-18.09.01-001/&quot;&gt;configured to keep it out&lt;/a&gt;. Nimda is a DoB (Denial of Bandwidth) attack, which in the end translates into DoM (Denial of Money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org/releases/4.4R/announce.html&quot;&gt;FreeBSD 4.4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-2.2.1.html&quot;&gt;KDE 2.2.1&lt;/a&gt; are out, in case the Nimdas aren't taking up all your bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama's flying to Munich and back today. We'll see if she runs into any new security procedures. &lt;b&gt;Later:&lt;/b&gt; She didn't report anything unusual, except that on the place she sat next to a nice American man with a German wife and a 6-month-old son named Christopher Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNN: &lt;a href=&quot;http://europe.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/18/inv.hamburg.suspects/index.html&quot;&gt;Hamburg cell reveals details&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the pictures and the name that one of the hijackers used while in Hamburg, we realize that it's possible we might have had (slight) contact with him a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server change! Not for this website, but for our personal domains, &lt;a href=&quot;http://photos.shcon.com&quot;&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; and mail. My old hoster is going out of business. If I may pat myself on the back, the main domain is already done and took less than an hour. The trick was that I had the DNS at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.easydns.com&quot;&gt;EasyDNS&lt;/a&gt;. Once I knew the new IP address, I just changed it on their web interface and it was active within 15 minutes. So no horror story of being unreachable for days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FWIW, my domains are now at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pair.com&quot;&gt;Pair&lt;/a&gt;, where I've done business before. FreeBSD, SSH access, and they got the site going within a couple hours of my online application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a milestone that only a parent could appreciate, Christopher barked like a dog for the first time today. He was answering his Barney computer, which makes various animal and machine noises when he pushes the picture buttons. &quot;Woof woof, dog, woof woof&quot;, says Barney. &quot;Woof woof&quot;, answers Christopher. &quot;Woof woof&quot;, chime in Mom and Dad in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://moorbek.weblogs.com/2001/09/15&quot;&gt;Moorbek&lt;/a&gt; asks whether the English word &quot;war&quot; is not an exact translation of the the German word &quot;Krieg&quot;, since the US seems to be speaking of &quot;war&quot; more lightly than a German would of &quot;Krieg&quot;. I guess a &quot;war&quot; takes place far away, while a &quot;Krieg&quot; destroys everything at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's interesting to compare US and German news coverage. An 'expert' on CNN said that US intelligence failed because they are underfunded. A German 'expert' said that US intelligence failed in spite of being  well funded, relying too much on technical rather than human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

The pictures we saw, pictures of innocent victims, of aggression and destruction,will remain in our minds forever. We grieve for all people who lost their lives. Our thoughts are with their families who lost their daughters, sons, mothers and fathers. All of them have our deepest sympathy. Many years ago a magnanimous United States of America helped the German nation to free itself of its darkest past. The President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, brought us hope when he said during a time of need:  Ich bin ein Berliner.  Today we say to the American people: &lt;b&gt;We stand by you!&lt;/b&gt;&quot; This message took up the entire back page of today's issue. Readers were asked to hang it as a poster in windows, shop windows and cars as a sign of grief and support for the US.  &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Day The Earth Stood Still</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At 3:00 pm (9:00 am Eastern), I went into my boss' office. He was reading the web page of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tagesschau.de&quot;&gt;Tagesschau&lt;/a&gt;, the ARD TV news broadcast. A plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. I tried to find information on the web, but all news sites, American, German and otherwise, were jammed. I finally saw a first picture at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.focus.de&quot;&gt;Focus&lt;/a&gt;, and the first posts at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;. We set up a TV room to show the news broadcasts. Mama called from her car. She had caught the tail end of a news report on the radio, and couldn't believe what she thought she had heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to leave work early, even though I had started late. Outside the rain was a deluge, the gutters were flooding, traffic was slow. &lt;a href=&quot;//www.ndr4.de&quot;&gt;NDR4&lt;/a&gt; radio was reporting what they could see on TV, what the correspondent in NY could see out the window, the towers were collapsing, debate in the Bundestag was cancelled, members of parliament were milling together with visitors in the lobby watching the news broadcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama was home, the television offered pictures but no new information. Christopher was hyperactive, totally beside himself, as if he were breathing the tension in the air. Our satellite dish is on the fritz, can't get CNN at all, have to rely on the main stations. Chancellor Schr√∂der spoke of 'unqualified solidarity' with the US, which made me feel reassured. Otherwise I just feel numb. I miss an eloqent President, who can express what I and the nation must feel, but cannot put into words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama shed some tears. Perhaps she had started to fathom what has happened. I haven't. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's a first time for everything. Christopher's at a substitute 'Tagesmutter' for 3 weeks, as Heide is on vacation. This afternoon, for the first time at day care, he didn't want to come home. He had to show off the tricycle (that he can't quite pedal yet) and the mini-slide (that he can climb and slide down by himself). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retraction: the hotel linked to yesterday isn't really that bad, it's merely ugly, inside and out. But it's the biggest hotel in Munich, so when Mama has to attend big events in Munich, she usually gets put there.(&lt;i&gt;Later&lt;/i&gt; Mama tells me that they've remodelled since I was there, so it's not even ugly on the inside anymore. Just from the outside.)&lt;/p&gt;

(via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stormwerks.com/linked/&quot;&gt;/usr/bin/girl&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/2001/08/24&quot;&gt;hopes&lt;/a&gt;, the Telekom sent us a rejection notice for DSL after all, even though it's supposedly available in Jesteburg. They don't say why, just that it's 'technically infeasible at this time'. I suspect that we're too far from the &quot;Central Office&quot;, so we're stuck with ISDN until something better comes along (the Telekom is supposedly testing lower bandwidth DSL that will work over longer distances). Our T-Online ISDN flatrate expires in October, but we can switch our ISDN line to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ewetel.de&quot;&gt;Ewetel&lt;/a&gt; and use their flatrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A program I use every day: &lt;a href=&quot;http://phpmyadmin.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;phpMyAdmin&lt;/a&gt; has been updated with many improvements. (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de&quot;&gt;SWR&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama just called to say that she's just checked into the worst hotel she's experienced in 8 years of professional travelling. I guess she had to tell me, since usually I'm along when she experiences &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telehotel.de/sheraton_muenchen/foto.htm&quot;&gt;bad hotels&lt;/a&gt;. I'll be discrete and not mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hildesheim.de/&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; she is staying tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/09/03/borders-are-a-pain</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher's tricks now include ringing the doorbell (repeatedly), flushing the toilet (repeatedly), smearing cat food on the door handles, dragging hair dryers and irons along the carpet, and singing loudly to himself. He is very amused if you sing back to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borders are a pain, even in this modern day and age. Last week I tried to buy plane tickets to Minneapolis for this winter. Now, given that most German travel agents have no idea where Minneapolis is, never mind which airlines fly there, it's quicker for me to find tickets online myself. I know that to get there with one stop, the only airline I can take is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nwa.com&quot;&gt;Northwest&lt;/a&gt; (otherwise known as the &quot;Aeroflot of the Midwest&quot;). And at the Northwest website, I can find the flight I want. But can I buy my ticket there? No, not from Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or what about sending money to and from the States? Credit cards are nice for buying things, and when we are in the States we can withdraw funds with our German ATM card. But what if my parents want to send money for Christopher, or what if Mama's brother Roland wants to sell something to an American on E-Bay? Wire transfers are expensive, and not always reliable (once when wiring money to Minnesota, it got hung up in St. Louis for 6 months). And sending currency through the mail? I don't think so. Well, now there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paypal.com&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, and they now take international customers, and will even send funds to a German bank account. But only if you have a credit card. Roland doesn't have one, so I guess he's out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

The list looks like enough for a dozen lifetimes to me. Funny things is, in a bi-national family we have &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; opportunity to see places than we would otherwise, since our resources we have for travelling (mainly time, but also money) are spent visiting family and relatives. My parents have seen more of Europe than I have, and Mama's brothers have seen more of the US than Mama has. So it goes. But at least I have one place on both &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2020hindsight.org/&quot;&gt;Susan&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ipanema.com/&quot;&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama checked in from Verona this evening (via hotel phone, so we kept it short). She was at a do-it-yourself pasta restaurant this afternoon. Do-it-yourself as in here's an egg, 100 g flour, and a rolling pin. Roll it yourself. I had to think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com&quot;&gt;Al&lt;/a&gt; as she was telling me this. So maybe now she'll know what to do with that pasta machine we've had sitting around for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.byte.com/documents/s=1115/byt20010824s0001/&quot;&gt;Byte article&lt;/a&gt; about the lack of dual boot machines, and the question that who really wants one anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2001/08/28&quot;&gt;Al&lt;/a&gt; responded that he likes dual booting MacOS 9 and OS X, and is looking forward to dual booting OS X.1 and Linux on his next machine. I'm just curious, Al, what do want in Linux that you don't have in OS X and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicsource.apple.com/projects/darwin/&quot;&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, its BSD heart and soul? Especially since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elisa.utopianet.net/~rlucia/devel/darwin_ports/&quot;&gt;FreeBSD Ports&lt;/a&gt; are being, er, ported to Darwin, it's going to have all the cool, fun stuff Linux has, plus the cool OS X desktop, without having to deal with an ugly Linux install.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're cat lovers, we've had our three cats for over 15 years, going back to when we lived in Minnesota. But we do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; love our cats between 4 and 7 am, when they are loud and obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helga, the middle cat, is sickly and that's sad, I know. But after years of being satisfied with dry food, she now insists on canned. Only certain types. Every 20 minutes. When I've just gotten up and am still somewhat groggy, I'm going to attend to people's needs first. Not Helga's. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl-Heinz is Mama's cat. He the youngest, a 20 lb fluffball with fluff for brains. Mornings he waits until the first sign that Mama will soon be conscious, then he pounces into bed. He only wants affection, and 20 lbs of affectionate fluff is hard to ignore (and, as a husband, hard to compete with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mausi is my cat. He's oldest, the smallest, and the smartest. He just wants to talk and follow me around. Even if I just want to use the bathroom at 4 am and go back to bed, he insists on waking up the entire house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, by 7 am, when the humans have to be up and on their way, the cats have already taken over the bedroom and settled down for their day-long nap. Disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Telekom is now claiming that DSL is available on our street. A couple weeks ago their datbase was still saying beginning of November. I'm not sure, though,  where the &quot;Central Office&quot; for our exchange is located... if it is in the middle of Jesteburg, we might be too far away. But I re-ordered the beginning of this week, and they haven't sent a rejection yet. Or I can be like Cringely and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20010823.html&quot;&gt;roll my own DSL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The top prizes went to the VW 3-Liter Lupo and the Audi A2 1.2 TDI 3L, which both achieve 2.9 liters per 100 km, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digest.net/bmw/archive/v5/msg00097.html&quot;&gt;converts&lt;/a&gt; to 81 miles per gallon. The average new car uses 7.3&amp;nbsp;l/100&amp;nbsp;km (32 mpg), but over 10 l (less than 24 mpg) in the city. If Germans drove pickups and SUVs as frequently as Americans, the numbers would be worse. (However, unlike in the US, pickups and SUVs here have to meet the same safety standards as passenger cars, so most US models aren't available.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While Mama hat the honor of going back to her office yesterday for her weekly Monday Madness, for Christopher and me today was the first day back. Mama's boss is in town, they're out of town tonight, so I have double duty. Of course, CRH (that's Christopher Ryan Hanson) had to be woken up at 7:00, and I'm guessing he had a very &quot;loud&quot; nap at day care, since he got tired real fast this evening. He didn't want me to leave this morning, and was very happy to see me this afternoon, but Heide assured me that he was fine all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're starting to recognize a few words among his babbling. He says &quot;all done&quot; when he's done eating and has pushed away his plate, and her called his Oma Ruth &quot;Um-ma&quot; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.papascott.de isn't completely configured yet, but I'm already starting to post things there that aren't really family related. I'm going to try to post at least one German news story per day that I find interesting. I've already mentioned the upcoming NATO mission to Macedonia and the discussion on workfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher decided to serve his own breakfast this morning. Br√∂tchen with strawberry jelly, but please hold the Br√∂tchen. More pictures from yesterday and today are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shcon.com/index.php?album=08_2001%2F20010818&amp;amp;dispsize=512&amp;amp;start=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Next week Mama travels to Verona for a meeting with the exective board and a visit to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://194.149.233.39/English/&quot;&gt;opera&lt;/a&gt; on Friday night. (Spouses were also invited, but we felt that Christopher is too young yet to leave with a babysitter for 4 days, so the men are staying home.) But on Saturday afternoon, her brother and his wife are celebrating their 10th anniversary with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ms-stadt-kiel.de/&quot;&gt;chartered cruise&lt;/a&gt; in the Kiel Bay. And looking at the flight plans, there is no way to get from Verona to Kiel in time for the cruise. Not unless she charters a helicopter. I don't suppose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.curry.com/&quot;&gt;Adam Curry&lt;/a&gt; will loan us his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel plans: We'll be in Minnesota for 3 weeks in December to celebrate Christmas and Christopher's second birthday, returning before New Year's. Next spring, Mama has a meeting in Las Vegas the last week of April. Christopher and I will tag along, and the authorities in Vegas have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://hal.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$901&quot;&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt;. We'll probably also swing through the West Coast, so that Mama won't be able to complain anymore that I've never taken her to San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the doctor's magic eye drops, my vision isn't quite so cloudy today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've reserved some webspace under the domain papascott.de. I'm not quite sure what I'll do with it yet. I'm contemplating splitting PapaScott into two sites, one for family stuff and Christopher pictures, the other for tech/news/expatriate/politics/other kind of stuff that (I assume) are not of so much interest to the Christopher Ryan fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now at http://www.papascott.de I'm trying out an installation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postnuke.com&quot;&gt;Post Nuke&lt;/a&gt; (a variant of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phpnuke.com&quot;&gt;PHP Nuke&lt;/a&gt;), the PHP/SQL web system also used by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phillyfuture.org/&quot;&gt;Philly Future&lt;/a&gt;.

Not the stubborn 'I want my way' cry, or the familiar 'feed me now' cry. Even in the bath he cried. I don't what he was trying to say. Maybe he was just tired. I ended up putting him to bed early, skipping supper. I have no idea whether that was right or wrong. Right now, &lt;i&gt;I'm&lt;/i&gt; tired.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mama State</title>

   <updated>2001-07-30T04:07:23+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/07/30/mama-state</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's good to hear that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dangerousmeta.com&quot;&gt;Garret&lt;/a&gt; is healthy, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/01/20010727&quot;&gt;it was expensive for him to find out&lt;/a&gt; and now he needs to rethink his health insurance. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com&quot;&gt;Al&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/2001/07/27&quot;&gt;everyone should think about it&lt;/a&gt;. Here in Germany, of course, Mama State makes sure everyone has health insurance. The public system is financed similary to social security. Workers pay 13 to 14% of their pay (split between employer and employee) to a 'sickness fund' for their family. The system also covers pensioners, the unemployed and welfare recipients. Self-employed and workers with high incomes can opt out to private insurance, but some 90% of Germans are in the public system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public system is good for traditional one-earner families, but tough on double incomes. We both went private years ago, when we weren't planning on having a family. Children are covered automatically in the public system, but cost extra with private insurance. We also had to pay the full share of Mama's insurance during her maternity leave (the employer normally covers half). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public system has seen a lot of cost-cutting measures in the years we've been here, with co-payments for prescriptions and dental work and cutbacks in what treatments are covered. The system is in need of reform, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago when my mother was visiting, she had a bad flu and we took her on a Friday evening to the local doctor who was on call. We had the bill sent to us, and she left us $100, which is what she thought a similar visit would cost at home. The actual bill was $20. (And we were so impressed with the doctor that he is now our family physician.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Very nice weather this weekend, the whole past week, in fact. Nearly 30&amp;deg;C, sunny, slight breeze. Unusual for northern Germany. We should really be outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking for something else at &lt;a href=&quot;http://freshmeat.net&quot;&gt;FreshMeat&lt;/a&gt;, I bumped into &lt;a href=&quot;http://billstclair.com/blogmax&quot;&gt;BlogMax&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;an Emacs package that aids in the creation of a weblog&quot;. It creates a Manila-like static site, and is by Bill St. Clair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://billstclair.com/blog&quot;&gt;End the War on Freedom&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://phpix2.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;PHPix&lt;/a&gt; seems to be working quite well for the pictures, even though it's running on a very underpowered box. I think we'll keep it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posted in our company intranet: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sz/kultur/bundesdance/start.html&quot;&gt;Bundesdance&lt;/a&gt; (Flash alert!) with Schr√∂der, Merkel and Stoiber. You can pick their music and dance moves. Knowledge of German language and politics helpful but not required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My look at OSX was fun. I didn't notice any signs of sluggishness, but I guess 256MB RAM at 733 MHz is enough to handle it. Alas, all we wanted the Mac for was Netscape 4.7x under OS9 to test a Java HBCI banking application. All we would have needed is an iMac for half the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, running &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;kill 1&lt;/a&gt; as root in the OSX terminal brings the GUI to a halt and throws you into a full screen text window. We thought that was cool!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Globalization begins at home</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/07/25/globalization-begins-at-home/"/>
   <updated>2001-07-25T02:07:49+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/07/25/globalization-begins-at-home</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came to work this morning to find a new Power Mac G4 waiting to be unpacked. Alas, I don't get to keep it, but I did get to set it up (being the only one here who's ever worked with Macs), and take a look at OSX for the first time. Being curious admins, the first thing we did was set up the root password and see what happened when we did a 'kill 1'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the evidence to the contrary from Genoa over the weekend, I still believe that democracy works and that diplomacy works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a student of economics, I know for a fact that globalization and free trade can bring benefits to all parties. I also know for a fact that real world distortions can quickly erode these benefits. The critics of globalization do have some good arguments with respect to debt relief and fair trade, and they need to be considered by world leaders. But while the fringe of a G8 conference is a good place to get attention, it is a bad place to be listened to and to be taken seriously. The G8 or the EU are not world governments, and decisions are not made at summits. Politics takes place at the national level, and issues of globalization needs to be brought up at this level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, agricultural subsidies, and the particularly crass case of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensecrets.org/pubs/cashingin_sugar/sugarindex.html&quot;&gt;US sugar industry&lt;/a&gt;. In a free market, the US would be importing most if not all of its sugar from developing countries. Instead, US sugar prices are held 50% higher than world market prices, and imports are blocked by quotas. The winners are corporations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/mother_jones/SO95/kaplan.html&quot;&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cato.org/dailys/10-02-97.html&quot;&gt;Daniels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/publications/GEBriefings/controlfreaks/adm1.html&quot;&gt;Midland&lt;/a&gt; (since it would make no economic sense for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bankrate.com/ndaq/news/investing/20001221c.asp&quot;&gt;ADM&lt;/a&gt; to produce corn syrup with low sugar prices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money and power go hand in hand, and even in a democracy, money and politics are inseparable. But money is not the only influence on politics. The supporters of fair trade and debt relief need to raise these issues in the national political arenas if any action is to be taken, and not in the midst of a (police-provoked) riot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sign of adulthood: I'm starting to worry more about the state of the world I'm giving to my son and less about the one I inherited from my parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom got caught out-of-town in a tornado warning yesterday. As the radio advised anyone in a car or trailer to seek shelter immediately, she pulled up to nearest house with lights on. The family took them down to their basement, and even invited her to stay for coffee after the storm had passed.&lt;/p&gt;

In western Germany just 5% of the mothers with pre-kindergarten children work full time, and just 16% of mothers of children in elementary school. And how many mothers are responsible for tens of millions of monthly revenue and several thousand employees? I personally found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,145177,00.html&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msco.org&quot;&gt;Sherrif Joe&lt;/a&gt; from Phoenix and his tent jails and chain gangs entertaining.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Speaking of fairs, my hometown &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mfcf.com/lacquiparle_county_fair.html&quot;&gt;county fair&lt;/a&gt; is held very late, in September after the state fair. My mother is organizing the church food stand, and is trying to fill all the (volunteer) shifts for the four days. She says that it's more difficult than the nursing schedules she used to prepare. I'm sure she'll accept volunteers from outside the congregation, if anyone is interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A German 'Jahrmarkt' is similar to the midway of a state or county fair, but without the agricultural show. There is, however, an agricultural trade fair held concurrently some yeary with the biggest Jahrmarkt of them all, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oktoberfest.de&quot;&gt;Oktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; in Munich. When we took my brother to Oktoberfest a few years ago, a Bavarian farmer in town for the ag fair tried to teach him how to do bird calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://iowa.weblogger.com/2001/07/16&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; points to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iowastatefair.org/&quot;&gt;Iowa State Fair spokespig&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mnstatefair.org/&quot;&gt;Minnesota State Fair&lt;/a&gt; puts on a more sophisticated air and does not have a spokespig, although I assume that the two fairs are pretty much the same. Minnesotans are snobs, especially when comparing Minnesota to Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, Minnesotans rarely stoop to comparing Minnesota to Iowa, or even to Chicago. Culturally, Minnesotans feel that only New York and Europe are worthy of comparison. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prairiehome.org/cast/garrison_keillor.shtml&quot;&gt;Garrison Keillor&lt;/a&gt; wanted to exile himself from Minnesota, he didn't move to Des Moines. He first moved to Denmark, but it wasn't far enough away, so he moved on to New York. But he eventually came back.&lt;/p&gt;

It's fun in that everyone takes the game pseudo-seriously... but that's not the point. We took Christopher along, thinking he would go to sleep after the first round and that we would not be distracted the rest of the evening. Nothing doing. He stayed awake until midnight, for all 3 rounds, and was in a surprisingly good mood that late, all things considered, but our scores suffered accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the disadvantages of an electric lawn mower is that you have to pay close attention to the power cord. Yesterday Mama didn't pay attention, and mowed right over the cord. Luckily the circuit breaker did break the circuit, and Mama didn't suffer anything more than embarassment (especially now that I've posted this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled a muscle or something in my back Thursday night, and I was pretty miserable yesterday. Luckily our neighbor Andrea is a physical therapist. Today I feel like I got beat up, which pretty much describes how Andrea treated my back. At least it's an improvement from yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another source of news from Germany in English is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatica.com/germany.asp&quot;&gt;Expatica&lt;/a&gt;. For example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatica.com/germanymain.asp?pad=190,205,&amp;amp;item_id=10966&quot;&gt;Wild housecats terrify students in Bamberg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to the point for us is a report on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expatica.com/germanymain.asp?pad=197,212,&amp;amp;item_id=10961&quot;&gt;German Hausfrauenkultur (Housewives' Culture)&lt;/a&gt;. German women are expected to stay home and care for their children until they are out of school. Luckily we can afford an alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm (mostly) back up and around, just in time for the work week. Sounds like I missed a good picnic yesterday. The big kids were all playing on a slide too big for Christopher, so he made his own slide on a little hill on the ground, sliding down face first. He came home dirty and exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting heat in perspective: Having lived in both Minnesota and Arizona, my personal feelings of hot and cold are somewhat extreme. I can't really use the word 'hot' to describe any weather in Germany. For example, today is a pleasant, sunny north German summer day, 22&amp;deg;C. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hal.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Hal&lt;/a&gt;, Sunday &lt;a href=&quot;http://hal.editthispage.com/2001/07/01&quot;&gt;evening&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas was nearly twice as warm: 43&amp;deg;C (109&amp;deg;F) at 9pm. But in the desert it's a dry heat.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to the usual &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.helly.de/produkte/kueche/sicherheitsriegel.htm&quot;&gt;cupboard latches&lt;/a&gt; we found a clever &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.helly.de/produkte/kueche/herdschutz.htm&quot;&gt;shield for the stove&lt;/a&gt; which covers the knobs when it's folded down.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Abendblatt: For DM 30 million, Hamburg SV has renamed its Volkspark stadium as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/contents/ha/news/sport/html/300601/01HSV301.HTM&quot;&gt;AOL-Arena&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding yesterday's &quot;damage report&quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; asks if &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$647&quot;&gt;if every day is like that&lt;/a&gt;. While my report was a &lt;i&gt;slight&lt;/i&gt; exagerration, I'd have to say yes. I even missed a couple of points, like Christopher emptying his wash basin onto himself. And I skipped the part where we spent 15 minutes together watching drops of water drip from the awning outside, catching the drops as they fell. And the part where, dressed in his rain jacket, he ran out to meet Mama when she came home. Or how the 3 of us together did his 'stomp and turn' dance just before he went to bed. All in all, yesterday wasn't a bad day at all for Christopher, just somewhat eventful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have been a good day for me too if I had slept well the night before, were not suffering from hay fever, and had not had a stressful day at work.&lt;br /&gt;
And had it not rained the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Damage report</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/28/damage-report/"/>
   <updated>2001-06-28T19:06:22+00:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;This is Christopher sitting (under the awning) outside in the rain this evening. It was raining this morning too. On our walk in the 10 steps between our front door and my car, I tripped over 4 giant, evil, ferocious black slugs. The kind that eat every living plant in their path. Gruesome creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher had much more energy than I did this afternoon. I was barely able to keep up with his path of destruction. Here is his damage report for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5:30pm, arrive at home, drop and shatter saucer of cat food onto tile floor
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Escape into hallway and descend staircase into basement without supervison
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty kitchen drawer (without childproof latch) with food processor onto floor
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty kitchen cabinet (without childproof latch) with household chemicals (note to parents, this one really needs a latch!)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty package of 500 mini plastic toothpicks onto floor
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empty bucket of dry cat food onto floor
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sent outside, sit in wet Bobby Car
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit quietly outside in patio chair, don't move when rain starts, get wet (but get cute picture taken, see above)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While in Papa's arms outside, grab Papa's glasses and throw onto lawn, Papa blind for 10 minutes
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once inside again, reach for knobs on stove and turn on emtpy burner
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry cat food is now interesting again, empty cat food dish onto floor, splash hands in water dish
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Papa tries to read mail on laptop, crawl onto Papa's lap, slap keyboard, kill mail client
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:45pm, Mama arrives home from work, control and responsibility transferred from Papa to Mama, fed and sent to bed
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>More downtime</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/27/more-downtime/"/>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/27/more-downtime</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0106/msg00011.html&quot;&gt;debian-devel-announce&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;If you install this package... login, su and other programs that ask for a password all fail.&quot; I feel like Bart Simpson. &quot;You mean I broke my system so badly that not even root can login without rebooting into single-user mode? Cool!&quot; &lt;i&gt;That's why they call the current distribution &quot;unstable&quot;!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair after my anti-Windows rant last night, the 3rd or 4th program I install under Linux is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citrix.com&quot;&gt;Citrix&lt;/a&gt; client to log into an NT Terminal Server. That's necessary for me to be able to use a Lotus Notes client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've now gone two weeks without using Netscape (except to check layouts), either at home or at work. It's all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.konqueror.org&quot;&gt;Konqueror&lt;/a&gt; now. Konqueror would be my favorite of the three, except for a bug that sometimes makes it send a GET instead of a POST. As a consequence, I'm unable to use it to flip my page.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Downtime</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/26/downtime</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the AirLancer cards working, I'm finally able to use &quot;Debian&quot; Linux on the ThinkPad. I can't do any real work under Windows. There's no perl included. There's no ssh included. And there's no emacs included. How can anybody get anything done? &lt;i&gt;What about &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2001/06/26.html&quot;&gt;Brent&lt;/a&gt; and his dream?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Husband runs into wife in brothel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(From the back page of the Abendblatt, which extends on the miscommunication theme from yesterday and is worth translating in full) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/contents/ha/news/allgemeines/html/260601/302606LO3.HTM&quot;&gt;Aachen&lt;/a&gt;: A 37-year-old Aachener will likely never forget his most recent brothel visit. To his surprise, he met his 30-year-old wife, who was working as an part-time prostitute. Since neither was aware of the other's &quot;little secret&quot;, the meeting resulted in a loud argument which could only be broken up by police. A police spokesman: &quot;the further fate of the pair is unknown.&quot; (ddp)    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ich bin kein Homerun-Hitter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(I'm no homerun hitter) The Twins are making international press. In the weekly US Sport section of today's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/&quot;&gt;Hamburger Abendblatt&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de/contents/ha/news/sport/html/260601/2726AUFM1.HTM&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of Christian Guzman's grand slam against Detroit over the weekend (with a quote from TK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Downtime&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tis the season to be changing URLs. The latest is Susan, moving from &quot;editthispage&quot; to http://www.2020hindsight.org. Looking at it from a selfish point of view, the more people who leave EditThisPage, the better the performance will be for those of us who stay. &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing URLs or having URLs go dead for days at a time... I can't afford anything like that at work. We sell &quot;e-integrated financial solutions and services&quot; (I guess that would be &quot;banking software&quot; in normalspeak), and any breakdown in reliability or security would reflect badly on the company. My web servers get pinged every five minutes... if a ping is missed, I get paged, and so does my boss. (The only times I've been paged is when I've been doing system maintenance and have forgotten to disable the ping.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I appreciate &quot;Userland&quot; hosting this domain at no cost, but UserLand does not do it out of the goodness of its heart. We help UserLand to load test and debug its software. How else could they get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=PapaScott&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; to bombard their servers? How else would UserLand know that having Google bombarding its servers can cause problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't demand 99.999% reliability from &quot;editthispage&quot; either (that's 5 minutes downtime per year) or even 99% (5000 minutes downtime, or nearly 4 days). And since I run web servers for a living, I don't need to prove to myself that I can. I do &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;PapaScott&lt;/a&gt; just for the fun of it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Miscommunication</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/25/miscommunication/"/>
   <updated>2001-06-25T18:06:16+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/25/miscommunication</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Miscommunication can take many forms. Take this weekend. Something is goofy with our ISDN connection. On the weekend, Mama diverts the calls from her mobile from work to our home phone. This weekend, several callers heard nothing but silence when they tried to call her (instead of a ring, or the answering machine, or a busy signal). The problem could be anywhere... the mobile provider, our ISDN provider, or in one of the three devices we have connected to ISDN (a PBX, a a/b converter, and a PC ISDN card). And Mama isn't particularly satisfied with hearing that I don't know where the problem lies. She just knows that she missed some important calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or take tomorrow. I knew Mama was staying in Munich Tuesday night, which means I've got to get Christopher ready Wednesday morning. But then just this evening she says that she has to catch an early flight tomorrow, meaning I have to get him ready tomorrow morning as well. She probably assumed that if I knew she was flying to Munich, that she would be leaving early. But I'm still not paricularly happy about being informed just the evening before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess in a perfect relationship both partners communicate eveything that needs to be communicated. In a relationship that is only good but not perfect, you have to accept that both partners are going to make mistakes. And that's as good as it's going to get.&lt;/p&gt;

Our neighbor &lt;a href=&quot;/2001/04/14&quot;&gt;Achim&lt;/a&gt; raises asparagus, selling directly at his farmplace. We can see the fields from our backyard. We met some of his Polishworkers at the Dorffest last weekend, and as I write this at 6:00am I can hear the tractor bringing them out to the fields. The season is nearly over; the Poles are going home after this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rained all day yesterday for Christopher and Oma Ruth. Christopher was in an excellent mood anyway, racking up many Grandma Brownie Points. She will be moving to nearby Buchholz this fall, they'll be able to see a lot of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I usually don't like giving out birthday greetings, because 1) I'm afraid of forgetting someone and making them feel left out and 2) I don't want to make anyone feel obligated to give me anything in return or to throw a party for themselves (&quot;Happy birthday, what did you bring for us to eat?)&quot;. But on the Internet, I just figured out that neither argument holds any water, since 1) people announce their own birthdays, so you can't really forget anyone and 2) you can't really spend anything on anyone, so there are no obligations. So anyway, it's a day late and a dollar short, but best wishes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/2001/06/18&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/06/18&quot;&gt;Sheila&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Hooray! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;Mozilla 0.9.1&lt;/a&gt; arrived via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.debian.org&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend, and it's now better than Netscape 4.77. I'm giving up Netscape for good, since now along with Mozilla we've got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com&quot;&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Konqueror.org&quot;&gt;Konqueror&lt;/a&gt;. Hey, on Linux every day is like Microsoft-Free Friday, and there is never a All-Microsoft Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netscape made my first attempt at a white calendar look like this, which I must admit is quite funky, but not really what I intended. (What does it look like on a Mac? I'm almost afraid to ask...)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Best wishes to Roland and Kirsten, Mama's brother and sister-in-law, who announced to the family today that they are expecting a 3rd child in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of stressed-out parents, I've uploaded a new layout that's only half finished. I've stolen the Tagesm√ºtter logo; it seems to fit us somehow. I still need to work out where to put the calendar and the favorite links. Putting text over the colored stripes is not a good option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher's word of the day is 'deng'. This apparently is an exclamation to be made when any object, including Christopher himself, falls to the floor with a thud. Deng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher got a haircut today. Too many people thought he was a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here he is at work on my Linux computer. I think he's trying tohack my root password.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's another entry for the 'differences between the US and Europe' file. McDonald's Germany co-publishes a monthly movie magazine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kinonews.de&quot;&gt;KinoNews&lt;/a&gt; that is distributed in the restaurants and is aimed at teenagers. This month they are advertising a contest for VIP-Tickets to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loveparade.de&quot;&gt;Love Parade&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin. The contest is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.durex.de/de/htm/durex_news.html&quot;&gt;sponsored by Durex&lt;/a&gt;, a brand of condoms. Would McDonald's USA hang posters advertising condoms to teenagers in their restaurants? I doubt it...&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This evening I finished up the content for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.bei.t-online.de&quot;&gt;day-care website&lt;/a&gt; I'm putting together for Christopher's &quot;Tagesutter&quot;. Instead of 4 or 5 pages it ended up being 9 pages. Those day-care people are doing a lot more than I thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying lasso loose domains and set up an SSL PKI account, my desk at work is awash with paperwork. I have to track down legal paperwork for UK corporations, wire transfers of US dollars to South Africa, and get my boss to vouch to Thawte that I am really me and that I really work for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George W probably thinks he's smart to show up at the EU summit in Sweden on Thursday. If he were really smart, he would have crashed the French-German pre-summit in Freiburg today, where Schr√∂der, Chirac and Jospin decided in advance what will be decided at the EU summit. (By the way, Mama is miffed that George W isn't visiting  Berlin on his first visit to Europe. Then again, Mama is miffed by just about everything that George W does or doesn't do.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're back. Christopher's first day at the beach. He fell face first into the North Sea and he loved it. For a couple without children it would have been a relaxed romantic weekend. As for us, well, Christopher was awake at 5am Sunday morning. Enough said. At least the weather was halfway decent, cool but mostly sunny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama, Director-Executive-Supermaus by day, Mama-Supermaus on early mornings, evenings and weekends, has her birthday today. She's celebrating in the way she celebrates every Monday, by being at the office at 7 am to prepare for a day full of weekly meetings. Happy birthday anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/06/11&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; is waiting for an e-mail from the afterworld. Hey, you think ISPs in this world are bad. Try to find a good connection in purgatory... all you can find there is AOL and MSN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, coverage in Germany of the McVeigh execution has been rather reserved. I was sure the German media would find good cause to revile Bush as the new Federal Executioner. However, the difference between a state and a federal case is perhaps too subtle for foreigners, and McVeigh is too much like a neo-Nazi for anyone an Germay to feel comfortable making any comment at all.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Static in Radio</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/08/static-in-radio/"/>
   <updated>2001-06-08T08:06:16+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/08/static-in-radio</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/min/&quot;&gt;Twins&lt;/a&gt; aren't for real after all. It looks like they are about to lose 3 out of 4 to Cleveland at home. Ouch. As for the Mariners, I hope they have a World Series on whatever planet they are playing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm putting together a website for the local daycare organization, just 5 or 6 static pages. I heard somewhere (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.derschockwellenreiter.de/&quot;&gt;Der Schockwellenreiter&lt;/a&gt; maybe?) that &quot;Radio Userland&quot; can do static websites just like &quot;Frontier&quot;, so I thought I would give it a try. It has been over 2 years since I had put together a website (or in fact had done anything) in Frontier. I had forgotten how much fun it is. I had to look up a few things in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/tutorial/&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, and I still have a couple of questions (like how do I get an graphic from my #images table in the background of a table cell in my #template), but within a couple of hours I had the site pretty much working as I wanted it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put the layout up at http://shanson.bei.t-online.de. I don't want to show what a hot designer I am (I'm not), but I do think it turned out well. Bright, colorful and childish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My complaint about Radio would be that it's such a Swiss Army Knife with so many different blades, the menus are confusing when I only want to use one of its functions. It is especially confusing since the menus do not match the Frontier menus mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/tutorial/&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; pointed to on the Radio &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/stories/storyReader$3378&quot;&gt;static sites tool page&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think someone with no contact with Frontier would be able to put up a static site. That's too bad, because that's a functionality that I think would be the most interesting to newbies, before they become interested in newsfeeds and weblogs and all the other blades on the knife.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Film at Eleven</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/04/film-at-eleven/"/>
   <updated>2001-06-04T15:06:24+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/04/film-at-eleven</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, Grandma and Grandpa, we haven't been very good about posting pictures the past couple of weeks. We've caught up now. At PhotoPoint we've filled up &lt;a href=&quot;http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&amp;amp;a=12820285&amp;amp;f=0&quot;&gt;May&lt;/a&gt; and took pictures today at an historic mill and of Christopher playing in the rain for &lt;a href=&quot;http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&amp;amp;a=13155765&amp;amp;f=0&quot;&gt;June&lt;/a&gt;. And just yesterday I figured out how to make a Video CD, and we'll be sending you one tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/06/crhbike.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;crhbike.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/2001/06/03.html&quot;&gt;J√∂rg`s&lt;/a&gt; tip that today was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.muehlen-dgm-ev.de/teilnehmer/start.htm&quot;&gt;German Mill Day&lt;/a&gt;, we biked down to the mill at Holm, about a 15 minute trip. It was our first bike trip with Christopher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/06/millworks.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;millworks.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera is on a slow flash setting, so the moving gears are blurred. Our batteries ran out before I could get a picture outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/06/crhmill.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;crhmill.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon it rained again. Christopher likes pushing things, and we finally got him something of his own to push, a doll buggy. That poor bear has to go a lot to keep up with Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/06/crhbuggy.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;crhbuggy.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we went out to our old favorite restaurant, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treibhaus-marxen.de&quot;&gt;Treibhaus&lt;/a&gt;. Christopher was rowdy and rambunctious, just as you'd expect after an 3-day weekend of rain. Good thing that the Treibhaus staff knows us and likes us.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Goodbye Mr. Anderson</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/03/goodbye-mr-anderson/"/>
   <updated>2001-06-03T10:06:09+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/06/03/goodbye-mr-anderson</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since getting our DVD player back, I've been re-watching various scenes of &quot;The Matrix&quot;. DVDs are nice for that. Especially on gloomy rainy Pentecost holiday weekends. They say the weather will clear up by Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've talked the things we saw in Amsterdam, but not yet about the people. In no particular order... (links and pictures to follow)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea and Andr&amp;eacute; are students in Bonn. We had arranged to meet ahead of time in Amsterdam and we were at the same hotel, and they let us tag along on a couple of walks through the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra works at Jamba and organized the dinner. She was a gracious hostess, even though Christopher fell in love with her shoes and fondled them for several minutes. She didn't seem to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kishore and Sushma are from India, but moved this April near Heidelberg. He works for the German company SAP, so they had some inkling of the culture they were moving to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan-Willem is from Utrecht, just 30 minutes from Amsterdam. He had some good ideas about using weblogs for international communication and for overcoming language barriers. He also bought the last round of drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave could be Christopher's honorary Jewish godfather. Dave founded the 'editthispage' service the same month that Christopher was born, and Christopher has become a kind of poster child for the community that evolved. Dave played a couple of time with Christopher, and told me as I left that with a kid like Christopher, I'll have to live with having him in the foreground and me in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It's All True</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/05/30/its-all-true/"/>
   <updated>2001-05-30T04:05:08+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/05/30/its-all-true</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Last Flight Home&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/goodnite.jpg&quot; height=&quot;220&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;goodnite.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to an overly long meeting in Munich, Mama missed the last flight back to Hamburg. She has to fly to Hannover and rent a car, and she could only say good night to Christopher on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Culinary highlights of Amsterdam&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/05/26&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;, we had to have herring Broodjes. They were good, and Christopher enjoyed his share, but we didn't think they much different from north German Fischbrotchen.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Sunday we three shared a large order of Poffertjes (mini pancakes) with strawberries and cream for lunch. We sat outside at a colorful stand.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/poffertjes1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;poffertjes1.jpg: &quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/poffertjes2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;poffertjes2.jpg: &quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, of course, the beer. Thankfully, the north German '7 minute Pils' never caught on in Holland, and your Heineken (short but fresh) is brought to you within seconds after it's ordered.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Nice Life</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/05/29/nice-life/"/>
   <updated>2001-05-29T12:05:28+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/05/29/nice-life</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amsterdam with a small child&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/a.gif&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;202&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;a.gif: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spicynoodles.com&quot;&gt;Andr&amp;eacute;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; making sure that Christopher doesn't escape from his stroller. (Actually, when I looked closer at the picture, I noticed that at that very moment they were not watching Christopher, but instead &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$609&quot;&gt;they were being beamed out&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatisthematrix.com/&quot;&gt;Matrix&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun to watch Christopher in the city. Amsterdam is a city of narrow, busy streets, and he seemed to be fascinated by all the movement so close to him. And he loved the boats on the canals. At every bridge, he had to watch any boats until they were out of sight. So we felt it our duty to take him on a canal cruise as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/canal.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;canal.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend with him was easier than I expected. I was afraid that he would have problems adjusting to the travel and new environment, but as it was, he adjusted better than either of his parents. We usually plan for Christopher to take about half of our free time on vacation, but I would say this weekend that he took only a third of our time, so we had more free time that I thought we would. But our hands were full enough that we didn't take very many pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/hotellobby2.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;hotellobby2.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we need to be able to regularly change diapers. We had no idea where we could find changing rooms, especially during the 3 hours while we were waiting to check into our room, so twice we ended up going to our car simply to change Christopher on the back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/hotellobby1.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;hotellobby1.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hotel room Christopher felt like a king. He had room to move around, played with the telephone, bounced on the king-sized bed, and was able to use the leather chair as a slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/hotelroom.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;hotelroom.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We made it back from Amsterdam, and we're still tired. Christopher slept 3 hours more than usual today, and he's not caught up with his sleep either. We're all kind of depressed today, the weather is rainy, and work is, well, work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll write up my notes under the story &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$600&quot;&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; until they are ready to post, so you can read them in progress (that way I have no pressure to get them done). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Van Gogh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/vangogh.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;vangogh.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's Mama and Christopher in line at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/&quot;&gt;Van Gogh Museum&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. Christopher can hardly wait for the dose of culture that he's about to be fed. His favorite painting was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/collection/catalog/vglpainting.asp?ARTID=1&amp;amp;LANGID=0&amp;amp;SEL=1&amp;amp;PERIOD=1&amp;amp;SORT=NaN&quot;&gt;The Potato Eaters&lt;/a&gt;, for obvious reasons (he likes anything to do with eating). Mama and I both liked &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/collection/catalog/vglpainting.asp?ARTID=86&amp;amp;LANGID=0&amp;amp;SEL=1&amp;amp;PERIOD=3&amp;amp;SORT=NaN&quot;&gt;The Langlois Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn't for sale. Not even as a print. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From  &lt;a href=&quot;http://booknotes.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;BookNotes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/05/24/jeffords.senate/index.html&quot;&gt;Jeffords leaves GOP, throwing Senate control to Democrats&lt;/a&gt;. Whether or not you agree with the outcome, you can't really say that such a shift in the balance of power is really democratic, now can you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fli4l.de&quot;&gt;fli4l&lt;/a&gt; (floppy isdn4linux) is a linux router-on-a-floppy system (website mostly in German). It requires just a 386, and includes drivers for isdn, dsl and ethernet, firewall and NAT functions, and a number of utilities for monitoring from linux or windows clients. And it fits on a floppy disk. I've been using a Debian machine as a router up til now, but this looks promising. I've found it by accident, but it was also mentioned in the latest c't (11/2001 p127). &lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Cool, it works! It took me 20 minutes to set up (but then again, I've set up ISDN routers before).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Late&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekend! Well, for most of us anyway. Mama is on tour tomorrow, so Christopher and I will take a 'Vatertag' tour together. But without schnaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 8 weeks in the shop for guarantee repairs, my DVD player is on it's way home, at least according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seditec.com:83/Scripts/forminput.exe?RMA=174292&quot;&gt;online RMA databank&lt;/a&gt;. Unless it's a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent, &lt;a href=&quot;http://editorial.inessential.com/discuss/msgReader1389?mode=day&quot;&gt;I'm a baby boomer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2001/05/21.html&quot;&gt;I like punk too&lt;/a&gt;. Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheila.inessential.com/2001/05/22&quot;&gt;Sheila&lt;/a&gt;, I would have been in a good mood this morning whether the Twins won or not. Four-day weekend starts tomorrow, and the weather should be good all four days! (But Seattle-Minnesota would be a cool playoff series this fall.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days you wake up at 5 am, the sun is shining, the air smells wonderful, the birds are chirping, Christopher is sleeping peacefully, and all seems well with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I was picking up good vibes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/scores/20010522/seamin.html&quot;&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Twins 12 Mariners 11.&lt;/i&gt; Only at the Metrodome is a 8-0 lead unsafe.&lt;br /&gt;
Here is the in-progress summary of the top of the 9th from Yahoo at 5:30 my time. The next pitch was a strike to end the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also tried eating dandilions for desert this evening. Should I be worried?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/sh4/gems/mausnews/bath.rm&quot;&gt;In the bath&lt;/a&gt;: a pitiful first attempt at uploading home video for the web (30 seconds for Real Player, 163 KB). It's going to take a while for me to learn digital video. Maybe I need a 'Dummies' book. &lt;b&gt;Later:&lt;/b&gt; It worked! Christopher's grandparents were able to view the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helping out family in Minnesota&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother writes (I've removed the names): &quot;Dad has been very busy this past week.  His sister-in-law's brother had a heart attack about a month ago so was unable to plant his crops.  He has about a 1000 acres.  Dad, two of his brothers along with a couple of neighbors and a son got going on Wed. and Thurs. and it sounded like they would finish up Friday. I think they meant all of it.  Then after a few weeks, the neighbor will spray for weeds and then they are set till harvest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And finally in soccer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg's inner-city team &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fcstpauli.de&quot;&gt;FC St. Pauli&lt;/a&gt; has promoted to the Bundesliga 1st league for the 4th in 12 years (which means they've been demoted to the 2nd league 3 times in that same time period).  I imagine that in a year or two they'll be back in the 2nd league, but it will be fun to have them in the big league for a while, if nothing else than to watch overpaid teams like Bayern Munich play in their dinky neighborhood stadium.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I won't use the word 'might' anymore. All three of us will drive down to Amsterdam next weekend. I can't remember the last pleasure trip we took. Before Mama's pregnancy, I'm sure, so it's been at least 2 years. (Except, of course, for our road trip to  &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.edtthispage.com/2000/10/21&quot;&gt;Odessa&lt;/a&gt; while in Minnesota last fall. But that wasn't an overnight.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was last in Amsterdam in 1985 on our honeymoon of sorts. We were poor students, and couldn't afford a hotel, only a boat hostel which turned out to be owned by some cult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August we'll go to Sylt, on the North Sea coast, for a week. Mama's employer owns an an apartment for employee use. Sylt has the reputation of being overrun by millionaire snobs in the summer, but the millionaires are pretty easy to avoid, if you're careful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We try to avoid 'potty talk' here at PapaScott, but now for the second day in a row, Christopher has come to me when his diaper was full, more or less asking to be changed. Maybe he's implying that I sometimes forget to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com/&quot;&gt;Alwin&lt;/a&gt; says: &quot;Those of you with children &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucomics.com/james/viewjm.cfm?uc_fn=1&amp;amp;uc_full_date=20010508&amp;amp;uc_daction=P&amp;amp;uc_comic=jm&quot;&gt;will understand this&lt;/a&gt;; the younger the better...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My folks arrived safe and sound in Minnesota. Flying back to the land of too-many-Hansons, KLM assigned them separate seats belonging to a different set of Hansons. My folks insisted on sitting together, but the only adjoining sets were in First Class. So they flew from Amsterdam to Minneapolis in First Class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful weather all this week, and it should last through the weekend. After day care I can just unpack Christopher and let him go in the back yard. Between the rose bushes and the new gate, he's not going anywhere, and for activities he can choose between the sand box, the Bobby Car, and playing in the dirt. (Like our elementry school janitor used to say, 'Get out of the doit before you get hoit!')&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My web server upgrade to FreeBSD 4.3 went off without a hitch. (Well, I'm not quite done. The test server is online, but I'll let it run a couple of days before I wipe out the file systems on the real server.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's really a Scripting News dinner two weeks from now in Amsterdam, I might go. It's a long holiday weekend, the weather should be nice, I haven't been to Amsterdam since our honeymoon in 1985, and it's just a 5 hour drive. I'll see if MamaMaus will give me the weekend off. Or maybe she'll come along.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a successful re-entry to day care and a hard afternoon on the lawn and in the sand box, by 8 pm Christopher was filthy. Mama filled his bathtub (which sits inside our bathtub), turned around for a second, and Christopher jumped in by himself, clothes and all. Of course he could have hurt himself quite seriously, but as it was he just got wet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed, the idyll on the patio last evening didn't last very long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we sent Grandma and Grandpa on their merry way back to Minnesota. Tomorrow, Mama returns (for a couple of days), Christopher goes back to day care, and I go back after two weeks to a refreshing day at the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having left my parents early and moved far away, our infrequent but long visits tend to leave me with mixed feelings (there is nothing like your parents to make you feel childish). But Christopher is now something additional that we have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what you know, my employer made a profit last quarter. A whole Euro 15000. I guess that's what our CEO meant when she was hoping for a 'black zero' for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After installing a replacement Firewire card, I was finally able to capture some video onto my PC. Now I just have to figure out what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,108494,00.html&quot;&gt;possible writer's strike&lt;/a&gt; in Hollywood reminded me of an article in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de&quot;&gt;Abendblatt&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago (for which I can find no link) describing how European television is becoming less American. Even though there are ever more commericial stations in Europe with more time to fill, it is cheaper for them to produce their own shows than to buy from the US. At least in Germany, there are no US series in prime time any more (although plenty of American movies)... a show like 'Friends' might be on after 11 pm or on Saturday afternoon. And to add insult to injury, even American television is becoming less American. Three of the top ten shows (Big Brother, Survivor, Millionaire) are imported concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sandbox season is now officially open. After some initial hesitation (what is this strange stuff on my toes?!?), Christopher spent nearly two hours on his first visit to his sandbox. We had to shake him out afterwards, and his nap schedule was totally ruined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/gate.jpg&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;gate.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile my father, who is much more handy than I, is working on various projects on our patio (I try to help, but end up mostly watching). He's put up a wall and gate between the patio and house as 'Christopher protection' (as much to protect the outside world from Christopher as vice versa), and we're now looking at the drainage from the patio itself. Well, right now it doesn't drain so much as seep, very slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/05/summit.jpg&quot; height=&quot;324&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;summit.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the annual grandparent summit in Eckernf√∂rde, a family event second to only Christmas on our calendar. I was sick as a dog, but dragged myself to dinner and coffee. I slept through the 2-hour walk along the beach. (As for the dog sickness, I'm pretty much over it, but my Mom has it today.)&lt;/p&gt;

Not just &quot;two steps to get from chair to chair because it's too much trouble to get down and crawl&quot;, this is &quot;get up by myself and take six steps just because I feel like it&quot;. And Grandma and Grandpa were here to see it. The world has just become a tiny bit more unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Grandma and Grandpa have been here a week. Mama's had a busy work week, so Christopher and I have done our best to entertain them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No pictures, because we've been playing with a new Canon MV300i video camera. I've knocked myself out trying to load video into the PC. I think the Firewire card is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

Luckily, it didn't stay cold the whole day. We went to visit Christopher's grandmother in Eckernf√∂rde, and while the weather wasn't particularly pleasant, it wasn't cold. Christopher was in a better mood than he looks like in the pictureand yes, he has a new haircut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Since today is a holiday we moved up Christopher's  weekly bathday. He didn't mind and splashed at his best.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dangerousmeta.com/&quot;&gt;Garret&lt;/a&gt;, my windows telnet client of choice is &lt;a href=&quot;http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA002416/teraterm.html&quot;&gt;TeraTerm Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It's clean, free, and has an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html&quot;&gt;SSH extension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:45 am on a holiday, and Christopher is already awake. I thought we wore him yesterday so we could sleep in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Dead.Com department, the Abendblatt had an article on Internet firms in Hamburg with big losses on the Neuer Markt. My employer made the top of the list, meaning the 92% decline in our stock since 03/2000 was the 2nd best of the 10 firms mentioned (i.e. the rest had bigger declines). And the past week our stock has actually doubled (from 2.20 to 4.90). My first set of options due next month are at 25.50, so we still have a ways to go.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yet another difference between Germany and the US. Germany sells high tech to China that it can't afford itself (Transrapid train for Shanghai). The US just drops high tech espionage aircraft at China's doorstep... at no charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another. Bush rejects the Kyoto accord and gets raspberries from home and abroad. Germany's Schr√∂der embraces Kyoto, yet according to ARD's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monitor.de&quot;&gt;Monitor&lt;/a&gt; German carbon dioxide emissions actually increased in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the home front, Christopher is once again very 'consistent', to the relief of both parents and day care.  (By the way, his new favorite toys are Happy Meal premiums Furby and Shelby that sing to one another. Hopefully the batteries will run out soon.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bovine PC. At work, I was given a PC named 'galloway' as a backup web server. It's now infected with BSE... I mean, installed with BSD. I then installed the ports, and now it's full of MK files (MK is the German abbreviation for Foot and Mouth). I hope that a disinfection will not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>In my world I take him out for tea</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;20&amp;deg;C (that's 68 for you Fahrenheits) and sunny. Spring is here. I took Christopher out in the carriage on the short walk, around the asparagus fields and through the 'Buttermoor'. At the half-way point, where you can clearly see our house and backyard across the fields, he started laughing out loud. Maybe he recognized that this is the view that he sees from his bedroom window. But probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally today, Christopher seems to be over his stomach bug. I know we have at least two interested medical professionals reading this (one of which is Christopher's grandmother... hi Mom!), so I'll go into detail. Yesterday he was not yet over it, so we took a trip to the pharmacist on call for the weekend. (There are no over-the-counter medications in Germany; you get all medicine, whether with prescription or without, even aspirin, from a pharmacist from behind the counter.)  The pharmacist told us that there must be an epidemic of stomach flu, since he was giving us his last stock of 'Diarrhoesan' (natural medicine with active ingredients apple pectin and camomile). It seemed to help. Christopher outright refused the electrolyte solution, though, but since he was drinking his fruit tea with apple juice, we weren't all that worried about dehydration. Today I tried to stick to the BART (banana-apple-rice-toast) diet. His appetite was not that good, and he took an extra nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow at work I'm supposed to give a workshop on HTML/CGI/JSP, an overview for our quality managers and technical editors. In German, of course. I don't have much experience (i.e. none) with Java servlets, but the rest I could recite in my sleep. We'll start with HTTP requests via telnet (browser? we don't need no stinking browser!).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>I can't let go of you now</title>

   <updated>2001-03-31T19:03:59+00:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A story not for the squeamish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We looked up 'diarrhea' in the Dictionary of Childhood Diseases that my mother-in-law gave us. The definition starts with the remark that everyone experiences it. Christopher is experiencing it now, it's the third day and we're starting to worry. It's strange because as it started, he had fever and was noticably sick and inactive. But his appetite and behavior were almost normal yesterday, and this morning he looked and acted normal. But he refused lunch, the diarrhea returned in the afternoon, and although he ate well after his nap, he refused supper. But he has no fever, and he's drinking well. We are thoroughly confused. We'd take him to his doctor if it were a weekday, but as it's the weekend we'll let him sleep and see how he is in the morning, then decide if we head the the children's clinic in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with that background, at 5pm I heard the telltale signs of a new episode. Since we had already done two complete changes today, I thought that with quick action I could avoid a third complete change. I was too quick. He wasn't finished. As he lay undressed on the changing table, the first shot got me on the leg. I instinctively jumped aside, and the second shot landed a good meter from the  table. The third shot had a good arch and reached a meter and a half. I was frozen in shock, but Christopher amazingly felt no pain at all and found the situation quite hilarious. At this point Mama came into the room and wisely suggested that we quickly block the source. Good thing we have a full bottle of pet stain remover for the carpet. It works for children's stains too, and covers the odor as well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Europe went on Daylight Savings Time today, in case you're wondering what we're doing up so early. North America starts next weekend, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still awfully cold, though. Mid-30's and freezing rain. Yech!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering I was half sick yesterday, I got a lot done. (Mama was full sick,so she couldn't help.) I fixed the lock on our mailbox (after 6 months), so we again comply with German postal secrecy and require at least a good screwdriver to break in (which is how we broke the original lock). And I hung a curtain in Christopher's bedroom in preparation for longer daylight. After all, the longer he sleeps, the longer we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might have something to do with the Minnesota March weather we've been having. Yech!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher's lip is nearly back to normal. Two small white slits are all that can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proud to be German?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub=&amp;#123;B1311FCC-FBFB-11D2-B228-00105A9CAF88&amp;#125;&amp;amp;doc=&amp;#123;D9E673E0-1D33-11D5-A3B5-009027BA22E4&amp;#125;&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/a&gt; from the conservative FAZ (English Edition).  State elections (coming up this weekend) seem to bring out the worst in German politicians, whether it's a petition against dual-citizenship, a 'Kinder staat Inder' (children not Indians) campaign against the green card, or now a silly debate whether it's OK to say that one is proud to be German. It seems especially silly to me, being born in a country where patriotism is, well, as American as apple pie. It's fun listening to CDU politicians whine, though. Helmut Kohl never had such a thin skin. Kohl was never thin, period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ich mu√ü Harald Schmidt zustimmen: lieber stolz, ein Deutscher zu sein, als stolz, Laurenz Meyer zu sein!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Madman Situation</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/03/20/madman-situation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/03/office.jpg&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; width=&quot;325&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;office.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of quoting random songs in my page titles, I think I quote the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mandymoore4always.org/sugababes/overload.html&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; for a few days, at least until I get tired of it. Americans probably won't recognize it, since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk.bol.com/cec/cstage?ecaction=bolprditmview&amp;amp;PrdId=1000002001773781&quot;&gt;Sugababes&lt;/a&gt; haven't arrived there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My employer's semi-relaunch went off without a hitch last night. To roll out the new logo for CeBIT, we basically bolted the agency's new navigation onto the old content. In a couple weeks we'll get it done right. I'm no designer, but to my eye the site looks alright. There's an awful lot of JavaScript, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As new parents, you can find all sorts of timetables and milestones your child should be reaching, and you might even take some of them seriously. Christopher is now 15 months old, an age at which 90% of children can walk. He's in the other 10%. He's almost there, but other than a breathless half-step from the couch to the coffee table, he's not walking. He's big for his age, and his coordination needs to catch up to his size, so we're not at all worried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$537?mode=day&quot;&gt;Al gives&lt;/a&gt; a more informed explanation: &quot;Bigger kids need some major muscle strength in both their legs and abdomen to walk erect. Smaller kids have a lot less mass and shorter moment arm to hold erect.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then we read that a child can start learning to use a spoon at 8 months. Christopher's only relationship with a spoon so far is to open his mouth and wait. I thought we could give self-feeding a try this evening. He didn't do too badly, but I still have a shirt full of yoghurt to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;

So, here I am performing a major update of my employer's website from the comfort of my own home. I'd normally feel more comfortable doing this after midnight rather than at 9pm, but the current sleep schedule dictates otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the 4th web agency I've worked with, and the first that leaves a competent impression. They don't have a clue about security, though, but neither did the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Middle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It's snowing here, again. I thought I left Minnesota to avoid this kind of weather!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North of Hamburg they're having a real blizzard, with force 11 winds (they still use the Beaufort scale here... that's around 70 mph), with lots of closed roads and schools.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christopher has a fat lip. He slipped from the couch and landed with his lip on the corner of Mama's old doll house. There was some blood at first as two teeth cut into his lip, but he's eating and drinking just fine. He just looks like a battered boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2001/03/crhboxer.jpg&quot; height=&quot;244&quot; width=&quot;325&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;crhboxer.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Something is very wrong with my internal body clock I used to to think that 5 am was a time of day that existed only in limbo. Now, even though I can sleep until 5:45 on work days, I'm always awake before 5:00. Even on weekends, when I can sleep in.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Or dead com. Or dot zombie. I don't know which of these we are, but Mama now reminds me daily that she achieves our yearly worldwide sales every 3 weeks or so in northern Germany alone. Now she gets to make executive decisions like who gets the new office chairs, and what to do when when too many PCs are ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like a bad penny, CeBIT stress has reared it's ugly head again. Why take the time to do something right, when something, &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; has to be ready by March 22? But don't tell me about until a week beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At day care Christopher refuses to drink the fruit tea we send along, holding out for apple juice. But at home he drinks the fruit tea. I guess he's already practicng manipulation of adults.&lt;/p&gt;

When logged in remotely as root to your server, typing 'kill 1 120' when you mean 'kill -1 120' can really ruin your morning. (Rather than restarting process 120 with signal 1, I ended up killing process 1, the init process, effectively halting the computer.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Late&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4:30 Up too early, check mail, do some perl work, cereal for breakfast.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6:30 Christopher wakes up 30 minutes too early. Give him some apple juice, quickly shave and shower.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:00 Wash and dress Christopher, feed him his cereal, gather our bags and coats.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7:40 Take off.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8:00 Drop off Christopher with Heidi at day care. Big greeting from Artus, the German Shepherd.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9:15 Got stuck in traffic, arrive somewhat late
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16:10 Take off after handling a last minute mail.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17:15 Pick up Christopher, say goodbye to Heidi and Artus. His day was good... slept well, and (as always) ate well.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17:30 Arrive at home. Banana, Bobby Car, check mail, reconfigure an SSL Server, wrestle on the couch.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19:00 Supper for Christopher, black bread and cheese. One last round with the Bobby Car, then change, pyjamas, tea bottle, bed.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19:45 OK, where did I leave off this morning?
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Hall of Fame</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My folks sent an E-Mail from Florida via my cousin, who &quot;joined us on Friday just in time to go to the Twins game.  They lost,&lt;br /&gt;
but Kirby was there and was recognized for being in the Baseball Hall Of Fame.&quot; Whoa. We we no idea. We were preoccupied with Christopher in January, and the news didn't make the German Tagesschau. 17 Jan 2001, CNNSI: &lt;a href=&quot;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2001/01/17/hall_puckett_ap/&quot;&gt;Puckett gets highest honor in the game he loves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 80's we lived in South Minneapolis within biking distance of the Metrodome, and took in dozens of Twins games, usually behind Kirby in the center field bleachers. In the fall of 1987, two events for us both personally changed our lives forever. It was coincidence that Kirby and the Twins won the World Series that fall, and I've always associated the turning point in our lives with that World Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991, we were in Hamburg, there was no Internet for normal folks yet, and I followed the Series the best I could on CompuServe and the International Edition of USA Today. We flew to Spain for vacation the weekend of the final games, and I learned that the Twins won the 7th game via Voice of America on a shortwave transistor radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a silly thing, but ever since I started using Linux 7 years ago and had to give my PC a name, it's always been named 'kirby'. When deciding names for our son, I briefly considered Kirby. At least as a middle name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Christopher and I spent our day upgrading PCs. I picked up a 900 MHz Athlon for myself, Mama gets my old 500 MHz Athlon and more RAM, and a CD writer. She's become interested in music from Napster lately, and her company car has a CD player. So now she can burn her own music CDs.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've decided that Christopher is eating too much. It's not just that I've been calling him the 'bottomless pit' the past few weeks. A newborn baby needs to be fed whenever she's hungry, and it's very easy to soothe a crying spell with a cracker or a banana. Socially, Christopher always wants to eat along with the adults, even if he's just had his own meal. At 14 months it's time to start being a little more selective with feeding. So it's time that he eats his meals along with us, not before, and no more snacks to soothe every complaint. Today (a work day for Mama) was the first day of the new strategy. Christopher didn't like having to wait for us at breakfast this morning, but otherwise it was a smooth day for us men at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coming week will be another tough one. Mama has 3 days of meetings in Munich. At least this time I'm healthy, unlike the first 3 day stretch last month.&lt;/p&gt;

In the US, this would be a plea bargain and an admission of guilt. Here this seems to be a proclamation of innocence.&lt;/p&gt;

Mama's on the road tonight. On Wednesday we'll be able to explain how she'll be putting less miles on her tires and more miles on her frequent flyer card in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 'now I feel really old' department, my parents told me about a high school classmate of mine (she graduated a year later than I) who will be retiring this year. Yes, she was in the military.&lt;/p&gt;

But when I go through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anonymizer.com&quot;&gt;Anonymizer&lt;/a&gt;, a proxy service located in California, the ads are gone. FAZ is somehow checking where you come from. (&lt;b&gt;Correction&lt;/b&gt;: The ads do appear for Garret, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dangerousmeta.com/discuss/00000272?expand_all=1&quot;&gt;he just overlooked them&lt;/a&gt;.) The FAZ is too right-wing anyway. Is there any other major German newspaper with English translations online?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Midwesterners will recognize the term 'forenoon lunch'. It's a second breakfast, eaten out in the field if you're farming. Well, Christopher just had his... and it's just 9:00! (He later had a second 'forenoon lunch', and a normal dinner at noon.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Late&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If Iowa looks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://iowa.weblogger.com/discuss/msgReader$954&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, I dread even to imagine what Minnesota looks like...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Early&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Frankfurter Allgemeine: &lt;a href=&quot;http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?p15656731&quot;&gt;Court Allows Airbus to Expand Hamburg Facility&lt;/a&gt; This clears the way for final assembly of the 'Super Airbus' A380 in Hamburg and the creation of 4000 jobs. Aviation (mainly Airbus and Lufthansa) is already the biggest industry in Hamburg (in terms of numbers of jobs), and Hamburg (behind Seattle and Toulouse) is the 3rd largest aviation city in the world. However, the new assembly hall is set to be built on a mudflat that is a EU-protected wildlife refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I said we were 99% sure. Now we are 100% sure, and we know when it will happen. But we can't say what it is yet. This is the Internet, after all, and we don't know who all will be reading this. But next Wednesday, the 28th, we'll have a big announcement to make. And you heard it here first.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>With or Without You</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2001/02/19.html&quot;&gt;Brent&lt;/a&gt;, our cheer in Madison MN was better: &quot;Lutefisk and Lefse, Tus-ka-da-ha, we can beat &amp;lt;whoever&amp;gt;, ya ya ya!&quot; And Madison is of course the &lt;a href=&quot;http://personal.riverusers.com/~roses/lutefisk.htm&quot;&gt;Lutefisk Capital of the USA&lt;/a&gt;, and we have a fiberglass fish to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$501&quot;&gt;favorites script&lt;/a&gt; on my online host, a poor Pentium/133 with 32MB RAM, and it took nearly 2 minutes to complete. It really is brute force! I also realized that it would make a lot more sense to XML-RCP the results into my site and use &amp;#123;includeMessage&amp;#125; rather than to fetch them with &amp;#123;includeHTTP&amp;#125;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the wireless front, I decided to go for the most inexpensive solution, and picked up a Siemens M101, essentially a cordless DECT modem, for my desktop, and an M105, the same in USB, for the notebook. They have a range of a couple hundred meters, but a speed of just 128K (OK for surfing, since we only have ISDN and we may never be able to get DSL). Total cost: DM 450, less than half the cost of two 11MBit 'Wireless Ethernet' cards, never mind a base station. The PCs see the setup as a direct serial connection, and I can set up PPP for the network.&lt;br /&gt;
I haven't yet, but I can get a terminal window, so I know it's working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I've been intending to update the favorites box. I'm too lazy to update it by hand, so I wanted it to automatically copy (via XML) the favorites I choose on Weblogs.Com. Actually, I was so lazy that I was waiting for someone else to figure how to do this. But since noone has bothered to solve my problem yet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$501&quot;&gt;I took some time yesterday to start writing some perl&lt;/a&gt;.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Late&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I slept 3 hours this afternoon. I had to pick up Christopher after all, and nearly overslept. We need to think of a late-afternoon nutrition plan for him. He comes home from day care hungry (yes, they do feed him!), but a whole banana and an entire yoghurt at 5:30pm tend to ruin his supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Early&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This morning my sore throat is gone and my eyes are less pink. I'm staying home anyway. I don't even have to worry about picking up Christopher. After 3 days of late meetings, Mama's going to take a short day today.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought I felt good this morning and went back to work. That was a mistake. My co-workers all asked me about my red eyes. I didn't even know they were red, but they apparently look like I was on 3 day drinking binge. (Of course, there was noone at home to tell me that my eyes were red, except for the little one and he's not talking yet.) And the dull pain (now on both sides) in my throat is numbed somewhat by paracetamol, but always comes back. This is no ordinary cold, so it's back to the doctor tomorrow morning. But I'm going to bed right now. 20:50 and stop counting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Late&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mama will be back late tonight, and will have been without Christopher for over 48 hours (Monday evening to Thursday morning), I've been sick with some sort of head cold, and Christopher has barely batted an eye. I'm sure he'll be happy to see Mom in the morning, though. But Mom will be even more happy to see him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I sent an SMS to Mama's cell phone for Valentines Day. Does that count?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've been browsing all day with the Opera beta, and I like it. A lot. One wierdness: you can choose what browser Opera claims to be when making a request. The default is IE5, and some sites (i.e. Amazon) get confused by a request from &quot;MSIE 5.0; Linux&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Early&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Several folks have pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edrants.com/_blogyou/&quot;&gt;supposed reviews&lt;/a&gt; of various weblogs. What a pointless task. One might as well criticise how we arrange our patio furniture in the backyard. OK, this is the web, and we've opened our patios to anyone who cares to stop by, but I still arrange my patio furniture to please myself and not anyone else. It's not like we're trying to sell music or movies or create art. We're just being ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those keeping score of Christopher's accomplishments, he's now able to crawl up a complete flight of stairs. I'm not sure if he can crawl all the way down yet; he did manage half a staircase crawling backwards. This is all, of course, under close adult supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm under the weather with a cold and sore throat, and rather than fight it I got a yellow slip from the doctor to stay home from work until Thursday. Mama is out-of-town until late tomorrow, though, and the yellow slip doesn't excuse me from Christopher duty mornings and evenings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody at work wants to administer the FreeBSD machines. We have mostly Linux and Solaris, with just a few special purpose machines running FreeBSD. One of those machines, though, is my webserver, and to make a long story short, I ended up volunteering to become the FreeBSD specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll have to make time to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Online locked up on me today. It kept telling me 'session limit exceeded', meaning it thought I had already logged on and could not log in a second time. Logging in via modem was also blocked. Restarting isdn4linux,disconnecting the cable to the isdn card, and finally disconnecting the entire ntba did not resolve the problem. Rebooting the linux box finally did. Strange (but now I realize I should have checked if both my outgoing lines were really free).&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, my Renault dealer was more than happy to take the Twingo in for a day. Just to make it worth their while, the water pump was leaking, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My department at work found a cool present for me: &quot;K√ºhlschrank Poesie&quot;, a German version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magneticpoetry.com/&quot;&gt;Magnetic Poetry&lt;/a&gt;, on the premise that if Mama and I are both working so hard, we need a means of communication. &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot; (Hmmm, isn't that why we have a weblog?) Problem is, our refrigerator is installed inside our kitchen cabinets, and has no metal door. I also got an official &quot;No &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jever.de/englisch/home/home_frame.htm&quot;&gt;Jever&lt;/a&gt; (beer), No Fun&quot; shirt, along with 4 bottles which I'm sure came out of our server room (thenly room in the office with air conditioning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A site I visit nearly as often as the search engine at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=PapaScott&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is the German-English dictionary http://dict.leo.org in Munich. The dictionary at Chemnitz http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de is also good, and can be downloaded as a Tcl/Tk program &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding&quot;&gt;Ding&lt;/a&gt; for Unix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the well wishes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/2001/02/09&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

I received an early birthday present from fate yesterday afternoon. The muffler fell off the Twingo on the autobahn on my way home from work. Fate was however kind enough to have this happen just before a rest area, so I was able to pack the muffler into the back and continue (loudly) drving. So first thing this morning I get to arrange repairs. Wake up, Christopher, we're driving to Renault!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/02/08/funny-old-world</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Things were hectic at home last evening. Mama was putting out fires on the telephone, using both ISDN lines and my (not her) cell phone at the same time. (Her D1 cell phone from work has no reception in L√ºllau. She says that she hates my phone, but never hesitates to use it without asking.) Three cities (Hamburg, Hannover, Bremen), three problems, three telephones... but only two ears and one mouth. Windows died on my ThinkPad, so I was busy with the Recovery CD (and making sure it didn't touch the Linux partition). And Christopher was busy reorganizing those parts of the kitchen he could reach. By 9 pm we were all exhausted and in bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Mama back on board as the main wage earner, I had to change my tax exemption status back to that of the secondary earner &lt;i&gt;(Lohnsteuerklasse 5)&lt;/i&gt;. My net pay is now 1/3 less than last year, and is just 45% of my gross pay. Last month Mama didn't even notice that it had been posted to our account!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I have to put up with insults from my co-workers: 'Only in America does the pizza come to your door faster than an ambulance.' &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot; And they expect me to bring treats to the office tomorrow? I can think of  39 reasons to stay home in bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure in a couple of weeks we'll no longer think that this is funny or cute. If we were smart parents, we wouldn't have rewarded such behavior by laughing and getting out the camera. But we did, and I'm sure we will suffer the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We were already in upstairs in bed early to rest up for the upcoming Monday when downstairs Mama's cell phone rang. No, it can't be her phone, Mama insisted, since she doesn't have any reception at home. She believed me the second time. I guess her reception at home is only spotty and not non-existant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She went right back to sleep, but I was wide awake with a spark of inspiration for the bug database I'm adapting for work. So here I am programming when I should be sleeping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got nearly 10 cm of snow and it's still coming down. I'm glad I have a Christopher day tomorrow. The rush hour traffic will be a mess, with the snow and the new Elbtunnel construction that was started this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/02/01/energy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Linking to &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; again, this &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/2001/01/31&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; about the energy crisis in California, and whether Americans waste more energy than the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of thoughts. Back when I worked for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.int-res.com&quot;&gt;Inter-Research&lt;/a&gt;, the ecologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/Staff/paul.htm&quot;&gt;Paul Ehrlich&lt;/a&gt; gave a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.int-res.com/eebooks/ee8.html&quot;&gt;lecture&lt;/a&gt; for us. He's well-known for his pessimistic view of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2think.org/tpe.shtml&quot;&gt;population explosion&lt;/a&gt;, but I found it interesting that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dieoff.org/page43.htm&quot;&gt;he uses units of energy to express the impact of population&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The average rich-nation citizen used 7.4 kilowatts (kW) of energy in 1990-a continuous flow of energy equivalent to that powering 74 100-watt lightbulbs. The average citizen of a poor nation, by contrast, used only 1 kW.... Americans are superconsumers, and use inefficient technologies to feed their appetites. Each, on average, uses 11 kW of energy, twice as much as the average Japanese, more than three times as much as the average Spaniard, and over 100 times as much as an average Bangladeshi.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ehrlich said that Germany lies near Spain on this scale, but I'll have to find a source of current statistics.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for our own use of electricity, our last annual bill from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ewe.de&quot;&gt;EWE&lt;/a&gt; was for 5500 kWH. Our monthly bill is Euro 69, and we seem to be paying 12 Eurocents per kWH. If I recall correctly, California rates at their peak were about 10 US cents per kWH.&lt;/p&gt;

W√∂rme has a 50-year old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bgn-demeter.de/hof_woerme_uk.html&quot;&gt;organic farm&lt;/a&gt;, an antique small-gauge train (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wilde-erika.de/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Die Wilde Erika&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) with 1 km of track, a nice patch of &lt;i&gt;Heide&lt;/i&gt; (heather) called the Busenbachtal, and a kiosk that caused a lawsuit because it is technically in a residential area. All this in village smaller than L√ºllau!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher seems to have caught a cold, which explains why he was in a bad mood yesterday. He's wheezing and coughing, has little appetite, but no fever. I was able to pick him up early this afternoon, and he'll spend a quiet day at home tomorrow with Mama. He's actually pretty happy at the moment, as long as he can hold a telephone of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/01/29/sometimes-you-eat-the-bear-and-sometimes-the-bear-eats-you</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, my home office day, the bear ate me. Or maybe I'm just tired from the weekend, since both days Mama I worked and I was in charge of the boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher has learned several new tricks. One is to pull his bib up over his head during mealtimes. If I pull the bib back down and say 'No,' he cries and won't eat. If I leave the bib over his head, his face is covered and he can't eat, although eventually he'll pull the bib completely off and start again with his shirt, which of course has sleeves and cannot be pulled over his head, so he cries and won't eat. Toddler logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also disconcerting that he takes possession of any object he can reach, especially anything that resembles a telephone. Remote controls are OK, and a cordless or, even better, a cell phone is especially good. (Cell phones for toddlers could be a real money maker for the cell phone providers, since toddlers dial at random and never hang up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, a Macintosh mouse, even though it has a cord, is a good substitute for a cordless phone, since itnot only fits in the hand like a telephone, but with the ball underneath can also be pushed across the floor like a car. And, yes, you can probably discern my current opinion of the Macintosh by the fact that I let Christopher play with my Mac mouse and not my PC mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Mama snuck a peak at an E-Mail to her boss, and now figures her chances are up from 98% to 99%. If not 99.9%.&lt;/p&gt;

If I had known the English name was &quot;curd&quot;, I never would have tried it. I'd describe Quark as a cross between yogurt and sour cream, not at all like cottage cheese. I like a 'Quark-Creme' cake, with a mixture of Quark, whipped cream and gelatin poured into a form over strawberries and a shortcake base. &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was an extra day home with Christopher.  I was able to get some work done, mostly because I was up at 5 and Christopher slept in until 10:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was also Mama's meeting with her new √úberboss, the meeting she has been preparing for the past three weeks. She thought that he would have doubts about putting a young mother in a position of responsibility, but the meeting went well. And all the signals she is receiving this week are positive. And, most importantly, she wants the responsibility and is confident that she can handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I placed my trust in her ability when we came to Germany 10 years ago. I knew she would be successful, and I was right, and I got to tag along. (It's not like I'm extra baggage, though; in that time I've learned German and established a career.) Now, of course, we two have become we three, and the stakes are now higher. But I know she will be successful, and this time Christopher and I get to tag along together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we'll see what happens in about 6 weeks. In the meantime, we can finally start our normal routine next week, so that we each spend a weekday home with Christopher, instead of just me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, Mama sold the Fiat! The price was a little less than she wanted, but I've got the big brown bills laying next to me as I type this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama took 'store tours' both Saturday and Sunday, so I spent the weekend (as well as my usual work-at-home Monday) with Christopher. He's been suffering from what can be most delicately referred to as 'loose stool'. Let's just say I've been eaching into it up to my elbows. We've been doing 2 to 3 'complete changes' a day, and just now we took an impromptu bath rather than deal with the situation normally. Desperate times call for desperate measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the work I'm supposedly doing at home today has lain mostly untouched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PS:&lt;/b&gt; Thanks, &quot;andrea&quot; for the good wishes. Christopher isn't really sick. He may be just teething. Our 'Kinderarzt&quot; assures us that despite our frequent visits, Christopher is very healthy and isn't sick any more often than other kids his age.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi Mom and Dad,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the Email... you're right, we haven't been taking enough pictures lately. We'll try to take some this weekend. We tried calling a couple of times this week, but didn't find you home at noon (evenings for us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSE = Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or Mad Cow Disease. It's all over the news here, even after two months, two cabinet members have even resigned, and beef consumption is way down. It makes Mama's job harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're feeling better about things. Mama has decided only to work as long and hard as she can, and to not worry about people who expect any more than that. She's on the road to Bremen and Hannover today and tomorrow (day trips, no overnight). She has a presentation for her boss's new boss next week but things will settle down after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're looking forward to seeing your itinerary for April. We'll try to keep Christopher away from the fax machine so you can fax it. And we (or at least I) will be following the Vikings game Sunday on the Internet. Take care!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott, Mama and Christopher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS We'll send a purse-sized picture so you don't have to be jealous of Violet anymore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what PapaScott thinks we look like as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stor.co.uk/troopers.php&quot;&gt;Stor Troopers&lt;/a&gt;. (First noticed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://singbluesilver.manilasites.com/&quot;&gt;Sing Blue Silver&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa, we're still trying get our bodies and souls into the rhythm of DIOKODC (double income, one kid on day care).&amp;nbsp;Right now we're mostly tired and sometimes a little frustrated.&amp;nbsp;So our postings have been on the lean side of between slim and none the past few days. We'll get over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least Mama has a job title now. Department Head Operations, the more challenging of the options. A job she's done before, but then there were fewer stores, fewer&amp;nbsp;problems,&amp;nbsp;and no BSE.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2001/01/05/working-eek</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 pm&lt;/b&gt; It was a long and frustrating day. Christopher was restless, constantly seeking attention. I couldn't concentrate on work at all. Our entire day care plan will fall apart if I can't get work done on the days I'm with Christopher at home. I had the feeling that there was no way I could meet the expectations I had set for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange thing was, Mama at work was feeling exactly the same. The BSE hysteria is cutting deep into her sales here, and she already is feeling pressure to deliver results quickly, even though (or maybe because) she's been away so long. She couldn't wait to get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she arrived, Christopher returned to his usual happy self. I guess he too has to get used to not spending all day every day with Mom. He went to bed without a whimper, and Mama and I drowned our frustrations in gyros with Greek bread and eggplant paste. Tomorrow we all three have the entire day off together. I hope Christopher won't mind our garlic breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dishwasher was installed today. You can barely tell it's there... fully integrated into the cabinets, and so quiet you can barely tell whether it's running. A present to ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6 am&lt;/b&gt; Christopher made it through his first full week (i.e. 3 full days) of day care. He's more tired than usual. I guess spending all day in a group of kids is more exhausting than spending the day alone with Mom or Dad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is home office day with Dad. Mama's schedule was filled with meetings and information gathering for her first three weeks, with no provision for her to take a weekday off like we planned. Which means I have to spend two weekdays at home instead of one. I'm not particularly happy about that, but my boss is understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got my parking space rented at work, so yesterday I drove all the way in to work for the first time since we moved to the new office. Traffic is a lot lighter at 7am than at 9am... I arrived 15 minutes earlier than I planned. (Although Mama says it because of the holiday week.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unlike last year, when we celebrated the millenium at Harburg General Hospital (when Mama was suffering from fever and was being cooled by cabbage leaves), we're celebrating this millenium at home. Both Mama and Christopher are recovering from colds, so we turned down an offer to go sledding with Christopher's uncle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also won't be going to the fireworks at the harbor in Hamburg. That will be cold, crowded, and with kids throwing firecrackers around, more than a little dangerous. It seems that this time of year normally safety-conscious Germans take leave of their senses. First they put lit candles in their Christmas trees, then they throw firecrackers at one another on New Years Eve. Or fall down drunk into the River Elbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of safety, Christopher is at this moment happily pulling up the little rubber anti-slip mats in the shower. Don't ask why...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't believe the part about the cabbage leaves last year? Here's proof...&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It looks like we've survived the big four... Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, and Christopher's Birthday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we had a white Christmas. We got about 5 inches on Christmas Eve, and it's still on the ground. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de&quot;&gt;Abendblatt&lt;/a&gt;, it was the most snow since 1960. It was a strange storm. It snowed only on the edge of a front, in a band about 40 km wide. We got snow, &quot;andrea&quot;'s parents 50 km west of us got snow, but Hamburg 20 km north of us just got rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is... the dishwasher has given up its ghost. The water pump is burned out, and not worth fixing. A new diswasher has a delivery time of 8 weeks. The good news is... we ordered a new dishwasher 8 weeks ago. &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher likes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anything with wheels
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bananas!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;his jack-in-the-box &quot;Peeks&quot;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;playing with spoons
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;sitting quietly&quot; on the couch
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tropical fruit tea with a dash of apple juice
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talking into a telephone (any inanimate object will do)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dropping things into boxes, behind the changing table, or down the stairs
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doddle-doddle-doddle!
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eating with his fingers
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tearing down Lego towers
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organizing magazines and CDs
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from Christopher and his parents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plans for the day are pretty much the same as &lt;a href=&quot;/1999/12/24&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, except that our evening meal will be quesadillas instead of raclette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this paragraph with the ThinkPad from our kitchen. There's a phone jack there, so I can connect to T-Offline (as long as the LAN upstairs is offline... the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-online.de&quot;&gt;big pink T&lt;/a&gt; doesn't want me logging on twice).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Final Sprint</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher has his final practice day-care session today, his very first full 8am-5pm shift. Day care is closed during the short week between the holidays, and on 2 January he has his first real shift, when Mama and Papa both work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of thought, I've decided to give up my commuter train ticket and rent a parking space at work. Yes, it is more expensive and pollutes the air, but the train runs only twice an hour and it's too easy to miss. The car will be the best way for me to be able to keep my afternoon appointments to pick up Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been practicing working early shifts. 7:30 is a lonely time at the office, especially for a sys admin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of working several hours a week at home, I've bought a used notebook... an IBM ThinkPad 390X. Now we just need to come up with a way to wire our network into the living room... or is wireless the way to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of once again driving a company car, Mama has put an ad in Annoncen Avis to sell the Mama Auto. If anyone is interested in a red Fiat Seicento, just let us know.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Christmas Newsletter</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/12/17/christmas-newsletter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christmas 2000: The news from L√ºllau&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again it's time to summarize the past year onto a single sheet of paper suitable for mailing. (Those of you reading this on PapaScott get to see it sooner and without killing any trees.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christopher...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will be celebrating his first birthday on December 27. Parenting has been just as strenuous as we thought it would be, but more joyous than we ever could imagine. We never realized how quickly a tiny helpless baby could develop into a curious, happy, friendly, independent-minded, trouble-seeking little boy, and how much fun it would be to watch and be a part of that process. On the progress chart, he's able to stand and walk with the help of furniture, and just learned to open kitchen cupboards. It's time to start learning the word &quot;no,&quot; which could be a long lesson for both parents and child. (Webpage note: At this very moment, Christopher is happily tossing his Legos through the railing down two flights of stairs to the basement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been trying to keep track of our progress on our website, and Christopher also has an online photo album at http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumList?u=185392.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our jobs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tt's employer has gone through the ups and downs that all Internet companies have gone through this year. The stock was up to 50 Euros in February, but now is back down to the single digits. Scott's department is luckily a quiet haven in a constantly changing company. His job has become more technical with less web design; he works with apache, Lotus Domino and SSL, to name a few buzzwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year of maternity leave, Mama will be returning to work on January 2. She hasn't yet been told what she will be doing, but we're sure she'll be kept busy. The important thing is that Christopher will be well cared for. We plan that he will go to private day care 3 days a week (he's been practicing since the end of November). Scott will be able to work at home on Mondays, and Mama will work every Saturday, taking a day off during the week. So Christopher will be able to spend 4 days a week with one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Travels and Family&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandma and Grandpa Hanson came to visit Christopher in April, and were able to attend his baptism. Christopher returned the favor in October, staying first in Arizona for a few days, then in Minnesota for 2 weeks. Flying with Christopher went just fine, but next time we'll pay for a separate seat. Seven hours is a long time to sit in a narrow seat with a baby in your lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oma will be moving next summer from Eckernf√∂rde to Buchholz, just 3 miles from L√ºllau. She'll be closer to all of her grandchildren. The family Christmas dinner will be L√ºllau on the 25th, featuring a traditional menu of roasted goose, potatoes and gravy, red cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and coffee with way too much cake for dessert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cats took some time to get used to Christopher. They are, after all, no longer that young and are pretty set in their ways. After several weeks of pretending he didn't exist (and a prolonged hunger strike by Helga), they seemed to have settled on a pattern of peaceful co-existence (you don't pull my tail, and I won't bite your hand).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Person 2000</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/12/13/person-2000/"/>
   <updated>2000-12-13T20:12:12+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/12/13/person-2000</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past two weeks, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de&quot;&gt;Hamburger Abendblatt&lt;/a&gt; newspaper and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ndr4.de&quot;&gt;NDR4&lt;/a&gt; radio have been presenting candidates for the 'Person of the Year', to be selected by their readers and listeners. I thought it would be interesting to copy the list here, along with translations of the short descriptions, to see who German journalists think have characterised the past year, and how they chose to describe them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rudi V√∂ller (saviour of German soccer)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angela Merkel (saviour of the CDU, led the party out of its biggest crisis)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferdinand Pi√©ch (brought the first serious 3 liter (80 mpg) auto to market)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heike Drechsler (gold medal winer, world class for nearly 20 years, became a national heroine in Sydney)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hans Eichel (the Chancellor's joker card, made forgotten traits popular again - saving money and repaying debt)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Britney Spears (pop icon)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sieghard Straka / Wim Ouboter (inventors of the kickboard)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vojislav Kostunica (symbol of the women and men of the Belgrade Autumn)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birgit Breuel (the untouchable, survived the Expo)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Schumacher (Formula 1 champion)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nadeschda Tylika (mother of the sailor and Kursk-victim Sergei)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Craig Venter (father of the Genome Project)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cathy Freeman (gold medal winner, brought the Olympic flame into the stadium as well as Aborigines and immigrants closer together)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hubertus Schmoldt (during wage negoitions, set a new tone in the spirit of the 'Alliance for Work
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joachim Gauck (has sorted Stasi files for 10 years)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joanne K. Rowling (author of Harry Potter)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Some of the German candidates require some explanation to those abroad: Rudi V√∂ller is German national team coach, Ferdinand Pi√©ch is head of Volkswagen, Heike Drechsler has been a track-and-field star for both the DDR and unified Germany, Hans Eichel is Finance Minister, Birgit Breuel was in charge of Expo 2000, Hubertus Schmoldt leads the Union of the Mining/Chemisitry/Engery Industries, Joachim Gauck was co-founder of the New Forum and now heads the bureau for organising and releasing the files of the old DDR secret police, the Stasi.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Advent, Advent, ein Anzug brennt</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/12/11/advent-advent-ein-anzug-brennt/"/>
   <updated>2000-12-11T20:12:16+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/12/11/advent-advent-ein-anzug-brennt</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In December, the clock seems to be running at double-time, as if the year were trying to make up for time lost during the dog days of summer. Is it possible to have a moment for oneself? Or is every free minute already booked until next year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/2000/12/11&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt;, we've managed to avoid having to shop on an Advent Saturday (which the German equivalent of 'hell on earth'). Well, almost. Mama was convinced that I needed a new suit for her company Christmas party next weekend (her first formal appearance after maternity leave, although she officially starts on January 2). My main criteria in choosing a profession was to avoid wearing suits. I hate buying clothes, but it's even worse to discuss or even argue about buying clothes, so I kept my mouth shut (well, nearly shut) and went along with Mama and Christopher to Hamburg early on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Policke, an old-fashioned men's clothier in Hamburg... not chic downtown Hamburg, but the nitty, gritty inner-city neighborhood of St. Georg, located across from a Turkish bank and some porno shops, between a mosque and a Good Templar's Club. The shop looks like it hasn't been remodeled since the 1920s, and maybe the staff hasn't changed since then either. There's hardly room to move... the tiny rooms are stuffed with suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's impossible to browse. You are met at the door by the chief salesman, who measures your exact size by eye alone, and are sent to the appropriate room. I told the salesman there I need a dark colored suit for a Christmas party, he picked two out that both fit perfectly and met Mama's approval. I picked one, and we were out in 15 minutes, paying a least a third less than we would have downtown, and were home before the crowds arrived in the citry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the pants needed to be altered. That cost DM 6 extra, and I have to go back on Wednesday. Maybe I'll stop at the mosque and say a prayer for the Christmas shoppers who didn't make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry about the big picture, but then again this is a big moment for Christopher. His &quot;Day Care Mother&quot; Heidi posed with the whole crew for this picture. As much as Christopher enjoys being around other kids I had to to swallow real hard today for the first time after I dropped him off this morning. Both Scott and I have a good feeling about Heidi. She's a real pro at her job and a really nice person at the same time. She founded the Regional Day Care Organization 16 years ago, founded the State Day Care Organization of Lower Saxony, is part of a National Education Council and a few other organizations. At the same time, Day Care in Germany lacks the social acceptance it deserves. Many of my Americans friends think that it's great I was able to take a whole year off work to be home with Chriopher. On the other hand many of my German friends are shocked that I want to go back to work after only a year at home. Little do they know how I had to hold myself back for the past 3 months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hosts J√∂rg and Susanne in Munich treated Christopher to a Bavarian breakfast: a fresh pretzel with butter and honey. It was amazing how all three could stick in his hair. And his face. And his clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J√∂rg insisted that Christopher roll up his sleeves for the true Bavarian look. At least he didn't insist on Lederhosen!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the very strange but true department: in front of our office today about 30 demonstrators protested against the Internet. The protest was aimed at the main tenants of our building, AOL Germany and Bertelsmann Online, with signs reading 'Where is our Internet' and chants of 'Wir sind das Netz' and 'Ihr seid drin, wir sind drau√üen' (a play on AOL Germany's ad campaign with Boris Becker, 'Bin ich drin?'). The best sign was 'Ficken statt Klicken', which can only be paraphrased as 'Make Love instead of Clicks.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the protesters also carried over half a dozen video cameras, so I am guessing that the protest was staged as part of some student film project. But it was fun nontheless.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We'll be in Munich this weekend, visiting a friend of Mama from work. Mama and Christopher are flying for free (she has flyer miles, he's too young for a ticket). I get to pay full price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher got a clean bill of health from his pediatrician yesterday, so he'll be going today to his first day of &quot;nursery school&quot; (that's what his Grandpa calls the &lt;i&gt;Tagesmutter&lt;/i&gt;; it's really just day care). He'll stay just 2 hours today. It's just a practice session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama still doesn't know what they will be wanting her to do at work when she goes back on January 1. She says that her gut feeling is they have big plans for her right away. And we thought we could just ease into 2-career parenting... we might have to jump in feet first with our eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about if we award the election to the first one who starts behaving like a president and a statesman, you know, with honor and dignity and all that. But then again, maybe neither one would win...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm guilty. I ran upstairs to get something - no, I did not check up on my stocks. When I returned, Christopher was sitting on the dishwasher door. I should be happy our son takes such a keen interest in household appliances. Before we know it he might volunteer to unload the dishes. Luckily the camera was right there on the kitchen counter. Obviously, the ear infection doesn't seem to bother him at all. Looks like we can start the nursery school practice sessions on Monday.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a high fever over the weekend, we thought Christopher was over it on Monday. But he isn't. He's got an ear infection, so it's back on antibiotics, and no play groups for a week. But he doesn't look or act sick, and his appetite is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is just another work day for me, but Christopher will be celebrating with a toddler-sized jar of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hipp.de&quot;&gt;Hipp&lt;/a&gt; turkey and vegetables!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our excitement of staying-home-while-Mom's-on-a-business-trip, we forgot to put out the trash on Monday night. That's bad. Our only trashbin is plump full of diapers, and the next pick-up is in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sunny and cool today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another home office day. I'm getting more accomplished than I thought I would. My boss will be happy. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there is not Linux Notes client, we use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citrix.com&quot;&gt;Citrix Metaframe&lt;/a&gt; to access Notes on NT. It even works at home, tunneling through ssh over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to now, the main drawback of Metaframe was having only 256 colors. But now they have a new client that allows up to 16 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing I read weblogs. Then I don't need a calendar. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt;, I realized Thanksgiving is this week and not next (we don't have any US calendars around the house), and thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com&quot;&gt;Al&lt;/a&gt;, I remembered to pick up some new Beaujolais Primeuer from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aldi.de&quot;&gt;gourmet store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is my first attempt at a work-at-home day. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three upper teeth appeared during the night, bringing Christopher's tooth total to 6. &lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; After performing a hand recount, we decided that indeed 4 teeth have broken through on top. (Mama adds that they are not quite big enough to completely punch through the card yet, so a machine count wouldn't pick them all up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20001112&amp;amp;mode=classic&quot;&gt;Today's User Friendly&lt;/a&gt; has the real reason the count in Florida is taking so long...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main project this weekend was Christopher-proofing the upstairs, removing all computers and cables from the floor in our office room, and installing a child-proof gate on the stairway. This involved drilling holes in our beloved free-standing wooden staircase, which we really wanted to avoid. But the staircase is not sturdy enough for metal tension gate we got from Ikea. So we have to live with the holes. I decided to use bolts instead of wood screws. Hopefully the clean hole will be easier to patch later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of all this is to for Christopher to be able to stay upstairs semi-attended, so that I can work one day a week at home after Mama goes back to work in January. We've arranged for 3 days of day-care per week. I'll work at home on Mondays, and Mama will arrange to have either Wednesday or Friday off and then to work a weekend day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Election</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And here I thought the election would be decided by 6am when I woke up this morning. But at 6am it was not yet decided, by 8am Bush had won, and by 10am it was undecided again. I'm sure glad I didn't stay up all night for this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have only contempt and absolutely no respect for either candidate, this is actually the best outcome I could have hoped for. Let the final outcome linger for another day or two... and no matter what it is, the winner cannot feel that he has truly won, and will be a crippled president; the loser will not feel that he has truly lost, and his political career will be over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the result make any difference to Germany at all? I doubt it. Relations between Europe and America after the Cold War have become subtle, complicated and boring; not the stuff for modern politicians. They leave the details to the professional diplomats, whose job it is to be subtle, complicated and boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night Christopher went on his first 'Laternenumzug', a children's ritual to welcome the fall. They march around the town with paper lanterns, singing a special lantern song. None of the adults present were le to tell me what it meant (except that it must be part of the German &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.faz.com/IN/INtemplates/eFAZ/docmain.asp?rub=&amp;#123;AFE53608-1A96-11D4-B984-009027BA226C&amp;#125;&amp;amp;doc=&amp;#123;DEDA5153-AB21-11D4-A3B2-009027BA22E4&amp;#125;&quot;&gt;Leitkultur&lt;/a&gt;, something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehouseatthebridge.com/TravelInfo/CurryWurst.html&quot;&gt;Currywurst&lt;/a&gt;, I guess &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot;), but a search on Google revealed that it has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.germanschoolatlanta.com/english/events/lanternenumzug.html&quot;&gt;something to do with St. Martin's Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vision Thing</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/11/04/vision-thing/"/>
   <updated>2000-11-04T05:11:15+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/11/04/vision-thing</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the US election nears (I sent in my absentee ballot a couple of weeks ago), the most remarkable thing about the two main candidates is that they are both totally unremarkable. Niether one has been able to express in broad terms what they intend to do once they take office, to be able to say that they are in it for the people and not just for themselves. They both seem to want to be in power simply for the sake of being in power. Niether one seems to have that vision thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vision seems to have become rare in politicians. Ronald Reagan had it, Tony Blair has it, Gerhard Schr√∂der has a little bit of it. Bill Clinton doesn't have it, he's the ultimate power-for-the-sake-of-power poltician. But he got elected twice, and it seems that vision is more of a liability than an asset for a modern candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I was reminded of while in the States is the inability of the American system to be able to solve big, divisive issues. When I started college 20 years ago, these were issues like abortion, gun control, and health care. Has any progress been made since then in finding a solution to these issues so that they can be put behind us? At all? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bomb Scare</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/11/02/bomb-scare/"/>
   <updated>2000-11-02T19:11:03+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/11/02/bomb-scare</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday a 500 pound American bomb from World War II was disarmed just across the street from my office. It was discovered by construction workers at the Bavaria St. Pauli brewery the day before. All buildings within 200 yards were evacuated, all streets were closed within 500 yards, as were the U- and S-Bahn. The red-light district on the Reeperbahn was deserted. We weren't allowed to leave our building for 3 hours. And production was halted at the brewery for an entire day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg was very heavily bombed during the war, and out of the hundreds of thousands of bombs that were dropped, some 10% were duds. Even today, a new one is discovered every month or so, usually at construction sites. A bomb survey is required for any building permit in Hamburg. Aerial photos taken by the US and British air forces after the bombing raids are examined... the duds are visible in the photos as pinholes without craters. However, the bomb yesterday was not discovered by a photograph, but by an unlucky bulldozer driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparations took over 24 hours, but the bomb itself was disarmed in just 15 minutes. In theory, one just needs to unscrew the detonator with a decent wrench. In practice, nothing that has been underground for 60 years comes apart very easily. I'm certainly happy that I don't work for Hamburg's 'Kampfmittelr√§umdienst'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if a rich country like Germany is still cleaning up from a war 60 years ago, how long will it take for the scars to heal in Vietnam, or Iraq, or Bosnia, or Kosovo, or Rwanda, or Angola, or ...?&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheila.inessential.com/2000/10/28&quot;&gt;Sheila&lt;/a&gt; had a link to a CNN story about Halloween in France. Here in Germany, trick-or-treaters rang over a dozen times at Mama's brother's place in Holm-Seppensen. And Hamburg is full of posters for Halloween M&amp;amp;Ms. Can it be a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$426?mode=day&quot;&gt;Andrea wrote in&lt;/a&gt; that she'd never heard of of German kids celebrating Halloween before. I have a feeling that somehow kids in Holm-Seppensen learned about Halloween in school, and decided to try it out to see if they could really get candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooops... the blue shoes give him away. &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot; This picture was taken 2 weeks ago on my uncle's farm in Minnesota. Christopher usually chews on dead leaves when he finds them in the house, but outside I guess there were so many that he couldn't decide which one to put in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He seems to be completely over his illness. He's on antibiotics and a mucous-loosener for the rest of the week, and no cold drafts or groups of children until the week is over. We'll check in with the pediatrician on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher says thanks to &quot;andrea&quot; and &quot;al&quot; for the good wishes. (Actually, he's really saying &quot;Get me out of this stupid hairnet!&quot; Sorry, guy, you need it to keep your IV from flapping in the wind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've finally got our vacation pictures up at &quot;photopoint&quot;, sorted by date but with no comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was with Christopher most of the afternoon, giving Mama a chance to get out. His blood gas is now normal, say the doctors. As a layman, I would say that he's at 90% and should be back to normal by the weekend in time to face Roger Clemens in Game 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I'm at 90% too, and will be going back to work tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher's fever is gone. His appetite his back but not yet normal. The doctors are concerned with his blood gas... it's too alkaline, but may not be directly related to the pneumonia. They're taking urine samples to check his kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No word yet on when he might be able to come home. They said 10 days when he was admitted, so that means next Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama's getting bored. She's asked for relief tomorrow afternoon, even though I'm not quite healthy yet. I'll bring my Palm, and try out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.landware.com/gotype/classic.html&quot;&gt;GoType keyboard&lt;/a&gt; I got in the States. Maybe I can get some writing done.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evening update:&lt;/b&gt; Christopher ate a little for the first time, and he's been filling urine sample bags quite regularly. His blood oxygen his excellent, but blood gas is only so-so. He's starting to say doddle-doddle-doddle and daddle-daddle-daddle again, so he's returning to his usual self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally went in to see Christopher at the Mariahilf clinic this morning. I only stayed for 10 minutes, since I‚Äôm at the endphase wheezing-and-coughing stage of my illness. Christopher was awake, but groggy, and he‚Äôs wearing a cute hairnet for his IVs. The doctors are unhappy with his blood values, but he‚Äôs slowly getting better. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama is hanging in there too. She's been with him pretty much 24/7 since he was admitted on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maricopa County (Arizona) was kind enough spend $21 to send my absentee ballot by Express Mail. I‚Äôll be sending it back today, via normal air mail. I only voted for the federal races, skipping the local offices and the propositions (except for one banning non-language classes in public schools not taught in English‚Ä¶ we couldn‚Äôt let that get by without a NO).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Fever is down even further, but the two blood values the doctors are interested are still up, indicating a medium-sized lung infection. He's taking in fluids well, and starting to eat some. Christopher is in a 'single room with parent's bed', so Mama is with him all the time. I'll be taking shifts as soon as I am certified healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world does not only revolve around Christopher‚Ä¶&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Text: &quot;An open operating system doesn't only have advantages&quot;.) According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org&quot;&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, it's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/articles/00/10/21/1644248.shtml&quot;&gt;first Microsoft ad that directly targets Linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Christopher's fever is down to 38&amp;deg;C (100.4&amp;deg;F), he's stable, and already flirting with the nurses. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are only getting worse here. We took Christopher to the pediatrician on Thursday morning, and were told to keep giving him aspirin and to come back Monday if he didn't get any better. He didn't get better, and the aspirin didn't keep the fever down. We called the pediatrician today, who said not to panic and to wait another day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't follow her advice. Mama took Christopher to the nearest children's clinic and they diagnosed pneumonia. He will be in the hospital for the next 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I'm on antibiotics and bed rest for the next few days, so I can't even go visit him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt;, for the get-well wishes. And yes, we did notice the &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/pictures/viewer$1334&quot;&gt;hippos&lt;/a&gt; from the Expo :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to Christopher's Grandma and Grandpa in Minnesota, where he doesn't need his shades anymore. We went from 38&amp;deg;C in Phoenix to 4&amp;deg;C here. We might even see snow tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working a week with modems on borrowed computers, I miss my German ISDN line. I especially miss not having to share a computer with Mama (what, she wants to check her stocks again?!?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been trying to collect our thoughts about comparing life in Germany and in the US, since my father signed us on to do a presentation for his Kiwanis club next Monday. My first impression: the US has changed a lot less than Germany has since I've moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; asked what her readers were doing for German reunification 10 years ago, and I &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$1281&quot;&gt;answered&lt;/a&gt; on her site.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Greetings from Arizona</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/09/29/greetings-from-arizona</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We made it to Arizona at midnight Thursday morning. The temperature at that time (over 90F) was warmer than the entire summer in Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher travelled much better than either of us, as I expected. We had normal tourist-class seats with Christopher on my lap. He slept, I couldn't move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending yesterday in jet-lag limbo, we're going to try to enjoy the sun today. We had Mexican food last night, tomorrow night we'll go to our first major league baseball game in over 6 years. It's little things like that that I miss. But not often.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pack Day</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/09/26/pack-day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we pack, tomorrow we fly. Mama is already asking why I'm waiting until day. She claims to already be done with her things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying to stick to a single suitcase of clothes for the two of us. Christopher gets 3, with all his toys, sleep material, accesories, formula (as far as I can tell, hypo-allegenic formula is not available in the US except from a physician), food and diapers for the first couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully everything will work for the camera. We only have two compact flash cards, and no laptop, so we have to find a way to upload somehow. We'll bring all the cables and the card reader. We have two sets of rechargable batteries, but the charger only runs on 230 V. I also burned a fresh CD with pictures... over 1500 files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sunday, in between packing and dealing with teething pain, we went to our 2nd 'Krabbelgottesdienst', a 'crawling' church service for toddlers, to celebrate the harvest. Christopher actually paid attention and seemed to enjoy the singing and the hand-clapping, foot-stomping parts.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A big load off my shoulders today... the new company website is online, nearly two months late and just two working days before we fly to the US! I would have preferred that it be up running for a month before skipping off, but 48 hours is a good burn-in time, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Mama's done the lion's share of planning and preparation for our trip. We've done plenty o trips between Europe and the US, but adding Christopher to the equation will make things roughly twice as complicated, I'm guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fly first to Phoenix for a week, then to Minnesota for 2 weeks. We'll be visiting friends and family... no time to play tourist!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To bad we didn't do the weblog shootout yesterday... we would have had a lot of fun pictures. We're having the patio extended behind the carport, and a mini-backhoe rumbled through our backyard to haul away the dirt. We also had bath day with Christopher, attended a baby-flea-market in Holm-Seppensen (we spent DM 10 for a stocking cap, a bottle warmer, and a Fisher-Price radio), we had a very pregnant visitor, and I started reorganizing my desk, moving the secondary PCs to the shelves behind me. Today all we have planned is swimming at the Salztherme (salt spa) in L√ºneburg.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Christophers Guide to the Expo</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/09/04/christophers-guide-to-the-expo/"/>
   <updated>2000-09-04T18:09:49+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/09/04/christophers-guide-to-the-expo</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went to the Expo expecting to be cynical. Corporate glossy visions&lt;br /&gt;
of the future... you can already get that at Disneyland, right?&lt;br /&gt;
Thankfully, my expectations were not met. We arrived early, stayed&lt;br /&gt;
late, did not exhaust or bankrupt ourselves, and had a good time. We&lt;br /&gt;
didn't plan a strategy ahead of time, but looking back, our plan was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Avoid the long lines. There are about 10 major attractions with long&lt;br /&gt;
lines, and we skipped most of them. There are hundreds of things to see&lt;br /&gt;
without any line at all. The most spectacular attraction, the 21st&lt;br /&gt;
Century, has the longest line. If we go again, we'll to rush there&lt;br /&gt;
right at opening time. Hopefully it won't rain next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Baby carriage accessible? Mostly. We were scared from the lofty&lt;br /&gt;
Holland pavillion by both the line and the many stairs, but most of&lt;br /&gt;
the halls are handicapped accessible. We carried Christopher into&lt;br /&gt;
several smaller exhibits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Lots of rest stops. Christopher was often hungry, thirsty, tired, or&lt;br /&gt;
needed changing. Don't rush, stay flexible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Hungry? Use connections if you got them (Mama's employer is a&lt;br /&gt;
sponsoring partner of the Expo), or go ethnic. The country booths have&lt;br /&gt;
better and cheaper food than the stands outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Avoid the propaganda. Concentrate on the country booths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did we see? A rather large country in North America was not&lt;br /&gt;
represented at all, but we did see Sri Lanka, Australia, Andorra,&lt;br /&gt;
Israel, Egypt, Malta, Luxembourg, France, United Arab Emeriates,&lt;br /&gt;
Latvia, Lithuania, United Kingdom, Norway, Brazil, Canada, Iceland&lt;br /&gt;
(fron the outside) and Vietnam (for dinner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My highlight? Germany.  The pavillion was lavish, well thought out, planned to the last detail, and&lt;br /&gt;
maybe too perfect, but showed a happy, thoughtful ,prosperous and&lt;br /&gt;
diverse country that Germany could become. As someone who lives here&lt;br /&gt;
by choice, I hope that's the direction it will really go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;One thought I couldn't get out of my mind for a long time last night was &quot;Why is Germany hosting the EXPO 2000 and therefore the world and can't control the problems with right-wing extremism&quot;??? I'm ashamed to read headlines like this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/09/02/german.neo/index.html&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;! How many citizens and government officials have looked the other way for years to have come to accept a sort of nationalist sentiment in some Germans! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very much ashamed of my fellow citizens who are disoriented in their way of thinking. 21 years ago I was an AFS High School Exchange Student in the US and I frequently dealt with questions about the &quot;German  Conscience&quot; in relation to the Holocaust. I never thought Right Wing Nationalists would be marching in Germany ever again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly politicians are thinking what can be done to stop this mental disease. I like a proposal from the Socialdemocrat Party: if convicted of right-wing activities your driver's license may be revoked for a minimum of 10 years. That just might be an effective way to give some disoriented young people a moment to think about what they might be about to do!&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Expo was much better than we expected. As we drove home we decided to try for a second visit. Here for some first impressions:&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;plaza&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here's a shot of the famous Expo Plaza.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;jerusalem&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here's a picture of our happy fmily at the Israel exhibit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;We would have liked to have seen the Icelandic Exhibit. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unfortunately it was closed for maintenance when we stopped by the first time. I think one of the geysers was broken. When it was open again, we were on our way out and Christopher was desperate for his evening bottle!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cut off!&lt;/b&gt; Our flatrate Internet provider has closed all accounts and filed for bankruptcy! Good thing we only had one month left on our prepaid account.

   <title>First Day of School</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/08/25/first-day-of-school</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama's nephew (and godson) Lennart starts first grade tomorrow. In Germany, starting first grade is a Very Big Deal, the first step in coming-of-age. The new &lt;i&gt;ABC Schutzen&lt;/i&gt; (ABC shooters) are celebrated with a &lt;i&gt;Schult√ºte&lt;/i&gt; full of candy and goodies, a brand new school bag (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.der-echte-scout.de&quot;&gt;name brands&lt;/a&gt; start at DM 150), and a party for selected relatives and guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lennart's school has thoughtfully made the first day a Saturday, so that the selected relatives and guests have no excuse not to participate. The festivities begin with a church service at 9 am, and continue through to the obligatory coffee and cake in the late afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net result is that even the not-so-interested spouse of the godmother has to block out an entire Saturday from his calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started first grade, I might have gotten an apple, but probably not. I think my mother was just happy to finally have me out of her hair for the whole day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German elementary schools are only half day, by the way. That makes life complicated or working parents.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For quite some time Christopher's favorite seemed to be &quot; Da Da Da&quot;.  I couldn't figure out what he meant by saying that. He must have noticed because he switched to saying &quot;Mum Mum Mum&quot;. Usually he says that right before, during or after his  meals. Maybe he's learned that his Mom has a lot do with his meals.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Christopher is also starting to enjoy his weekly  bath.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here are the latest headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Broccoli refused&lt;/b&gt; After the success of homemade carrot pure√©, the introduction of homemade broccoli pure√© was a total flop. So Mama and I had broccoli pure√© with our supper last night. Maybe next time we can make broccoli pancakes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bigger car seat&lt;/b&gt; Over the weekend we tested the toddler car seat, which is higher and faces the front. Christopher is just big enough for it, and enjoyed the better view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;His own luggage&lt;/b&gt; Inquiries at Northwest/KLM revealed that Christopher is entitled to 10 kg of his own luggage, including a EU-approved car seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doing the crawl&lt;/b&gt; A colleague told me that babies go through 7 stages before finally learning to crawl. Christopher must be on about stage 4. He slides on his belly, keeps one arm to his chest, and somehow manages to move forward. He's actually quite quick, and can now move and see where he is going at the same time.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm doing way too much. Overtime at work... we're launching our main site at the end of the month, I need to put together a quick bug database for Hanover 'by yesterday', and Leipzig needshelp importing a banking frontend into Lotus Notes. And I should really help Singapore for a few days, but don't know when or if I can fit it in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, there is the small matter of a wife and son at home that are much more important than anything at work and need daily attention. So the weblog is suffering. So it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

The sunken Russian submarine&lt;/a&gt; is the main story here, with special reports after the Tagesschau. I suffered extreme claustrophobia just from reading the submarine scenes in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cryptonomicon.com/&quot;&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally, a movie for which the German title is better than the original. Usually, the translations are pretty 'd√§mlich'. But 'Chicken Run' is in German is 'Hennen Rennen'. &lt;i&gt;Genial!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first came to Germany, it bothered me that all the imported movies were dubbed, rather than subtitled as in the States. Even when I didn't understand the language, I thought I could pick things up from hearing the original voices. Then I saw my first German-dubbed American movie, Pretty Woman, and I realized that for the vast majority of movies it doesn't make any difference. Junk is junk in any language. &lt;i&gt;Schrott bleibt Schrott!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That explains the funny text at the top of the page. (Hey, the rules said that the weblogger only has to speak German, not that the weblog itself is in German! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it really matters to anyone but me, but I resolved over the weekend to switch my desktop PC from Linux to FreeBSD. I've been up and running since Saturday, and am slowly adding ports (ie extra programs) to my system.&lt;/p&gt;

I list favorites for my own use only. I've gone back to a fixed list. It's somewhat out of date. I'd really like to include the updated favorites list from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weblogs.com&quot;&gt;weblogs&lt;/a&gt;, but it is just too slow. Maybe I'll write a script to feed the favorites into my layout...&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blame it on the Pinot Grigio... last night, Mama and I realized that 10 years ago this month, we were busily preparing for our move to Germany, not having any idea what would await us. We had made the decision rather suddenly... we know that on the day of the 1990 World Cup Final, in late July, we had not yet made up our minds, since we jokingly said that if Germany would win then we would go. Germany did win, we settled our affairs in roughly 3 weeks, and we arrived in Hamburg on Sept 1. We had two luggage carts; one full of suitcases, the other full of cats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, we spent much more time deciding and planning our move from Minneapolis to Phoenix 18 months earlier than our move to Germany. We never intended to stay here permanently... maybe 5 years or so? We still don't intend to stay here forever.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hew-cyclassics.de&quot;&gt;HEW CyClassics&lt;/a&gt; is being held today, and many streets are closed so that the World Cup cyclists can do a couple of laps around Hamburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than risking running into Gabriele Missaglia on his way to winning the World Cup race, we instead took Christopher to the animal park &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildpark-schwarze-berge.de/&quot;&gt;Schwarze Berge&lt;/a&gt; (not the same park as we visited in April, but the idea is the same).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Without Glasses</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/31/without-glasses/"/>
   <updated>2000-07-31T19:07:30+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/31/without-glasses</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher is now 7 months old. Here's a quick list of his accomplishments to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's completely finished nursing. He's drinking HA (hypo-allergenic) formula mornings and evenings, a glass of vegetables at noon, and a glass of fruit in the afternoon. We just got a &quot;Baby's Cookbook&quot; with some nutrition hints.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His diapers have increased in volume and pugnancy proportional to his intake of solid food. He likes to roll on the diaper table, not yet appreciating the drop to the floor.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's not crawling yet, but has increased his speed and mobility in rolling. He can roll across the living room in 2 seconds flat. It's definitely time to get guard rails for the stairs.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's become dangerously interested in cables and any loose objects within reach. He shakes things wildly in the air, and is surprised that it hurts when he hits himself in the head.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's sleeping long and soundly through the night, and naps for a couple of hours in the afternoon. Sometimes he naps in the morning too.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He makes all sorts of different sounds, like he's testing the pitch and loudness of his voice. Sometimes it sounds like he's auditioning for the soundtrack of a horror film.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've taken him swimming twice, and his baths have become more active and wet (for parents and child) as a result.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mama thinks that he's already saying 'Mama', but to me it sounds like he's philosophizing about mammon or mums. Or he's learning the words to Surfing Bird.
&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our continuing attempt to catch up with the culture of the 20th century, we watched &quot;Lola Rennt&quot; (Run Lola Run) on DVD last night. It tells the same story 3 times, with various twists so that the endings are completely different, and ends by running the credits backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovered by accident: &lt;a href=&quot;http://WWW.GermanyByNET.com&quot;&gt;GermanyByNET.com&lt;/a&gt;, a cheesy German-American portal. However, they do have links to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.GermanyByNET.com/newsbot.asp?mode=AFP&quot;&gt;German news stories in English&lt;/a&gt;, and are sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.GermanDeli.com&quot;&gt;GermanDeli.com&lt;/a&gt;, where Americans can order German grocery products (read: coffee and chocolate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been 5 days since the Concorde crash, but it continues to dominate the headlines here, even in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kreiszeitung-wochenblatt.de&quot;&gt;little weekly shopper&lt;/a&gt;. There I learned today that one of the victims lived just 5 km away in Buchholz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;NetDyslexics&lt;/a&gt; this weekend! They're getting militant about &lt;a href=&quot;http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com/swoc&quot;&gt;Sw/oC (Sundays without computers)&lt;/a&gt;, and are punishing everyone who visits their site with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/images/netdyslexia/alien.gif&quot;&gt;horrible blinking background graphic&lt;/a&gt;. But something has gone wrong! The background's already been switched on, and it's still Saturday in most of the world! Including Jena! The horror, the horror...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://Mama.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Mama&lt;/a&gt;, in case you haven't noticed, is taking a hopefully brief hiatus from her weblog. Her excuse is that, since she has stopped nursing Christopher, the title &lt;a href=&quot;http://Mama.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Nursing 'n Surfing&lt;/a&gt; is no longer appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A TV film crew is in L√ºllau, filming at the farm place across the street. Mama says that Heinz Reincke (Germans will know who he is... he looks like the typical North German grandpa, even though he actually lives in Vienna) had to drive 6 times down our street for the camera. The scene being filmed this evening seemed to involve a big white billy goat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our office was on the Hamburg Harbor, I'd see film crews there practicall every week. Our new office, though, is on the wrong part of the Reeperbahn to attract any film crews. The red light district is at the other end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Christopher took his morning nap. I played with some layout ideas in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.weblogs.com/&quot;&gt;Tech Diary&lt;/a&gt;. The calendar is too wide for the navigation column in Windows, so I'm trying out a separate &quot;window&quot; to the side, with the favorites update underneath. I love the favorites macro, but I don't like the fixed layout and even less that it forces the entire page to wait until it's loaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;NetDyslexics&lt;/a&gt; have shunted the calendar and their favorites to the bottom of the page, leaving only an anchor link at the top. That's a good idea too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited my old work colleagues at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.int-res.com&quot;&gt;Inter-Research&lt;/a&gt;. They still recognized me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DVD Alert&lt;/b&gt; This eveningwe sent Christopher to bed early to watch our first DVD, a film that we missed last year. Matrix. We give it the highest possible compliment for Norwegian-Americans: not bad. Totally not bad.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hamburger-dom.de/englisch_frame.html&quot;&gt;Dom&lt;/a&gt; in Hamburg, which is not a cathedral, but instead the biggest carnival in northern Europe, running 3 times a year for 4 weeks at a time. The summer Dom starts next Friday. It's located on the Heiligengeistfeld, just behind my office building. They already started assembling the giant ferris wheel last week, which we can watch from our Marketing&lt;br /&gt;
department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name Dom is an historical play on words. The carnival started in the 10th century as a church market. The church itself burned down in 1803, but the name has stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dom is pretty much like the midways at the state or county fairs in Minnesota or &lt;a href=&quot;http://vfih.editthispage.com/2000/07/22&quot;&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, but without the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were pretty tired afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this afternoon both wife and child are sound asleep. Mama claimed that I was snoring too loud for her to sleep well last night, but I didn't hear a thing!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>House Warming</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At work we held a 'Carribean House Warming' party for employees and invited guests, including Mama and Christopher, who even earned a few brownie points by schmoozing with the CEO.  Christopher held out for 3 hours, quite good actually, considering the loud music and poor accoustics. The company even announced that it might even start making money this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, at home my new toy is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hardware.mp3.com/hardware/individual/home/2383.html&quot;&gt;Yamakawa&lt;/a&gt; (sold in the States as Raite) DVD/CD/MP3 player. The interesting thing about it is that it's basically constructed from PC components (at it's heart is an ATAPI DVD drive), so that it's (1) inexpensive and (2) programmable in various authorized and unauthorized ways.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/13/auslaender</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;German has word to describe all things foreign that cannot really be translated directly into English. &lt;i&gt;Ausland.&lt;/i&gt; Out of land. Out of space, out of mind, out of time. There, as opposed to here. Someplace else, someplace different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes me, since I'm not German, an &lt;i&gt;Ausl√§nder.&lt;/i&gt; Being German is somethi to which you are born and cannot become (as opposed to being American, which you can become if you stay in the US long enough and watch enough televsion), so as long as I am in Germany I will always be an &lt;i&gt;Ausl√§nder&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not so bad. You pay the same taxes whether you're German or not, and not being able to vote gives me a right to complain about politicians. Despite what some Germans think about themselves, that Germans have something against &lt;i&gt;Ausl√§nder&lt;/i&gt;, I've never felt particularly disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that I don't get any strange reactions. Some people regard an American who can speak German with the same awe as they would regard a talking pig. ('Well, what do you think about that. Now I've seen everything.') Others think that because they've seen so many American movies and heard so much American music, that they know all about me and where I come from, even though they really don't have a clue. (I come from Minnesota, so maybe they need to watch 'Fargo' a few times. America is more complicated that it appears. Uff-da!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, my skin is white, I don't live in a ghetto, and I speak German. (And if I try real hard, I can hide my American accent.) That is, at first glance I'm no different than most Germans. Those &lt;i&gt;Ausl√§nder&lt;/i&gt; who look and sound different have a lot more problems than I. But that has nothing to do with Germans being particularly anti-&lt;i&gt;Ausl√§nder&lt;/i&gt;. That's just plain old ugly racism, something I'm all to familiar with from home. But it's no more or no less ugly in Germany than it is everywhere else. Racism is a human problem and not a particularly German problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pruett &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$287&quot;&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; the freeware program &lt;a href=&quot;http://softwarecenter.net/irfanview/&quot;&gt;Irfanview&lt;/a&gt; to resize graphics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Do you need to be an expert?</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/11/do-you-need-to-be-an-expert/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, I've been searching for a way to make it easy for Mama to copy pictures from our Nikon digital camera to the Internet. Now, Mama's smart, but she isn't a computer expert and she doesn't want to become one. She has better things to do in her spare time. (She doesn't want or need to become a geek... she married one, after all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she wants is to be able to copy JPEG files from a Smart Card (she has a USB drive for the card), reduce the picture size from 1600x1200 to 640 or 350 wide (depending on where she is uploading), then automatically upload the files. That's all she wants to do, and she doesn't want to have to learn (or pay for) PhotoShop or PaintShop or whatever to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her geek husband can do this for her in about 20 lines of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perl.com&quot;&gt;perl&lt;/a&gt;. (&quot;Frontier&quot; can do everything but the picture resizing, I suspect.) That is, if he can be bothered to install perl for her under windows. And since it seems there is no commericial program out there that can do this for her, I guess that's what he'll have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also likes the classic 'Surfin' Bird' because he can sing along. 'Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa Mow-mow, papa-ooma-mow-mow!'&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/08/tel-aviv</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It looks like the world went by without me for a week. Tel Aviv, as the French say...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brdbrain.edithispage.com/2000/07/07&quot;&gt;brdbrain&lt;/a&gt;:  &quot;I need the six-foot-long poster of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfbayquakes.org/northview/north_without_USLett.jpg&quot;&gt;this image&lt;/a&gt; of the Bay. You can get one with the fault lines on it, too! And there's lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfbayquakes.org/thumbnails.html&quot;&gt;views&lt;/a&gt; to choose from.&quot; Looking at the graphic, I could point to the spot in San Jose where I lived until I was 12, over 25 years ago. &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&amp;amp;addr=Partridge+Dr&amp;amp;city=San+Jose&amp;amp;state=CA&amp;amp;slt=37.304800&amp;amp;sln=-121.781300&amp;amp;name=&amp;amp;zip=95121-1009&amp;amp;country=us&amp;amp;BFCat=&amp;amp;BFClient=&amp;amp;mag=9&amp;amp;desc=&amp;amp;cs=9&amp;amp;newmag=7&quot;&gt;Partridge Dr&lt;/a&gt;. Strange how memory gets jolted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother-in-law Ruth also went back to her childhood home this week, for real, not just virtually.It was just the second time in 55 years. She grew up near Schwiebus (now Swiebodzin, Poland), about 50 km east of Frankfurt/Oder. Her parents farm was confiscated after the war and the entire family was moved west. Ruth came all the way west, first to Hamburg and then Schleswig-Holstein, while her family remained in the Soviet Zone near Neuruppin, north of Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruth dropped by unannounced to look at her old family house, but didn't want to knock on the door. The family now there, however, recognized her from her first visit 12 years ago, and invited her in for coffee. The conversation proceeded in a mixture of broken English and German, with the help of an English-Polish dictionary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point the mother of the family disappeared into the attic. She returned with an old photo for Ruth, a family potrait of Ruth as a young girl with her parents and younger sister. They had found it in the house and had kept it all these years.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Difference between Europe and America</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/01/the-difference-between-europe-and-america/"/>
   <updated>2000-07-01T03:07:10+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/07/01/the-difference-between-europe-and-america</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There have lately been a lot of comparisons of Europe and the US in EditThisPage community, including an ongoing series of excellent articles (&lt;a href=&quot;http://surprise.editthispage.com/europe-america&quot;&gt;Europe + America seen with European eyes&lt;/a&gt;) in &quot;Surprise&quot;. Indeed, one could very well devote an entire weblog to the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After nearly 10 years of being an expatriate (expatriatism?), I should certainly have some interesting views on the subject. But maybe I don't. 10 years is a long time, and maybe the strangeness of my adopted culture is no longer strange to me, and my memories of life in the US are so old that they are no longer valid. I don't know. I personally find the &lt;i&gt;similarities&lt;/i&gt; between Europe and America to be more interesting than the differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one has to start someplace. Sorting out a new culture takes time, whether as a tourist, a businessperson, or an emigrant. I had the advantage of being an exchange student in high school, in a culture (Brazil) much more different than where I am now. I had a sense to know what to look for when I came to Europe, and the self-confidence to know I could deal with a new culture, even a German one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can't generalize.&lt;/b&gt;  Simple broad statements are simply not true, and cannot explain the details of your experience in a new culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You have to generalize.&lt;/b&gt; But one has to start someplace. The only way to begin to make sense of a new culture is to start with clich√©s (which usually contain some truth) and compare them to what you are actually experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your point of view is your point of view.&lt;/b&gt; And your point of view starts at home. When you travel, your point of view changes. If you know where you're starting from, you have a better chance of understanding how and why things appear different when you are someplace else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The unexpected will occur unexpectedly.&lt;/b&gt; Make no assumptions. That's easier said than done... at least try to know what your assumptions are. Anything and everything can be different than what you're used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Language is nothing. And everything.&lt;/b&gt; Americans are not used to hearing conversations they don't understand. One can learn and survive in a culture without the language, but learning the language will improve your point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. I haven't even started talking about Europeans and Americans yet. The title for today turned out just to be a come on &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot;. I'll leave the following points open for now. Maybe I'll think of more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Those who left Europe are different from those who stayed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Europe|America] is more complicated that it seems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Christopher Has Taught His Parents in 6 Months</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/2000062604.jpg&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;crh0627.jpg: Christopher not sleeping&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher is 6 months old today. I'm sure in the future we'll celebrate on June 27 as well as on December 27. After all, a 'Sommerfest' is more fun than an afterthought to Christmas. In the meantime, after over 15 years together without children Mama and I have learned an awful lot from our son the past 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making progress is important. The rate of change and learning is amazing to an adult, especially in the first month. Even now, every day brings sometng new. (Progress doesn't have to mean moving forward. Rolling from side to side counts too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laughing a lot is important, even if you do have an ornry period in the late afternoon. Christopher smiles at everything and everyone, although that will pass. He laughs when he gets home from a trip, and smiles at me every evening when I get back from work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toys are important. They have to be colorful, fit well in both hand and mouth, and be either waterproof or absorbant. Two are always better than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covering the basics is important. Eating, sleeping, drinking, filling and changing diapers, washing clothes. Nothing else can happen until the basics are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning and organization are important, but flexibility is even more important. Expect the Unexpected, because the unexpected usually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to know what you want and to communicate it. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, as well as the milk and the clean diaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to catch up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Das Spiel ist aus!&lt;/b&gt; In Euro 2000, Germany lost their final group game to Portugal 3-0 on Tuesday. They finished last in the group with no wins, and have gone home. The last time Germany finished a major tournement without a win was in 1938. As would be expected in a country where arrogance is a national attribute, the media is treating this as a major disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shopping trip&lt;/b&gt; Highlight of the day today was a trip to L√ºneburg to the Baby One shop to look for a crib and a baby phone. We would have bought the crib, they don't deliver, and to fit the crib in the Fiat one of us would have had to stay in L√ºneburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's Official&lt;/b&gt; We'll be flying to the States for three weeks this fall to visit friends and family. We'll be in Arizona Sep 27 to Oct 3, then in Minnesota until Oct 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Euro 2000&lt;/b&gt; The big news first: England 1 Germany 0. The game was fair, hard-fought, entertaining, and could have gone either way, but only confirmed what should have been already clear: neither team is in the top class of European soccer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time England defeated Germany in a tournament was in 1966, the famous World Cup final at Wembley, and the goal that never crossed the line but counted anyway. Germans still remember that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portugal 1 Romania 0. The goal came on a free kick seconds before the final whistle. Until then Portugal had been totally frustrated by the Romanian defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standings: Portugal 6 pts, England 3 pts, Germany and Romania 1 pt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday: France 2 Czech Rep 0, Netherlands 3 Denmark 0. These 4 teams would have been a fair set of semi-finalists. &lt;/p&gt;

Standings: Italy 6 pts, Belgium 3 pts, Turkey and Sweden 1 pt.&lt;br /&gt;
Italy was solid but boring against co-host Belgium. Turkey and Sweden were both equally bad and boring... an utter waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carrot update&lt;/b&gt; Christopher finished the glass he started on &lt;a href=&quot;http://Mama.editthispage.com/2000/06/13&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Carpet and walls in the dining root are still intact. Next week we'll try potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Group C: Norway 1 Spain 0, Yugoslavia 3 Solvenia 3. And I thought this would be the boring group, with Spain rolling over everyone else. Spain gets shut out, and Yugoslavia, down 3-0 with 10 players, score 3 goals within 6 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group A: Portugal 3 England 2. They both looked better than Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Euro 2000 update&lt;/b&gt; Group A: Germany 1 Romania 1. An unsatisfying but fair result. After a total disaster in the first 20 minutes, the Germans were able to equilize and then controlled (without scoring) the final 30 minutes. But Germany did not look like a defending champion. What the draw means for the tournament will, of course, only be clear after Portugal and England play this evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via Dave's Picks &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepage.ntlworld.com/mil.millington/things.html&quot;&gt;Things my girlfriend and I have argued about&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Nothing keeps a relationship on its toes so much as lively debate. Fortunate, then, that my girlfriend and I agree on absolutely nothing. At all.&quot; He's English, she's German. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pentecost holiday weekend&lt;/b&gt;, and we have Monday off. Here in L√ºllau, there is a tradition of 'Pentecost Singers'. On Saturday evening, the young men bring birch trees to each house, and on Sunday morning the boys and girls (in separate groups) sing from house to house. All three groups then expect a gift of schnaps (for the men) or candy (for the kids). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; says &quot;In Hetzwege, the village in which I grew up, the young men also bring Pfingstb√§ume (Pentecost trees) to each house, getting schnaps in return. However, nobody is singing there - unless as a result of being drunk... &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hamburg, Pentecost was celebrated not so traditionally with the Generation Move, a techno parade and party similar to Berlin's Love Parade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mama's Birthday&lt;/b&gt; was yesterday. We had the whole Petersen clan over for a glass of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freixenetusa.com/partyplanner.shtml?number=7&amp;amp;event=Backyard+BBQ&quot;&gt;Freixenet&lt;/a&gt;, afternoon cake &amp;amp; coffee and evening BBQ. The weather was great, so we were able to spend most of time outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Euro 2000&lt;/b&gt; in Belgium and Holland has begun, so for the next three weeks we have soccer on the brain. The first two days were entertaining but there were no upsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group B&lt;br /&gt;
Belgium 2 Sweden 1 : Italy 2 Turkey 1&lt;br /&gt;
The opening match was unexpectedly good, with Belgium taking advantage of lapses in the usually solid Swedish defense. The Turks were robbed. The game winner for Italy came on a penalty that was no foul at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group D&lt;br /&gt;
France 3 Denmark 0 : Netherlands 1 Czech Rep. 0&lt;br /&gt;
The Dutch were very disappointing and deserved to lose, but the Czechs despite many chances couldn't put the ball in the net, and then gave up a stupid penalty in the 89th minute. Christopher and I watched parts of the replay of France-Denmark this afternoon. The score is an overstatement, but France looked strong nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group A, which includes Germany and England, opens play this evening.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to today's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de&quot;&gt;Hamburger Abendblatt&lt;/a&gt;, every 5th wedding in Hamburg is binational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing about the newspapers in Hamburg... the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abendblatt.de&quot;&gt;Abendblatt&lt;/a&gt; is a morning paper, while you can get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mopo.de&quot;&gt;Morgenpost&lt;/a&gt; on the previous evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is the hot topic on EditThisPage today. So what did this American living in Germany eat for breakfast this morning? Ahhh, I overslept and ran out of the house without any breakfast at all. However, I did bring along a strawberry yoghurt and picked up a ham &lt;i&gt;Br√∂tchen&lt;/i&gt; from the delivery service at work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher seems better this morning, but now Mama is having stomach pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update Tuesday evening:&lt;/b&gt; Christopher is doing fine. Mama's running a fever, but I came home from work early so she could get some rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I was in such a rush to get home that I forgot to get gas on the way home. I should have thought of it. When Mama woke up, I decided to drive to the gas station in Jesteburg. I made it just 1,5 km before the tank ran dry. So I walked home, siphoned a liter from Mama into a Coke bottle, and walked back. I still taste gas in my mouth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Music&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite band in high school was the Ramones. Living in rural Minnesota, it wasn't easy to get good music at all, so I was dependent on magazines, mail order, and trips to Minneapolis. So I discovered the Ramones by first reading about them, then ordering Road to Ruin via mail order. In spring of my senior year, we even took a road trip to Minneapolis to see them play at Uncle Sams. We had to sneak in because we were underage. Fond memories.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Christopher has a fever this evening over 38.7 C/101.6 F. We noticed that he was awfully quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First day at the new office today. The technical part of moving went well. The part the moving company was hired to do did not. Our PCs were set up and ready to go, but our keyboards and mice were in our workplace cartons which were not delivered even by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to find my missing Notes server by the end of the afternoon. It was up and running, but plugged into the wrong hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/Astraw3.jpg&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; width=&quot;134&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;astra.jpg: Serviervorschlag - Serving suggestion&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;We are across the street from the Operettenhaus, where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.musical.de/cats/de/html/index.html&quot;&gt;'Cats'&lt;/a&gt; is performed. I can see the 'Cats' eyes from my desk, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hamburger-marktplatz.de/kunden/bavaria/default.htm&quot;&gt;Bavaria-St. Pauli brewery&lt;/a&gt; (local cult brand Astra - Was dagegen?), which BTW has nothing to do with St. Pauli Girl beer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PapaScott (the website) is 6 months old today. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vfth.com&quot;&gt;Al&lt;/a&gt; said yesterday: &quot;When I started this, I had no focus. I still don't. I come here everyday, and do whatever the heck I feel like that day.&quot; I still don't know what I want to do with this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Music&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peppermint-park.com/cultured-pearls/&quot;&gt;Cultured Pearls&lt;/a&gt; are a soul band from Hannover who have had a couple of radio hits, but will probably never break out of Germany (although the albums &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JP11&quot;&gt;&quot;Liquified Days&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000B73Z&quot;&gt;&quot;Space Age Honeymoon&quot;&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the States as imports (apologies for the Amazon links; they aren't listed at BN). Their music is pretty sweet nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Music&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wmf.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Wes&lt;/a&gt; mentions &quot;The Man Who&quot; from Travis, which has apparently just been released in the States. I got this for my birthday in February from my brother-in-law Roland. Mama's comment: &quot;It's not wierd like the other CDs he gives you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If McDonald's can sell Big Macs around the world, why can't record companies manage to release music to both the US and Europe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=5033197093024&quot;&gt;&quot;Reload&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from Tom Jones, his curent collection of duet pop remakes, which (AFAIK) isn't scheduled to be released in the States at all. &quot;Sexbomb&quot; was the big single. but my favorite is &quot;Burning Down the House&quot;: the Tiger shouts, Nina Persson of The Cardigans whispers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt;, here's a good example of the 'Big German Women' clich√©: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stpauligirl.com/main.htm&quot;&gt;St. Pauli Girl&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Germany's Fun Loving Beer&quot; which (AFAIK) is only sold outside of Germany. The girl, in this case, is American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mausnews/mtp.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;Our move at work to Millerntorplatz seems to be proceeding with no problems. I was on call, but nobody called. We had set up a substitute firewall and web server at the new office last week, and they covered the web site during the move. I haven't even been to the new location yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I'm not supposed to print my playlist at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.live365.com/cgi-bin/directory.cgi?genre=search&amp;amp;searchdesc=papascott&amp;amp;autostart=papascott&quot;&gt;PapaScott Radio&lt;/a&gt;, I hope it's OK to give hints...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Music&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading how Brent was reminiscing about The Clash reminded me that I didn't have any CDs at all fro a band that was one of my favorites at the end of high school, when I first heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=74646388525&quot;&gt;&quot;London Calling&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Well, sure enough, buying groceries with Christopher this morning, I was &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot; (actually, it was Marktkauf) and happened upon the CD. Mama saw it when I got home and remarked that I was reverting to my childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a day without &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?ean=731453082724&quot;&gt;The Supremes&lt;/a&gt; is like a day without sunshine...&lt;/p&gt;

Also, to be legal one cannot publish the playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My taste is somewhat Modern Mainstream, half German / half English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using the EasyCast feature at Live365. Just upload the mp3 files and play. I'm ripping the mp3 files at 32 kbps under Linux with gogo and the abcde package from Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our big activity for yesterday was to look for a crib at Dodenhof, a big furniture and department store on the way to Bremen. We decided that the cribs were too expensive, and settled for two pairs of baby socks. We lost one hat, and thought we lost a pacifier until we found it later.  (Our visit was noted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/2000/05/28&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt;. It's a long drive for socks, that's right. &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning we took Christopher to a toddler's church service, even though he still slobbers a lot better than he can crawl or toddle. He seemed to enjoy himself nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://Mama.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Mama&lt;/a&gt; wanted to record Christopher's voice for her website. I've never worked with audio files before; we just plugged a microphone into her sound card and recorded. We got some buzzing in the background, but we were able to upload &lt;a href=&quot;http://Mama.editthispage.com/2000/05/28&quot;&gt;a short wav file and a longer mp3 to her web page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In the last game of the season Hamburg's 2nd League team &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fcstpauli.de/umkleide/main.asp&quot;&gt;FC St. Pauli&lt;/a&gt; scored in the 90th minute to tie and saved themselves from demotion.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our office is moving at the end of the month. Instead of being spread out over 5 floors in two buildings, we'll be together on one floor about 1/2 mile from our present location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll no longer be on the harbor with the view, though. We'll be at the foot of the Reeperbahn, Hamburg's entertainment and red-light district. But it's no cheesy address. We share our new building with Shell Germany and AOL Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're moving the servers on Thursday, June 1, the Ascension holiday (I don't have to help, but I'm on call). We've all been encouraged to take vacation on Friday, June 2, when the movers start. In theory, they will finish and we can start work bright and early on Monday morning, June 5. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in theory, we have a duplicate web server and firewall, and will be able to move with no interruption of web and mail service. We'll see. (Ascension is called 'Himmelfahrt' in German, and a suicide mission is a 'Himmelfahrtskommando'. That's a bad omen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is there's no more free parking. The garage costs over $100 per month. Even though the firm will pay over half, it will still be cheaper to take the train, especially since gas just hit DM 2 per liter again.&lt;/p&gt;

(Only places in the USA are available, I think.)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it out, and our last home in the US, Phoenix, came out on top. Of course, I deliberately manipulated my answers so that it would (desert climate and low taxes very important, ignore education and culture, but national parks are OK).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Familie Berg describes &lt;a href=&quot;http://familieberg.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$213&quot;&gt;Moritz Tagesablauf&lt;/a&gt; (in German), the daily routine for the 8 month old Moritz. This all sounds very familiar (especially the part about changing the diaper when it smells suspicious).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama keeps asking me what her plants are called in English. &lt;a href=&quot;http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/&quot;&gt;Den virtuella floran&lt;/a&gt; is a multilingual botanical database from Sweden. Alas, the text is all in Swedish, but you can look up common names in a number of languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took Christopher just 10 minutes to slide and roll his way the 2 meters from the corner under the teddy bear mobile to just behind Mama's desk. We thought it was pretty cute until he started tugging on Mama's mouse cable.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://partykeller.editthispage.com/2000/05/17&quot;&gt;partykeller&lt;/a&gt; has a nice picture today of the Elbe River in Hamburg. To join in late on a conversation going on there and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://netdyslexia.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;netdyslexia&lt;/a&gt;, I buy my tomato juice in the 1 liter bottles from Becker's Beste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat after me: &quot;When checking an apache installation, I will always check all the directory permissions, going all the way to /&quot;. I just wasted 2 days because someone messed up the / permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/&quot;&gt;inessential&lt;/a&gt; has two stories about Minnesota:  &quot;The slumping Mariners &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnnsi.com/baseball/mlb/news/2000/05/15/twins_mariners_ap/index.html&quot;&gt;beat the Twins&lt;/a&gt; last night 14-0.&quot; and &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/ent/wire/2000/05/16/prince/index.html&quot;&gt;Prince reclaims his name&lt;/a&gt;. At long last.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the magic of time differences and the Internet, I can follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/u/baseball/mlbcom/audio/game.htm&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt; of the last inning of the Twins game in Seattle before going to work this morning. Hey, the Twins even scored a run, not that at losing 9-5 it made much difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I would have been better off being born a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cubs.com&quot;&gt;Cubs&lt;/a&gt; fan, like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cuwu.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;Curmudgoen&lt;/a&gt;. (Then again, maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.latimes.com/news/20000517/bbo/los/20000517fuou8tke.html&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/05/14/germany.state.election.ap/index.html&quot;&gt;State elections in NRW&lt;/a&gt; today, down where Andrea and Andr√© live. Unlike February's election in Schleswig-Holstein, which all 4 national parties could claim at least a small victory, in today all parties except the Free Democrats were clear losers. (The CDU's somewhat racist slogan 'Kinder statt nder' ('Children instead of Indians') against the 'green card' program for computer specialists was thankfully a flop, I guess since neither children nor Indians could vote.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to understand Europe needs to first understand the annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurosong2000.com/&quot;&gt;Eurovision Song Contest&lt;/a&gt; (warning: this website reaches out and bites your browser), held last night in Stockholm. It's hokey, it's kitschy, it's lowest common denominator entertainment, even more so now that the TV audience throughout Europe can call in and vote. We missed it, though. I hear Denmark won, and that Germany's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www3.alphamusic.com/cgi-bin/alphamusic.storefront/1013185312/Product/View/0743217305925&quot;&gt;Stefan Raab&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.alphamusic.com/cgi-bin/rm.pl?http://212.86.33.115:8080/pressezhl/925/305/ZXOPYLEACBKGZMHLARGHLXAECGHW.rm&quot;&gt;Wadda hadda dudde da&lt;/a&gt; (30 s Real Player sample) came in 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another step on the road to European Zen would the the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euro2000.org/&quot;&gt;UEFA European Football Championships&lt;/a&gt;. That's coming up next month in Holland and Belgium. Germany will be lucky to do as well here as Stefan Raab did in Stockholm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Mama and I have some learning to about children's books from the other's country. We're trying to already estalish a going-to-bed routine for Christopher with 15 minutes of reading. Yesterday Mama tried reading English nursery rhymes... but, of course, they're all new to her, and she doesn't know the tunes. (This evening I cheated...

&lt;p&gt;Lots of new pictures at PhotoPoint: &lt;a href=&quot;http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&amp;amp;a=5038363&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&amp;amp;a=5039996&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&amp;amp;a=5040043&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&amp;amp;a=5038348&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, count 'em, 4 albums!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cows are back! Our neighbor Achim brought out his Charolais cattle yesterday. Their first stop is the pasture past the horse shed behind our house. They'll stay about a week before they move on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Easter Bonfire, on the night before Easter, is the big event of the year in L√ºllau. It's organized by the volunteer fire department. They gather the wood, set the fire and sell bratwurst, beer and schnaps. I'd say 300 people were there last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Most of the little towns in this area have bonfires for Easter, but it doesn't seem to be a universal German tradition. Mama had never heard of it when she was growing up.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher started expressing displeasure at 9pm, so we went home earlier than we had planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Christopher just waking up this morning. (April 23: Christopher says, &quot;Thanks for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/04/23&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, Dave. I'll take that as a compliment!&quot;) Points of note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's wearing his Oshkosh locomotive pyjamas, from John and Diane
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's kicked the covers off, as usual
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's not smiling, because he sees the camera
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He's lying crooked, with feet slightly to the left. He`d turn completely to the left if he could.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be thankful that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digiscents.com&quot;&gt;DigiScents&lt;/a&gt; is not activated for this page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://Mama.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Mama&lt;/a&gt; has a picture of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://Mama.editthispage.com/2000/04/19&quot;&gt;complete left turn&lt;/a&gt;. He just slides under the side of the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My folks are flying back to Minnesota from Hamburg this afternoon. That means we'll slowly get back into the swing of things here at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher was apparently quite accustomed to the constant attention from Grandma and Grandpa. When he got home with Mama this evening, he would smile when Mama was next to him, but would start crying as soon as she walked away. Is this the end of our low-maintenance self-entertaining baby?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it was back to work. But now with the Easter and May Day German holidays coming up, we have 4-day work weeks for the next three weeks. I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My folks are still here, midway through their two-week visit. Updates are sporadic here, and Mama just declared a vacation to avoid updates at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major achievement: my father and I brought power to our carport, burying about 5 m of cable. We now have lights and sockets in both the carport and the shed. My father says that all the electrical parts look different than he is used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave and Luke have been talking about ISPs and the &quot;local loop&quot;. My employer has had good experience with our T1 (or whatever the European equivalent is called). Our downtime is maybe 5 or 10 minutes per week. Our local loop is not from Deutsche Telekom, but from HanseNet, which like our ISP is a subsidiary of the local power utility HEW.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the summer, they twisted the field 90 degrees so that the old end zone seats moved to midfield. This week they are starting on the roof fabric... several weeks behind schedule.

&lt;p&gt;He's starting to have some loud crying phases. Our first few weeks of the quiet baby with no problems to speak of were indeed too good to be true. Is he teething? Maybe... anyway, he and Mama are exhausted this evening. She won't be flipping her home page today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we're getting ready for my folks to visit their new grandson for 2 1/2 weeks starting on Friday. We're having Christopher baptized this Sunday, and otherwise we have no fixed plans for their stay. We can't make any big trips... niether of our cars can accomodate 4 adults and a child seat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the usual story. It's the weekend, and Christopher is in a much better mood than either of us. It's 8:30am, he's just had breakfast, and he's babbling and gurgling happily at his Fisher Price Teddy Bear mobile. &lt;/p&gt;

When he's especially pleased, he goes into a 'full body smile', in which he throws back his head, waves his arms, and kicks up his legs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's always slept well during the night, 4 hours at a stretch, but the last two nights he's slept through from 11pm to 5am. We're hoping that's a new trend.&lt;/p&gt;

CNNSI: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnnsi.com/soccer/world/news/2000/03/11/german_roundup_ap/&quot;&gt;Munich impressive without Matthaeus&lt;/a&gt;:  &quot;Third-place Hamburger SV stalled after losing 2-1 to Ulm, but  didn't lose much ground as the other candidates for a Champions Cup qualifying berth failed to win.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ever since we've had a little hippo of our own in the house, we've taken more notice of hippo products in the marketplace. Here are a couple of examples that Mama could not resist. I imagine that the Happy Hippo Snack is a chocolate covered something. And as for the shower curtain, we needed a new one anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update Nov 2003&lt;/b&gt; Since people keep asking, we bought the shower curtain at the German home improvement chain Obi.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hope either McCain or Bradley stays in the race. I have to pay big bucks for postage to send in an absentee ballot, but Gore vs Bush is not worth the bother of licking the stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a tough weekend. Our neighbor Walter turned 70 on Saturday, with dinner and coffee starting at 11 am at the fire hall in L√ºllau. And the schnaps started flowing before noon. Then on Sunday we had a combined February birthday for me, Mama's brother and his 5-year-old daughter. Highlight was hearing her sing along to the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomjones.com&quot;&gt;Tom Jones&lt;/a&gt; single: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.v2music.com/Scripts/WebObjects-ISAPI.dll/V2_New_Publisher.woa/74892000002661200000629520000025733/TomJonesReleaseIndex.wo/018020000006733/0.3.0/1/Webobjects1&quot;&gt;Sex Bomb&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher came through the weekend in much better shape than Mama and I!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/03/05&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;:  &quot;Cafe Boronne in Menlo Park is a European type hangout place smack in the middle of Silicon Valley.&quot; But the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$448&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; doesn't look like any hangout I've seen in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've become jaded. For me, a European cafe is a tiny &amp;lt;A HREF=http://www.tchibo.dTchibo coffee counter. You see them on every corner, and they all look alike. No place to sit... no chairs at all. Stay standing, drink your coffee in 5 minutes (no food served) and leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you folow the link, you'll see Tchibo looks more like a fashion catalog than a coffee company. They make more profit at their coffee shops from clothes than from coffee, since the discount store &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aldi.de&quot;&gt;Aldi&lt;/a&gt; has ruined the coffee market. Tchibo mentions coffee on their web page only as an afterthought.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortune: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fortune.com/fortune/2000/03/06/ste.html&quot;&gt;Hard Times: A Letter from 2035&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org&quot;&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNNSI &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnnsi.com/soccer/world/news/2000/03/03/german_roundup_ap/&quot;&gt;Hamburg held to 4-4 draw&lt;/a&gt; (they blew1 lead in Wolfsburg), but &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnnsi.com/soccer/world/news/2000/03/04/german_roundup/&quot;&gt;Bayern falls in Matth√§us' Bundesliga goodbye&lt;/a&gt;. Lothar Matth√§us is leaving Munich to play in the US for the MetroStars. He enjoys the sound of his own voice. Fans in New York should be glad that he can't speak English yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via &lt;a href=&quot;http://cuwu.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;curmudgeon&lt;/a&gt;:  &quot;Are Europeans more mature than Americans? In an exchange between Kate Adams (&quot;brdbrain&quot;) and Andrea Frick (&quot;andrea&quot;), Kate mentioned that Europeans are more mature, and Andrea thought that was strange.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was that Europeans are forced to make more choices younger than Americans do. Mama, like all Germans, started to specialize her schooling already in the 5th or 6th grade. I didn't start to specialize until my 3rd year of college. &lt;i&gt;Of course, both our careers today are nothing like we could have imagined back then!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curmudgeon said: &quot; It is funny, but I, too, assume Europeans are more mature. Maybe it's because European kids are allowed more freedom as they grow up. Schools in the US spend a lot of effort on &quot;controlling&quot; students.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Funny, I said forced to choose, he said free to choose. Same difference?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I find the similarities between Germans and Americans much more interesting than the differences!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for our half-American, half-European son, he's just 10 weeks old, but he seems as mature as at least 12 weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mama and Christopher are visiting Oma (Grandma) Ruth in Eckernf√∂rde for the rest of the week. It's Christopher's first road trip. (But don't expect any updates on her home page for the next few days... I doubt if she has time to stop by the Internet caf√©.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the top news story in Germnay today. MS&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/375933.asp&quot;&gt;Germans hold U.S. teens over deaths&lt;/a&gt;:  &quot;Prosecutors asked for murder charges Tuesday against three U.S. teenagers accused of tossing rocks from a highway bridge at passing cars, killing two drivers&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media here is not making a big deal that the teenagers are American. There have been a dozen similar incidents in the past 10 years involving German youth causing injury or death to drivers by throwing objects from bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to write something about Amazon's patent last night, but instead I told &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$113&quot;&gt;Andrea&lt;/a&gt; about how at the beginning of our relationship Mama and I stayed in touch from separate contintents, before there was an Internet, or even cheap international phone calls. (Actually, I just wanted her to tell her story of how she and Andr√© &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrea.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$117&quot;&gt;met via the Internet&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been fiddling with my ISDN connection at home, trying to get it to work with FreeBSD, so I've been mostly offline the past couple of days. I did give Mama my spare ISDN card, though, so she could stay online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German income tax is like US income tax back in the '70s. Very complicated and very expensive. Lots of rules and lots of deductions. The fifty-percent tax bracket is alive and well. However, my experience is that, unlike the American IRS, the German Finanzamt is staffed by living, feeling human beings. It's a local office rather than a faceless national bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to break out the baby pictures... I need hits for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editthispage.com/Top100&quot;&gt;Top 100&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About to replace me in the Top 10, and much more deserving, is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://popo.editthispage.com/&quot;&gt;discussion section&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popo.at/&quot;&gt;popo.at&lt;/a&gt;, an Austrian site with politcial reaction to their new government. popo stands for &quot;politcal potential&quot;. &lt;i&gt;Move your popo and your ass will follow!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

My Twingo is in the shop today for planned service. So I'm driving a big Megane station wagon today. &lt;i&gt;Before we became parents, we used to call station wagons 'Pampers Bombers'.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furnace update: It turns out it had overheated yesterday, and the plumber only needed to push the reset button (marked 'For Technician Use Only'). He didn't find anything else wrong. &lt;i&gt;Is this something like Ctrl-Alt-Delete?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Actually, it was the first or second weekend in February 1980, which would be the 3rd or the 10th. But Valentine's Day is easier to remember.) It was a gathering of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afs.org&quot;&gt;AFS&lt;/a&gt; exchange students. I had just returned from Brazil, she was spending a year in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;http://Mama.editthispage.com&quot;&gt;Mama&lt;/a&gt; is starting to gain self-confidence. She mailed me at work:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suggestion to Userland: How about reserving the domain 'edithispage.com' (with only one t). That's how I always mistype it. &quot;;-&amp;gt;&quot; &lt;i&gt;Edit His Page? Isn't that sexist?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After it was too wet last weekend to work on our &lt;a href=&quot;/2000/01/29&quot;&gt;mole/gopher problem&lt;/a&gt;, we were finally able to take action today. We opened up all the molehills, squirted in the mole repellent (which has an odor like concentrated hog manure), and then trampled down the hills. The ground was so wet, I'm sure the moles and gophers had already drowned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates took time off from Davos to appear Saturday evening on Wetten Dass, a talk/game show that is the highest rated German TV show. He looked &lt;a href=&quot;http://212.227.136.156/slideshow/2/full/7.jpg&quot;&gt; uncomfortable&lt;/a&gt; between Naomi Campbell and &lt;a href=&quot;http://212.227.136.156/slideshow/1/full/2.jpg&quot;&gt;Pamela Anderson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The ZDF network is a partner of Microsoft.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the big stormstorm that hit the US East Coast earlier this week has now reached us as rain with heavy winds. Yech! Flooding is forecast for this evening for the North Sea coast and Hamburg harbor (including my office).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came home Friday evening to find Grandma Ruth had gone home, and that both Mama and Christopher were tired (and just a little bit cranky). I sent them both to bed. It seems Mama misses out on her afternoon nap when Grandma visits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how old you get, there's nothing like being with your parents to make you feel childish again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work I've been setting up a test apache server running under &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebsd.org&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;. It's actually quite nice to work with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in 10 years, the dollar costs more than 2 DM. Expressed in modern terms, &lt;a href=&quot;http://uk.news.yahoo.com/000128/5/dzad.html&quot;&gt;the Euro&lt;/a&gt; since yesterday costs less than a dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm typing this bit with the new Mozilla M13 under Linux.

&lt;p&gt;We're starting to notice advances in Christopher's development. He now seems able to focus on the colored blocks we hung over his cradle. He's gaining control of his arms and hands, although they aren't quite coordinated yet. And he's started smiling (really smiling, not just the instinctive grin when he's just finished eating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandma Ruth is coming again tomorrow for a couple days. Grandma Shirley and Grandpa Marlyn have their plane tickets for the end of March. It looks like we'll have the baptism on 2 April in Jesteburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've gotten a lot of compliments on Christopher's sweater. It was knitted by Aunt Kirsten for her son Jakob, and we have it on loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John VanDyk, &lt;a href=&quot;http://vfih.editthispage.com/2000/01/23&quot;&gt;Those dumb farmers&lt;/a&gt;: In school, you had the townies and the farm kids. The townies may have had the edge when it came to spelling or math, but the farm kids had the claim to practicality....on the whole, the farm kids had more common sense. &lt;i&gt;Sounds like where I grew up. I was a town kid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher's big test today was a visit to Mama's office. It sounds like he won them all over. But as I came home from work, she was on the phone with one of her colleagues talking company politics. &lt;i&gt;Her heart's at home, but her head's still in it!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher felt right at home at the party last night. We stayed over an hour. When we got home, Mama and I were went straight to bed, but Christopher was ready for more! (Note for our to-do list: teach Christopher the difference between day and night.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher is going to his first party this evening. Anke from work moved out of the city to the country near us last November, and is having a combination birthday/housewarming party. Mama said that Christopher travelled so well yesterday (visiting and shopping), that we could put in a brief appearance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting today, we have something at home that folks in the US take for granted: flatrate Internet access. Up to now we've always had to pay for the local phone call, 3 to 6 pfennigs per minute. Now there are flatrates available nationwide for around DM 150 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing an ultimatum from his Christian Democratic party to reveal the sources of illegal campaign contributions he personally accepted, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl chose instead to resign as honorary party chairman. He was party leader for over 25 years, until last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27 minutes of the 30 minute evening news on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdf.msnbc.de&quot;&gt;ZDF&lt;/a&gt; were devoted to the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Germany's Watergate, and it's not over yet. The main difference is that it wasn't brought to light until after the Chief Executive was voted out of office.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We just called Grandma at home in Minnesota to wish her a happy birthday, but I thought we'd repeat the wish here for all to see! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cats have been complaining that Christopher has been getting too much face time on this website. In order to keep peace in the household, here they are. We've had all three for over 10 years now, since we were in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/mausi0117.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;mausi0117.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is Mausi, the oldest and smallest. He's too sophisticated to have anything to do with the baby or the other cats. Here he's alone in our bedroom when everyone else is downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/helga0117.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;helga0117.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is Helga, our streetwise tabby cat. She likes adults, but stays away from children. She's taken the longest to acknowledge the baby, although she's gotten pretty close here. (And, yes, that's a stuffed version of the Maus Newsletter mascot behind her.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/karlheinz0117.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;karlheinz0117.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is Karl-Heinz, Mama's favorite. He's accepted Christopher, if only to stay close to her. This is a typical pose, sleeping obscenely on his back.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I stayed up late to watch the Vikings play St. Louis. The DSF German sports channel shows NFL games at 11:30pm Sunday evenings. They are delayed by a couple of hours but most of the commerical breaks are cut. So it only took me 1&amp;nbsp;1/4 hours of real time to give up on the Vikings (I went to bed at 42-17 in the 4th quarter).&lt;/p&gt;

Mama has insisted on equal time. Here is her baby picture at age 10 days to show that Christopher has some resemblence to her as well. She also wants to point out that in June 1963 the punk hairstyle was quite futuristic. (More of her baby pics are &lt;a href=&quot;http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=185392&amp;amp;a=1529487&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking several days off after returning from the hospital, Mama is again writing for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mausnews.de&quot;&gt;Maus Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in German. Today she started her childbirth report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to hold a baby and type at the computer simultaneously. Is there such a thing as a keyboard that can be used with one hand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oma is here for her first visit of Christopher. We have a couple of pictures in the Week 3 album at &lt;a href=&quot;http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumList?u=185392&quot;&gt;Photopoint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've started calling Christopher our &quot;Nilpferd&quot; (Hippopatomus, but it sounds better in German) because of all the interesting sounds he makes. The grunts, snorts and wheezes sound mostly happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just thought i can drop you a quick note while you're at work. mom and i got a good start today. got out of bed at 8:30 and i dedcided to nap a little more in my basket. that way she could take a shower, dress and have breakfast before me. yes, i can be a pretty considerate kind of guy. now that i'm all set, she said we'll dress warm and drive to the post ofice for stamps and to minimal for some nursing type of groceries. sounds like a fun trip to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have a good day,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;christopher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ps.: can you do that fliegergriff routine again tonite? i really liked&lt;br /&gt;
it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúFliegergriff‚Äù is a grip the midwife showed us. It looks something like this:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Reflections on childbirth</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/01/09/reflections-on-childbirth/"/>
   <updated>2000-01-09T03:01:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/01/09/reflections-on-childbirth</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An article in progress&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the moment that Christopher was given to my wife, time seemed to stand still. I'm sure that there must have been a lot of activity in the delivery room, after the cord was cut, the placenta was expelled and examined, and the episiotomy was sewn shut. I don't remember much of that. I just remember holding as best I could my wife and Christopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't really compare childbirth in the US and in Germany, of course. We were loaned one American book (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380780399/qid=947419090/sr=1-1/104-9658493-2473257&quot;&gt;Pregnancy and Childbirth&lt;/a&gt; by Tracie Hotchner), which was helpful for vocabulary but seemed very paranoid and depressed. My feeling about many passages in the book was &quot;I'm glad we're giving birth in Germany so we don't have to go through that!&quot; (Looking at Amazon, I see the reviews there are mixed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said in my first article that the PDA turned the birth into a clinical experience, but that isn't 100% true. I didn't have change into greens, and I don't remember anyone wearing masks, even during the delivery. When the PDA had set in, the midwife encouraged me to get into the bed with my wife and catch a few winks; the lights were turned down low and we were left alone. We never had to change rooms, and the delivery room did have a couple of padded chairs and a radio/cassette player so it didn't feel quite so shiny and sterile as a hospital room might feel. (We had recorded a couple of cassettes for the labor, but we never thought to put them in. We heard some Top 40 station all night long.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany, a midwife is required to attend to every birth, and our midwife Vera was one of the best. We didn't choose her; she was simply on duty that night, but my wife knew her from the weekly acupuncture treatments. All the midwives we have met during the past 2 months seem to possess a kind of magic in their voices and in their hands. It might well be witchcraft, in the most positive sense of the word. Vera's encouragement and sense of what my wife was feeling might very well have made the difference that made a C-section unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife's health insurance entitled her to be treated by the head physician of the department...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I never did finish this story.  I guess I would have written about how our private health insurance entitled us to better care than the normal German couple would have recieved. This story from my old weblog was copied into Movable Type on 17 August 2003&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>He's now official</title>

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/2000/01/07/hes-now-official</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We finally took the baby carriage out for a spin this afternoon. Of course, I left the camera inside, but here you can see Christopher all bundled up for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/crh0107.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;crh0107.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have Christopher's papers, we can start our tour of German bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our local city hall, I registered Christopher's official residence and had a exemption added to my income tax card. I also changed my tax status from secondary earner to main earner, since Mama is on maternity leave this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first eight weeks of maternity leave are paid, and the unpaid leave can last until the child turns 3, during which the mother and father can alternate. As part of maternity leave, Mama receives a 'Child Rearing Payment' of DM 600 for 6 months.  Low income families receive this for 2 years. The application is more complicated than a tax return!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the federal labor ministry, we will receive a monthly 'Kindergeld' until Christropher is at least 18, even longer if he studies or learns a trade. The SPD/Green government just increased the Kindergeld by DM 20 to DM 270 per month (about $140).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the social security office comes a one-time 'Maternity Payment' of DM 400 as a supplement to the paid maternity leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least it's cheap: DM 24, or $15. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usconsulate.de&quot;&gt;US Consulate&lt;/a&gt; wants $40 to register the birth to an American citizen abroad, and then another $40 for a child's passport.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my dad, the highway engineer, here's a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.userland.com/cluetrain/picture$13&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.userland.com/cluetrain/clues&quot;&gt;cluetrain&lt;/a&gt; website. (Mama says that the picture is too gross to include here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying to find a good picture to include with our birth announcements. I thought this one would be OK, but after printing it out, I see it looks like he's been playing with yellow hi-liters with both hands!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/crh0105.jpg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;crh0105.jpg: &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice thing about having babies in Germany is that a midwife makes a few house calls after mother and child are at home to make sure everything is going OK. Our midwife Jenny was here for the second time this afternoon, and it seems that all three us of are doing alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, after complaining at 3am that I couldn't start a new home page for today, I went back to bed and slept until 9:30, when Mama finally woke the two of us up. Just goes to show, there's no problem that a little sleep can't solve!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher and I were sleeping at 4 am, and Mama was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're preparing birth announcements with picture for the German relatives, since it's the kind of thing that's expected over here. We couldn't think of anything appropriately funny (my brother-in-law announced his first son with &quot;The center of the universe weighs xxx grams, is xxx cm long, and is in bad mood at the moment&quot;; we can't compete with that.) We took the plageristic route, stealing two quotes from a German baby &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.babyzimmer.de&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and combined them into one. Translation: &quot;Already in our hearts, now also in our arms. On 27 December at 3:39 am the happiness in our lives became complete.&quot; &lt;i&gt;True, but sappy!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher came about 4 pm today. We're using the basket from the baby carriage as his first bed. We can then carry him up or down the stairs to whatever room we're in. In this picture he's under the Christmas tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at Christopher, I have the feeling I am looking in a mirror. To confirm the resemblence, here is a picture of me from  February 1962 (scanned Polaroid b&amp;amp;w snapshot) and of Christopher from his first day (digital photo converted to b&amp;amp;w)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got a nice New Year's present from the German government today... a gas tax increase of 7 Pf went into effect, and the oil companies were kind enough to add 4 Pf of their own. I filled up for DM 1,90 today. That's over a dollar per liter... over $4 per gallon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I celebrated the new millenium at Mama's bedside at the hospital. She came down with a fever at 11pm, so we couldn't even drink the champange I had smuggled in. All we could do at midnight was smile and kiss. Christopher slept through it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher's jaundice had gone down, so he was in the room with us, not under the UV lights. Nursing went well today, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have a real name for this website! We've been calling each other 'PapaScott' and 'MamaMaus' for several months now, so it seems to fit. I hope the font for the logo isn't &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; dignified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother asked why vacuum babies are more prone to high bilirubin. The nurse explained that the bruising caused by the vacuum is stress on circulation and hence on the liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I found a better place to keep baby pictures at &lt;a href=&quot;http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumList?u=185392&quot;&gt;PhotoPoint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It took me a long time to start writing this story. Participating in the birth was more difficult psychologically than I ever imagined. I saw my wife suffering so badly at a fairly early stage of labor, and I knew the pain would only get worse before it would get better. I had no idea how to comfort her, much less how to deal with it myself!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Mama due on the 27th, we made sure not to make any fixed plans&lt;br /&gt;
over the holidays. At least, I thought we made sure. My wife forgot,&lt;br /&gt;
and invited her mother to stay overnight from the 25th to the&lt;br /&gt;
26th. &quot;But we might have to suddenly leave for the clinic,&quot; my wife explained to her mother. &quot;So you might have to find your own way to the train&lt;br /&gt;
station.&quot; But she didn't really believe that anything would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sure enough, my wife woke up at midnight feeling uncomfortable, and&lt;br /&gt;
started feeling contractions at 3 am. She didn't wake me up until 6&lt;br /&gt;
am, since the contractions were weak and 20 minutes apart. We knew&lt;br /&gt;
that things wouldn't be serious until they were 5 minutes apart or the&lt;br /&gt;
water broke, so we weren't yet too concerned. We went ahead with our&lt;br /&gt;
Christmas dinner plans, roasted goose legs from Poland, with red&lt;br /&gt;
cabbage and potatoes. After all , the goose legs were already thawed&lt;br /&gt;
out, and had to be cooked that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just as the goose legs came out of the oven, the water&lt;br /&gt;
broke. It didn't come rushing out, though, and the contractions were&lt;br /&gt;
still 15 minutes apart and fairly weak. My wife called her midwife, who&lt;br /&gt;
said not to be concerned yet as long as she was feeling well. We&lt;br /&gt;
went ahead with dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after dinner, at 2:30 pm, the water started flowing more&lt;br /&gt;
strongly, and my wife was not feeling good any longer. &quot;We are going to&lt;br /&gt;
the hospital... NOW.&quot; So we did, and my mother-in-law had to find her&lt;br /&gt;
own way to the train station after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had started to snow (northern Germany was catching the edge of the&lt;br /&gt;
big storm that caused so much damage in France), so driving to the&lt;br /&gt;
hospital was pretty slow. At the hospital, they attached a CTG (fetal&lt;br /&gt;
heart monitor) for 30 minutes (contractions now 8 minutes apart),&lt;br /&gt;
performed an ultrasound, told us we had a ways to go yet and that the&lt;br /&gt;
size of the baby could cause difficulties, and had us fill out&lt;br /&gt;
paperwork, move into a room, and come back in a couple of hours, at&lt;br /&gt;
7:30. Then it was back on the CTG. The contractions were now 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
apart and getting uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then moved into a delivery prep area, where in theory my wife could&lt;br /&gt;
relax and take a bath, which would make the contractions more&lt;br /&gt;
comfortable. In fact, they became totally unbearable, in every&lt;br /&gt;
position, and in the bath they felt worse. The cervix was only dilated&lt;br /&gt;
3 cm... it needs to be 10 cm to deliver, so things would only get&lt;br /&gt;
worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hadn't really discussed pain medication beforehand, except that&lt;br /&gt;
we'd try to get by without if we could. Obviously, at this point all&lt;br /&gt;
bets were off, and she requested a PDA... anesthetic injected near&lt;br /&gt;
the spinal cord, the strongest type of pain medication available for&lt;br /&gt;
normal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the PDA meant the birth became a very clinical procedure. It&lt;br /&gt;
was applied by an anesthetist, an IV was needed to regulate blood&lt;br /&gt;
pressure, a CGT was then permanently attached, and labor-inducing&lt;br /&gt;
medication were administered to keep the contractions going. We even had&lt;br /&gt;
to sign a release between contractions, but by 11 pm the PDA was in&lt;br /&gt;
place, and my wife was in peace. The PDA would last for 2 hours...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, anyway. In fact, the pains returned after only an&lt;br /&gt;
hour. Even worse, the anesthetist was no longer available to reapply&lt;br /&gt;
the PDA (that snowstorm had caused a number of accidents)... only at&lt;br /&gt;
1:30 am did someone arrive to refill the anesthetic. If they hadn't&lt;br /&gt;
arrived, a Cesarean section would have been unavoidable, as my wife had&lt;br /&gt;
no strength left at all, and her cervix was only at 8 cm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the second PDA, though, she was able to even sleep for about&lt;br /&gt;
an hour and the cervix was able to dilate fully before she had to start pressing. However, the size of the baby was causing problems. The head was just too large to pass into the birth canal. The doctor was signalling that they could start a Cesarean, but the midwife insisted that my wife was making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The midwife was right. At 3:15, the head was far enough down so that a&lt;br /&gt;
vacuum extractor (an alternative to forceps commonly used in Europe)&lt;br /&gt;
could be used to complete delivery. One doctor pounded on my wife's&lt;br /&gt;
stomach, the other pulled on the extractor, and at 3:39 am Christopher, all wet and sloppy, was laying on her stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tough day today for the new mother and son. Are the baby blues setting in already? Or are we as new parents just unsure of ourselves? Is nursing really supposed to be such a struggle? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a couple of days before I was ready to write a story about &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$50&quot;&gt;Birthing Christopher&lt;/a&gt;. Participating in the birth as a father is very psychologically draining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a new round of Christopher pictures at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofoto.com/i.cfm?m=864301102&amp;amp;n=3490345&quot;&gt;Ofoto&lt;/a&gt; (registration required). I'm still learning how to use the digital camera. I don't feel comfortable using flash in the hospital, but in low light without flash, some pictures are very blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evening we learned that Christopher has a high bilirubin count, meaning he has newborn jaundice. It's not a serious condition, and not uncommon (especially for vacuum extracted babies), but means he needs to spend at least a day separated from us in an incubator under ultraviolet lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means Mama's hospital stay will be prolonged by a couple of days, so we'll be ringing in the new millenium together in her room at AK Harburg. I'll smuggle in a bottle of champagne for the two of us.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For grandparents and other hardcore Christopher fans, we have set up photo albums (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofoto.com/i.cfm?m=938240102&amp;amp;n=2454059&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofoto.com/i.cfm?m=785480102&amp;amp;n=4898694&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt;) at Ofoto.com (they'll ask you to register first, and they only ship prints to US addresses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a suitable subject, I'm looking for the best way to share masses of digital photos. But Ofoto looks like a good first step, although they are a bit commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, I posted an &lt;a href=&quot;http://x26.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=565792464&amp;amp;CONTEXT=946469562.1825701899&amp;amp;hitnum=0&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; for Christopher on the Debian GNU/Linux developer's mailing list: &quot;crh is the initial version of a program that will eventually revolutionize the entire world. The functionality of this initial version is restricted to simple input (mother's milk) and output (dirty diapers).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/24/christmas-eve</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course it rained yesterday, so no white Christmas here. All the snow from last weekend was washed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plans for the day are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit our neighbors across the road and next door &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Church service at 3:00pm in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jesteburg.de&quot;&gt;Jesteburg&lt;/a&gt; to watch the neighbor girl in the children's choir &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raclette-suisse.ch/english/&quot;&gt;raclette&lt;/a&gt; for the two of us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call my parents in Minnesota after 10:00pm (3:00pm their time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(All plans subject to impending labor pains, of course, since Mama is due in 3 days.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jesteburg.de&quot;&gt;Jesteburg&lt;/a&gt; web site is in German, but there's a nice picture of the Niedersachsen Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;raclette&quot;&gt;Raclette:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I never knew that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raclette-suisse.ch/english/&quot;&gt;raclette&lt;/a&gt; web site existed... here's their recipe (but we're being cheap and are using Gouda cheese instead of the real stuff)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authentic Raclette: The traditional recipe (for 4 people)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;800 g Swiss Raclette cheese in slices&lt;br /&gt;
1 kg Raclette potatoes (small, even-sized potatoes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usual trimmings: gherkins, silverskin onions, mixed pickles, freshly milled pepper, paprika&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing and serving Swiss Raclette&lt;br /&gt;
Boil the potatoes in ther jackets. Line a basket or bowl with a napkin. Place cooked potatoes in basket and cover with napkin to keep them warm. Cut the Swiss Raclette cheese into pan-sized slices and arrange them on a dish. Place gherkins, onions and other trimmings in bowls and place with a pepper mill and paprika on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alpine farmers would place a half wheel of raclette cheese in front of a glowing fire and scrape the melted cheese directly onto steaming boiled potatoes or a piece of bread. Today, with the modern raclette oven, the preparation of raclette is one of the easiest meals to prepare. The raclette oven with individual grill pans is ideal for general home use. Raclette can also be prepared in the microwave or under the grill in a traditional oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the view from our living room this morning. Our backyard only extends to the fence; the horse pasture isn't ours, it's just part of our view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to have caught a cold, and I have a pounding headache. I'm glad I didn't have to go outside for these pictures! Even zooming in on the horses through the window seems to have worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even my PC seems to be under the weather. My 128 MB RAM chip sputtered out around 12:30 am Saturday morning, so I only have 64 MB left. It's feeling somewhat underpowered, even just using Netscape under Linux starts swapping to disk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T minus 12 days and counting. Mama has been taking acupuncture, drinking raspberry-leaf tea, breathing rose oil, going in for lymph drainage, swallowing tiny homeopathic sugar balls. Her doctor says the baby will be at least 4 kilos. (The cat, Karl-Heinz, is over 7 kilos, by the way.) I wanted to take a picture of her bare foot, but she hid it in time... you can barely see a toe behind her sock. (&lt;i&gt;Oh no! She has discovered the &quot;Discuss&quot; page and has posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$22&quot;&gt;a response&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using Gphoto and the Gimp under Linux to prepare these pictures. Gphoto was easier to get working than was the included software for Windows on Mama's computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VA Linux finally confirmed... I'm in! db alex.brown never did find my original paperwork, but let me fax it in again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama's boss gave her a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0590353403/mausnewsletter05&quot;&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; book for Christmas. Not exactly what you'd expect from a management type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mama is looking at me instead of out the window at the neighbor's horse shed in back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my urging, my parents in Minnesota got a computer a couple of weeks ago and are now nearly in the Internet... they can browse web pages, but can't yet send and receive mail. That reminds me how hard the Internet still is, despite the attempts to make it easy. I'm sure their provider gives their new customers all the technical data that is needed to sign on, but that certainly doesn't mean that a beginner can figure what do to if (or when) something goes wrong. All we want to do is to be able to send them baby pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mom and Dad: That's Curly from the Three Stooges in the left margin. He knows how it feels to be connecting to the Internet for the first time. Just click on his face! (and make sure your sound is turned on.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Christmas cards....</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For once we are preparing our Christmas cards early... here's Mama hard at work! (And, yes, that's a Tux Linux mascot behind her, even though she's strictly a Windows woman.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/fppaper.jpg&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;fppaper.jpg: She's checking her list...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems I've caught the attention of &quot;Scripting News&quot;. Sorry, Dave, but when I put Curly in my template, Mama just had to play the wav file 30 times in a row. I hope she didn't break anything! (In preparation for the oncoming onslaught of visitors from Scripting News, I'm updating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://shanson.editthispage.com/faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our only big plan for the weekend is to go see the new James Bond film, which just opened in Germany, on Sunday. If we hit the early show at the one English-language theatre in Hamburg, we should have no trouble getting a seat. (Our first date 19 years ago was a Bond film, so we've always had a soft spot for the guy.)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Friday misc...</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still no word from VA Linux. A note on slashdot says to be patient. So I am. I tried calling, but the helpful folks couldn't find my name on any list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/scottfon.jpg&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;scottfon.jpg: Scott phoning home&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mama took a quiet day today. Her childbirth class had their final session here at our house last night. The 5 are all in Week 36 or better, and even the midwife is pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Userland for implementing the &quot;multiple days on the home page&quot; feature in Manila! That's a main feature of a squishdot site that can now be done in Manila by changing just one preference.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Linux fever...</title>
   <link href="https://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/09/linux-fever/"/>
   <updated>1999-12-09T12:12:58+00:00</updated>
   <id>https://www.papascott.de/archives/1999/12/09/linux-fever</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valinux.com&quot;&gt;VA Linux&lt;/a&gt; opened NASDAQ trading today with a bang... but I don't know if I made it on the train or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &quot;Debian&quot; developer, I received 'the letter', returned the paperwork, and received confirmation that my paperwork was received. However, German applicants this week received notice that due to problems with German securities regulations, German residents were not eligible to participate in the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on my paperwork I indicated that I am an American citizen, and I never received that notice. In fact, I have heard nothing about my application other than the notice that it had been received. However, as soon as I heard the price was set at $30, I sent in a confirmation of my willingness to buy at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called VA Linux this evening, and they could not find my name on any of their lists. But they are going to call me back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Red Hat, I also didn't know until a couple of days later that I had actually received my shares. We'll see what happens this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I just noticed that this site is No. 100 on the editthispage.com &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editthispage.com/SiteRankings&quot;&gt;site rankings&lt;/a&gt;, out of over 300 sites. I find it somewhat hard to believe that it is more interesting that over half of the other sites! The only advertising I've done was an ad on the weblog monitor... only because I wanted to remove the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mausnews.de&quot;&gt;Maus Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, but there's no option to remove an ad... only to change the URL and the graphic!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're still learning how to use the new camera (Nikon Coolpix 800, by the way)... good thing that we still have a couple of weeks to try things out. Here's a view of the future baby bed (should last for the first 6 months or so).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/dotty.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;dotty.jpg: Dotty the spotted cow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cradle is on loan from Roland and Kirsten (stuffed animals not included). The baby blanket with the cats is my original baby blanket, sent in by my folks in their Christmas package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue cow was my present to Mama the last time she was in the hospital... 1986 in Minneapolis. It was an ad promotion by the Polka Dot Dairy, and is likely the only one in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
