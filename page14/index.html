        Quiet Week
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>It's going to be a quiet week for us next week, the week before Easter. Not that we don't have enough to do, we have plenty of that. But our son is going to be away the entire week. He's flying by himself, for the first time, to Minnesota to visit his grandparents.</p>
<p>We noticed during our visit last summer that he was doing very well communicating in English, and, of course, as for any child his grandparents are the greatest. So we decided that this spring would be the right time for the first big trip alone. </p>
<p>We're sure the airline will take good care of unaccompanied minors (especially for the price!), but to minimize the risk of mistakes we are driving him to Amsterdam so he can fly non-stop to Minnesota, and will drive there again in a week to pick him up. Annoyingly, the direct flight from Amsterdam costs more than it would have to fly one-stop (in Amsterdam) from Hamburg.</p>
<p>We're all three feeling mostly excited but a just little bit scared. It's good that we we planned this trip for him alone, since the way our business looks we won't be able to get away for a family trip this year.</p>
<p>Our son will return home on Easter Saturday, so he can be at our local Easter fire with his Youth Fire Dept. comrades. He does, after all, have to keep his obligations.</p>

        Accidental Shots
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>We had sponsor tickets for yesterday's HSV match against Dortmund (we applied for the tickets last summer, so I obviously knew in advance that Dortmund would do well this year). I couldn't connect to Twitter in the stadium, so you'll have to take our word for it that we were there.</p>
<p>The sun was shining, the Dortmund fans were plentiful and in a good mood (Christopher thought it was funny that they were singing children's songs with, um, slightly altered lyrics), and in the end noone lost, so a good time was had by all.</p>
<p>I brought along our new camera, a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004026PE4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=papascott-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B004026PE4">Canon PowerShot SX130 IS</a>, to see how the zoom worked. Not bad for a 150 general purpose camera, but all you can do is point at a spot, hope for the action to get there, and get an accidental shot. The picture of Frank Rost cleaning the toilet paper out of his goal before kickoff is good, though.</p>

        Green Card

    <p><img src="http://www.papascott.de/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/greencard.jpg" alt="Greencard" border="0" width="300" height="300" align="right" />My wife had incredibly bad luck with her <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/greencard">green card</a>.</p>
<p>You may <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2002/09/09/young-dumb-and-excited/">recall</a> that she arrived in the US with a fiancée visa which, once the fiancée bit is consummated, so to speak, entitles one to permanent residence and a green card. The physical card was the problem. The INS managed to misspell her name on the card three times before finally getting it right, several months later.</p>
<p>Easy come, easy go. A couple of weeks after <a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2009/11/09/as-the-wall-fell/">we moved to Germany in 1990</a>, we took a day trip to Berlin to see what all the fuss was about. We got completely lost in the Friedrichstraße S-Bahn station (where the passport control for Westerners used to be, the maze of hallways were still there but absolutely no signs), and once we got out, her purse was stolen. Passport, ID, and green card, all gone.</p>
<p>We reported everything stolen, but we never had the green card replaced, since she was no longer a resident of the US, much less a permanent resident. We figured that was a detail we could take care of when we moved back the the States. As it turned out, that hasn't happened yet. <em>Cest la vie </em></p>

    <p>For those following along with the "<a href="http://www.papascott.de/archives/2011/03/23/lingua-franca/">which language will Christopher learn in the 6th grade</a>" contest, we have a winner. A full week before the deadline, he declared his decision for Latin, and we turned in the form to the school today.</p>
<p>Our preference was for French, and we even tried using to some reverse psychology (pointing out the advantages of Latin and hoping he'd argue with us), but that backfired. The main thing is that he made a decision and is happy with it.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who gave suggestions and played along.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>In the <em>Gymnasium</em> schools in our state, students start learning a second foreign language (after English) in grade 6. The schools we looked at all offered a choice from Latin, French and Spanish. The public schools all required a choice upon enrollment in the 5th grade, over a year before the courses would actually begin.</p>
<p>In Christopher's private school, they don't need to choose until April 1 of their 5th grade year. After winter break, the students had a chance to try out all 3 languages for a couple of days to help them make their decision.</p>
<p>The result for Christopher is... he wants to learn all 3, Latin, French and Spanish, and preferably Russian as well, but that's not a choice. :-)  So here we are one week before deadline, and we haven't made a decision yet.</p>
<p>Spanish will be offered as a 3rd language starting in 10th grade, so he can start that later. So now he's trying to decide between French and Latin, and he can't make up his mind. We'd prefer that he take a language that's spoken rather than most written, given his stutter, but he's not willing to let us decide for him.</p>
<p>I took a <a href="http://twitter.com/papascott/status/49937345893507072">quick poll on Twitter</a> the other night. The approximate counts were 8 for French, 5 for Latin (although a couple of votes seemed facetious), 2 for Spanish. One joke vote for German was not accepted. We'll let you know how it turns out.</p>
